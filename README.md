# **A Multimodal Framework for Oil Price, Supply & Demand Forecasting**

This project explores the use of **multimodal machine learning** to forecast key oil market variables — specifically **oil prices**, **global supply**, and **global demand**.  
Our approach integrates two complementary data sources:

- **Textual data**, derived from *OPEC speeches*, processed using modern NLP techniques  
- **Numerical market and macroeconomic data**, modeled using traditional and advanced time-series methods  

The objective is to evaluate whether combining textual sentiment signals with quantitative indicators can improve forecasting accuracy compared to purely numerical models.
