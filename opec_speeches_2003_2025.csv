"2025-10-03","Your Excellency Prime Minister, Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great honour to be here in Kazakhstan again.

Kazakhstan is a key participant in the historic Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers since it was founded at the end of 2016.

In this regard, I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, President of Kazakhstan, His Excellency Olzhas Bektenov, Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, and His Excellency Yerlan Akkenzhenov, Minister of Energy of Kazakhstan, for their ongoing support and cooperation.

I had the pleasure to visit Kazakhstan in 2024, and again earlier this year. In my meetings with Prime Minister Bektenov and Minister Akkenzhenov, we discussed the pivotal role that OPEC Member Countries and non-OPEC producing countries have played since 2016 in contributing to oil market stability and overcoming market challenges through the Declaration of Cooperation, often called OPEC+.

What was evident in all these discussions was one thing: the unity and resolve of all participants in OPEC+ that allowed us to take decisions focused on market stability, which not only serves the interests of producers, but consumers and the broader global economy too.

This was particularly relevant at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the OPEC+ production adjustment decisions literally pulled the industry back from the abyss.

Those decisions enabled the industry to recover in the subsequent years, with multiplier benefits for economies across the world.

In September this year, we celebrated 65 years of OPEC, and in December next year we will see the DoC reach ten years.

Both are momentous landmarks, and underscore just how important OPEC and OPEC+ have been to the global oil and economic landscape. I have no doubt they will also be vital for decades to come.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

For some, it might appear that the decisions OPEC and OPEC+ take are aimed solely at the short term, but this is not the case. We look at all timeframes.

We want to ensure we have a platform for future growth, for future investments and for future oil production. I cannot underscore enough how important this is.

Year after year, the world continues to consume more oil. In fact, last year, the consumption of gas, coal and renewables also reached record levels.

The world needs more from all energies, given that we see the global population rising to close to 10 billion by 2050; the global economy more than doubling in size over the same time period; the development of new energy intensive industries, such as Artificial Intelligence and Data Centers; and, rapid urbanization.

To put the last point in context, the urbanization drive will require the addition of approximately 360 cities the size of Astana by 2030 alone.

Of course, our energy future needs to be one where we reduce emissions, but it also needs to be one that delivers energy security and energy availability for all.

We need to remember the billions of people around the world that still lack access to modern energy services. The international community needs to ensure that these people have at least the energy basics that others take for granted, such as turning on a light, cooking on a clean stove or having motorized transport to travel to work or school.

The future is one that requires huge investments in all energy sources. In our World Oil Outlook 2025, we see the oil sector alone requiring investments totaling $18.2 trillion out to 2050.

For those that still believe that the world does not need new investment in oil and gas projects, I have a three-word response: ‘You are wrong’.

There is no doubt that the world has an abundance of oil and gas reserves, and it is clear that Kazakhstan has the resources and the potential to play a vital role in our oil and energy futures, with fields such as Tengiz and Kashagan.

Kazakhstan has proven oil reserves of around 30 billion barrels, or close to 2% of the world’s total. Moreover, it has significant gas resources and is well-positioned as a regional energy hub.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Future energy pathways must be driven by realism and pragmatism. At OPEC, we continue to advocate for an all-energies, all-technologies and all-peoples approach.

Where no energy source, or no-one is dismissed, and with pathways that are holistic, inclusive, fair and equitable, and in accordance with the core UNFCCC principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

What is clear is that oil remains vital to our future, just as it has been to our past. It is easy to understand why.

Imagine a world where petroleum and its related products did not exist. It would be one where transportation came to a halt, where food production was devastated, where health services were broken, and where economic growth would go into reverse. It is simply unimaginable.

Oil is also vital to economies and countries around the world, including here in Kazakhstan. Only last month, His Excellency President Tokayev, in marking Oil and Gas Workers’ Day, underscored the rich traditions of the oil industry, its importance to the country’s growth and development, and paid tribute to the more than 200,000 people currently employed in the oil and gas sector.

With that, allow me to conclude by saying that it is a great honour to be here at Kazakhstan Energy Week for the first time, and it will not be the last.

I wish the government, organizers and delegates every success with the event.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/391-3-october-2025.html"
"2025-09-30","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a pleasure to once again attend Africa Energy Week. Let me extend my sincerest thanks to the organizers and sponsors of this important event, especially NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the Africa Energy Chamber, for inviting me to speak.

It is always such a pleasure to come to the beautiful city of Cape Town, a true jewel. I look forward to this event each year with anticipation and have not missed an African Energy Week in South Africa since becoming the OPEC Secretary General more than three years ago.

But my history with South Africa goes back much further. When I was responsible for international markets at Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) I negotiated the first-ever long-term contract for the supply of Kuwaiti crude oil to South Africa in 1995.

Back then, four refiners – Sapref, Natref, Calref and Engen – agreed to purchase over 100,000 barrels a day (b/d) of Kuwaiti crude. At the time, South Africa was seeking to diversify its sources of crude oil. It was a very exciting time for me and cemented my deep ties to this country.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The past few months has seen a celebration of OPEC’s successful past and present.

Just over two weeks ago, we celebrated the Organization’s 65th anniversary. Since the seed of OPEC was planted at the historic Baghdad Conference back in September 1960, our Organization has become a respected multilateral partner and an established part of the international energy community.

Another example of high-level success was the 9th OPEC International Seminar held in early July in Vienna. It was truly a seminar for the ages, with many records broken.

Africa and African speakers also figured very prominently in our Seminar, highlighting the rising importance of this beautiful and varied continent to the world’s energy future.

I was very pleased that Jacob Mbele, Director General at the Department of Mineral Resources from the Republic of South Africa was in attendance.

NJ Ayuk was also a speaker at our Seminar and his passionate stand on having inclusive energy discussions is something that OPEC absolutely shares.

Mr. Ayuk talked about the hypocrisy of many countries in the developed world that while still funding fossil fuel projects are instructing African countries that they should not.

While acknowledging climate change, he added that wealthy nations that have benefitted from these resources need to decarbonize, while Africans need to industrialize. Simply put, they are at different stages of development, and this must be recognized.

Africa represents around 20% of the world’s population, but is responsible for only 3% of historical emissions, and it is further disproportionately affected by climate change. Thus, it is unjust to deny developing regions the right to develop and use their available energy sources. This is particularly true when so many people on the continent still lack access to modern energy.

In sub-Saharan Africa, 565 million still lack access to electricity, or 85% of the total worldwide, a figure that has risen from 50% in 2010. Globally, 2.1 billion are without access to clean cooking fuels, with sub-Saharan Africa again the hardest hit.

Developing countries are under particular stress to meet both the existing and future needs of swelling populations, while at the same time adapting to climate change and its challenges. There is no overarching solution. We must have a country-by-country approach to energy security, energy affordability and reducing emissions.

What was clear at the OPEC Seminar is that there is a growing understanding that the world cannot move forward without carrying everyone along, and taking account of national priorities, circumstances and capabilities.

This is very true for Africa.

The continent is an essential part of OPEC, with half of its Members coming from Africa: Algeria, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya and Nigeria. I am very happy to see several ministers from OPEC Member Countries in attendance today.

Today, Africa is repositioning itself in many ways in the global oil market. This applies not just to the supply side, but as an energy consumer too with a rapidly growing population and expanding industrial base.

OPEC’s most recent World Oil Outlook, released at the OPEC Seminar, shows the continent’s crude consumption rising from 1.8 million barrels a day (mb/d) in 2024 to 4.5 mb/d by 2050.

It is also set to remain a significant supplier of crude and condensate exports, although we see the level dropping from around 5.2 mb/d to 2035, to 4.2 mb/d by 2050, given the rapidly rising domestic use.

This growth is set to be supported by an expansion in the refining base, as well as the development of local reserves.

Africa has also the potential to be a main player in the future of energy, with oil and natural gas playing a leading role. Africa has vast oil reserves, over 120 billion barrels in 2024, or about 8% of the world’s total, with OPEC countries leading the way. Gas reserves are estimated to be at over 17 trillion cubic meters in 2024, or about 8% of global proven reserves.

What is central to this is investment.

One of the biggest barriers to advancing Africa’s oil industry is financing. In this regard, collaboration with multilateral institutions, to bridge the financial gap between rich and developing nations, and between the Global North and Global South is essential, as well as South-South support.

We are also taking steps to encourage and facilitate inter-OPEC Member Country cooperation, along with non-OPEC producer collaboration under the umbrella of the Charter of Cooperation.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to also add here that OPEC is working very closely with the G20 Presidency, held by South Africa this year. Critically, this is the first time an African country has assumed this role. It is a great opportunity to highlight the developing role and influence of Africa in shaping global energy discussions.

OPEC has provided the Presidency with three detailed studies to support this work. These are:

The broad focus of these studies underscores the importance that OPEC attaches to an all-energies and all-technologies approach to the future.

It is important not to have all our eggs in one basket. We need to embrace every available energy, and be realistic about what each can offer, and develop all technologies, including Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage and Direct Air Capture to help reduce emissions.

Our Organization supports Africa’s right to socioeconomic development and poverty eradication, Africa’s right to develop and monetize its own natural resources and Africa’s right to choose its own just, equitable and inclusive future energy pathways.

I wish you all a successful conference.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/392-30-september-2025.html"
"2025-09-29","Ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

It is always a pleasure to be back in London, a city that I called home for a number of years when working for the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.

I would like to thank my good friend, Dr Amrita Sen, Founder and Director of Market Intelligence at Energy Aspects, for the invitation to deliver this keynote address and the earlier introduction.

I last saw Amrita at the 9th OPEC International Seminar that took place in Vienna in early July. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Amrita for speaking at the event and for Energy Aspects being a sponsor.

It was truly a seminar for the ages, bringing together 23 ministers and government officials, 35 leaders from national and international companies and institutions and 12 heads of international organizations. In total, the Organization welcomed over 1,000 participants.

The Seminar’s success was reflected in its overall theme, ‘Charting pathways together: the future of global energy.’ The concept speaks to OPEC’s past, present and future, and of course, the importance of cooperation, and of working together to help deliver future energy pathways that are realistic for all.

Allow me to use this important platform to underscore five key insights from this Seminar. All of which I believe are vital for understanding the future of global energy from the perspective of the diversity of situations and needs of populations around the world.

First, as can be viewed in OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2025, global energy demand is set to rise by a huge 23% to 2050. This is driven by a variety of factors.

The world’s population is set to increase to around 10 billion by 2050, and at the same urbanization is set accelerate, with around 1.9 billion people moving to cities over the next 25 years.

To put this urbanization drive in some context, this is the equivalent of adding 210 cities the size of London to the global landscape.

The global economy is expected to almost double in size by 2050, with all the corresponding energy demand growth this entails.

In fact, emerging technologies in the global economic landscape, such as Artificial Intelligence, are leading to the need for massive data centres and considerable energy demand expansion. It is worth noting that global electricity demand since the start of the century has more than doubled.

It is also easy for all of us in this room to take energy for granted. Think of how we all travelled here and the hundreds of petroleum products that we passed along the way, and the many more we see in this room.

For billions, however, energy access remains a critical challenge, especially in the developing world, where over 660 million people still lack basic forms of energy and 2.1 billion lack clean cooking fuels.

Everyone deserves to live in a world where they have access to energy, and attending to this moral and ethical issue for humanity will require considerable energy additions.

Second, this energy demand growth can only be met by utilizing all energies and all technologies. Here, we need to understand just what each energy can offer in terms of energy security, affordability and reducing emissions, and appreciate that these factors are all intertwined.

In recent years, we have witnessed a marked shift in how the future of energy is being discussed. Policymakers in both the developing and developed worlds are once again recognizing that oil and gas are vital for future energy pathways.

In our World Oil Outlook, we see demand for all energies increasing, except for coal. Currently, oil is the main energy source for the global economy, but it is also expected to retain the largest share of the global energy mix in 2050 at around 30% – when demand is set to exceed 123 million barrels a day.

It is important to stress that we see wind and solar expanding at a growth rate of over 6% per year in the period. This is the fastest growth rate for all energies, but given the low starting base, wind and solar combined only reach a level of 13.5% of the global energy mix by 2050.

Let me highlight here that OPEC Member Countries are investing heavily in renewables, alongside investments being made in hydrocarbons. We believe this type of balanced approach is vital.

Renewables are not a panacea. This can be viewed in the challenges of intermittency, low-density and the large seasonal imbalances due to periods of low wind and solar generation. No economy can rely solely upon them.

They also require petroleum-powered vehicles and petroleum-derived products in their manufacture, construction and decommissioning.

It is important to view renewables at the global level from the perspective of a Total Levelized Cost of Energy, which includes the additional costs associated with fully integrating intermittent and decentralized sources like wind and solar. When full system-wide costs are factored in, the price of renewables rises considerably.

Moreover, renewables are not the sole option to reduce emissions.

We also need to recognize the importance of such technologies as carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) and direct air capture (DAC), as well as the promotion of the circular carbon economy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change views CCUS and DAC as having key roles to play in mitigating climate change moving forward.

Third, the global energy sector stands at a critical juncture, requiring significant investment in all energies and technologies. It is an issue that I have highlighted on many occasions since I became OPEC Secretary General.

For the oil industry to reliably supply markets and offset natural decline in mature fields, global cumulative investments of $18.2 trillion are required in the period to 2050. That is nearly $700 billion per year.

For those that believe that the world does not need new investment in oil and gas projects, I have a three-word response: ‘You are wrong’.

We have been consistently saying this for many years. We are happy to hear the tone on investments shifting more positively in recent times.

The potential implications of a shortfall are grave, as underscored in recent OPEC research. We see a huge market deficit of 23 million barrels a day by 2030 if investment in the global upstream industry stopped today.

Fourth, and related to the investment issue, developing countries must be empowered to use their natural resources – including to address energy poverty – and be supported by adequate finance and technology.

This was a point highlighted by many of our African Member Countries at the OPEC Seminar. Just as countries in the developed world have leveraged their hydrocarbon assets to develop their economics and provide for their citizens, so developing countries should be allowed to follow the same path in the future too.

Global climate and energy challenges must be addressed fairly, especially as Africa has contributed only around 3% to global annual greenhouse gas emissions, the smallest share of any continent. To put this in some context, the G7 is at over 43%.

Future energy systems must be just, equitable, and reflect national circumstances.

Fifth, governments, policymakers and industry leaders must take a realistic, data-driven view of energy realities and embrace inclusive pathways that follow an all-energies, all-technologies and all-peoples approach.

All inclusive, credible, forward-looking approaches are the only way we can meet the energy and climate challenges before us.

We welcome the realism and pragmatism that has evolved more recently in energy discussions. Away from ideology; away from wishful thinking.

Ladies and gentlemen

The all-inclusive approaches are a core focus for OPEC and its Member Countries, and we also recognize the value of stable and balanced markets to allow the world to deliver energy futures.

I know that many of you in the audience today will be traders, financial market participants, analysts, all of whom certainly follow developments of OPEC and OPEC+ affairs on a regular basis.

I would like to stress that we are fully open and transparent, we continue to monitor supply and demand fundamentals daily, and recognize how important short-term stability is for the long-term future of this vital global industry.

This has all been central to our DNA since the Organization was founded just over 65 years ago, and it has been evident in the proactive and pre-emptive decisions taken by participants in OPEC+ in 2025.

We recognize that our future is built on an understanding of both the past and present. Of taking informed decisions to help enable the huge investments required in the decades to come for an industry that is so pivotal to our daily lives.

By 2050, it will be the lives of almost 10 billion people, all of whom need today’s policymakers to embrace the realities we see before us.

I would like to conclude by saying that just two weeks ago at OPEC we celebrated our 65th Anniversary.

For 65 years, OPEC has delivered on oil and energy market stability and we will keep delivering oil to consumers for many more decades and beyond.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/390-29-september-2025.html"
"2025-07-10","Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for attending the 9th OPEC International Seminar.

I trust that these past two days have been engaging, insightful, and intellectually rewarding.

This year, in this most distinguished of settings, the Seminar reached new heights – setting records, providing a benchmark for success and fully reflecting its theme: Charting Pathways Together: The Future of Global Energy.

In line with this theme, and indeed OPEC’s commitment to inclusivity, the Seminar brought together an impressively broad array of high-level stakeholders – ensuring that all voices were heard.

Representing some of the world’s foremost energy decision-makers, and the pinnacle of ministerial leadership, we were honoured to welcome 23 ministers and government officials as speakers.

Among the foremost figures in global executive leadership, we were also delighted to welcome 35 company leaders to speak from national and international companies and institutions.

In addition, we were honoured to host 12 heads of international organizations, further enriching the high-level nature of the Seminar.

Overall, 71 speakers and seven moderators facilitated illuminating discussions and stimulating exchanges across three ministerial panel sessions and seven high-level, round-table sessions. To all our speakers, moderators, panelists and discussants – a big thank you.

Equally as vital as quality speakers, the Seminar would not have been possible without the kind and generous support of our 28 sponsors. Your contributions were instrumental in ensuring that all Seminar events unfolded seamlessly.

This year the Seminar has also teamed up with a record 24 media partners to enhance the reach of our proceedings. To all media representatives present – thank you.

We were also delighted to welcome over 1,000 participants from across the world, setting a new Seminar attendance record.

The numbers speak for themselves.

Charting pathways together takes a village. In this regard, I would like to warmly thank all OPEC Secretariat staff, as well as the consultants they worked alongside. Their professionalism and dedication were vital in preparing this Seminar. Thank you all!

Ladies and gentlemen,

Before concluding, I would like to highlight five key insights from the past two days that are worth noting for the future of global energy.

First, as highlighted in the World Oil Outlook launch, global energy demand is set to rise by 24% to 2050. Maintaining energy security will necessitate unprecedented local, regional and global collaboration to build resilient future energy systems.

Second, current and future data trends demonstrate that hydrocarbons will remain vital for decades. Oil is not only the main energy source for the global economy today, it is expected to retain the largest share of the global energy mix in 2050 at around 30% – when demand is set to exceed 123 million barrels per day.

Third, the global energy sector stands at a critical juncture, requiring significant investment in all energies and technologies. To meet future demand, maintain energy security and reduce emissions, global cumulative oil-related investments of $18.2 trillion are required to 2050.

Fourth, developing countries must be empowered to use their natural resources – including to address energy poverty – and be supported by adequate finance and technology. Similarly, future energy systems must be just, equitable, and reflect national circumstances.

Fifth, governments, policymakers and industry leaders must take a realistic, data-driven view of energy realities and embrace inclusive pathways that follow an all-energies, all-technologies and all-peoples approach.

Ultimately, the energy futures of 9.7 billion people in 2050 will depend on today’s policymakers embracing ‘all inclusive’, forward-looking approaches.

Thank you once again for ensuring that the ninth OPEC International Seminar was such an engaging and exceptional event.

I wish you all a safe journey home.

"2025-07-09","Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome to the beautiful city of Vienna and to the 9th OPEC International Seminar.

Once again, the magnificent and historic Hofburg Palace provides a spectacular setting for a joyous gathering of the OPEC Family, OPEC Friends and high-level dignitaries and representatives from our gracious host country, the Republic of Austria.

The first OPEC Seminar dates back to 1969 and OPEC’s vision for our Seminars is that they are first-rank, high-quality events in the energy calendar; ones that live long in the memory of all attendees.

To fulfil that vision, we have designed a rich programme with high-caliber speakers, stimulating discussions and topics that get to the very heart of the critical issues affecting the energy industry.

Indeed, I can surely say that there is no other event in the international energy calendar that gathers so many high-ranking petroleum and energy ministers, as well as industry leaders under one roof.

Over the course of the next two days, the Seminar’s many highlights include:

This will all take place under the official theme of the 9th OPEC International Seminar, ‘Charting pathways together: the future of global energy.’

The question that our Seminar theme seeks to address is how to strike a balance between achieving energy security, enhancing energy access, alleviating energy poverty while reducing emissions. This will be central to all our discussions.

Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Organizing an event on this scale is only possible through teamwork. A few words of thanks are due to those who have made our Seminar the special event that it is.

We are deeply appreciative to His Royal Highness, Their Excellencies, the Ministers from OPEC’s Member Countries and countries participating in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ for taking the time out of their busy schedules to attend this event.

Thanks also go to Their Excellencies, the other esteemed Ministers, as well as Ambassadors, dignitaries, the heads of international organizations, the chief executives of national and international oil companies, and all the other speakers, panelists and moderators.

I would also like to thank all our sponsors for their generosity, particularly our Diamond Sponsors:

and our Platinum Sponsors:

I would also like to thank our many Media Partners for this event. We are extremely grateful for their backing in realizing the vision behind this Seminar.

To our host country, Austria, and the City of Vienna, a big thank you. The year 2025 is a landmark one for us as we celebrate 60 years since OPEC relocated to Vienna.

Last but not least, my thanks also go to my colleagues at the OPEC Secretariat who have worked tirelessly in preparing for this event.

With that, I wish us all a pleasant, fruitful and stimulating Seminar.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/388-9-july-2025.html"

"2025-06-02","Your Excellency President Ilham Aliyev, Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

‘A Gift from God’ is how His Excellency Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan has described oil and gas resources.

It is a statement that will resonate in history for years and decades to come; they are words that truly matter. Not just for producers, but for consumers across the world too who utilize petroleum and petroleum-derived products in a host of everyday ways.

I would like to thank His Excellency Aliyev, not only for these wise words, but also for his continued support for of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

Your Excellency, you have shown great leadership over the years, having been a promoter of bringing OPEC and non-OPEC together and a strong advocate of the Declaration since its inception in December 2016, and we thank you for that.

In this, you have been ably supported by my dear friend, His Excellency Parviz Shahbazov, Azerbaijan’s Minister of Energy, who has been steadfast in his backing for ensuring the DoC continually works towards a balanced and stable market.

Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Petroleum and petroleum-derived products continue to shape our world. They are vital in so many ways.

In this regard, we need to remember that hydrocarbons still make up over 80% of today’s global energy mix, as they have since the 1980s, and provide energy for a wide variety of sectors and industries.

Imagine a world where petroleum and its related products did not exist. It would be one where transportation came to a halt, where food production was devastated, where health services were broken, and where economic growth would go into reverse.

Today, the world continues to consume more oil year after year. In fact, last year, the consumption of gas, coal and renewables also reached record levels. The world needs more from all energies, given population expansion in the developing world, urbanization, economic growth and the development of new energy intensive industries, such as Artificial Intelligence.

Yes, our energy future needs to be one where we reduce emissions, but it also needs to be one that delivers energy security and energy availability for all.

This leads me to three key points:

Firstly, our energy future should not be ideologically driven. It is not a world, like some would have us believe, where renewables and electric vehicles replace hydrocarbons. It is a world that needs consistency in messaging, and not flip-flopping as we have witnessed from some agencies in recent times.

In this regard, we must be realistic about what each energy can offer and ensure that all available technologies are utilized to help reduce emissions.

Secondly, we need to appreciate the needs of all peoples, with billions of people in the developing world still playing energy catch-up.

Future energy pathways must be holistic, inclusive, fair and equitable, and be in accordance with the core UNFCCC principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This was underscored at COP29 in Baku in December last year.

As we move from COP29 to COP30 later this year in Brazil, we also need to remember that the objective of the Paris Agreement is to reduce emissions; not replace sources of energy.

And thirdly, we need investments, investments and investments. For oil alone, we see investment requirements of $17.4 trillion out to 2050, or almost $650 billion per year.

It is vital that the necessary investments in all energies and all technologies are made, to help chart appropriate future energy pathways for nations and peoples around the world.

Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Azerbaijan has shown itself to be a leader when it comes to evolving future energy pathways, exhibited clearly in its constructive engagement when hosting COP29 last year and in its continued support of the DoC and sustainable oil market stability.

At OPEC, we look forward to continuing to work with Azerbaijan to help deliver a stable, secure and sustainable energy future for all. A future that requires all efforts to maintain oil market stability, and a future where we work together for the energies of the future.

Just as Azerbaijan has been the cradle of the modern oil industry, it is also the cradle of how an all-energies landscape can evolve: oil, gas, wind, solar and more. It is a path that OPEC and its Member Countries fully support.

This path is closely aligned with the key themes and objectives of the forthcoming OPEC International Seminar – our flagship event – that will mark its 9th edition on 9-10 July at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna.

We will be honoured to count on the valuable presence of HE Parviz Shahbazov, along with many distinguished friends from Azerbaijan and around the world at our Seminar.

With that, it is a great honour to be here at the opening ceremony of Baku Energy Week, and I wish the organizers and delegates every success with the event.

Thank you, Your Excellency.

Thank you to all.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/386-2-june-2025.html"
"2025-02-27","Excellencies, Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to begin by thanking Mrs. Olu Arowolo Verheijen, Special Adviser to the President on Energy, for hosting this session.

Three topics are at the heart of this panel discussion and, indeed, they are the great themes of our age. They are:

Much ink has been spilled on the nature of the world’s energy future. This is understandable given the enormous stakes involved.

We are confronted with the challenges of delivering energy security, meeting rising energy demand, reducing emissions, and increasing access to energy for those who go without.

For developing and emerging economies, like Nigeria, there is the additional challenge of generating revenue from producing our energy sources and using that to meet the development needs of our peoples.

Such challenges require policies that are clear-eyed, comprehend the difficult trade-offs that come with having multiple development needs, and are grounded in actualities. However, in recent years, the world has been bombarded by a swathe of policy recommendations, overly ambitious targets and arbitrary deadlines that amount to extreme wishful thinking.

These policies are usually packaged with slogans like: ‘go green,’ ‘electrify everything’, and for those directed at the oil industry, ‘leave it in the ground.’ Some voices create the impression that renewables alone could solve all of the world’s environmental, economic, development and social challenges.

This created momentum that led an institution like the International Energy Agency (IEA) calling for an end to investments in new oil and gas projects. If such calls were heeded, we can only shudder at the possible consequences for developing countries and Africa.

Of course, every ambitious policy proposal will eventually have a rendezvous with reality.

‘Renewables alone’ and ‘electrify everything’ as concepts pose some very serious logistical and infrastructural questions.

For example, the world currently generates approximately between 27,000 and 30,000 terawatt hours of electricity. According to some researchers this would need to increase to between 90,000 and 130,000 terawatt hours to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. That is a 3.5 to 5-fold increase in electricity generation in roughly, a 25-year timeframe ̶ an expansion unprecedented in human history.

For the requisite electricity grid infrastructure to achieve national energy and climate goals, 80 million kilometres of overhead power lines and underground cables, need to be added by 2040. That is the equivalent of replacing the entire existing global grid. The world has 15 years to do this.

The critical minerals essential to power lithium-ion batteries in EVs, wind turbines and solar panels, like graphite, copper and lithium, would have to be mined and refined at a scale and pace that has no precedent in human history.

This rendezvous with reality is long overdue.

Of course, the world must reduce emissions, but we need solutions not slogans.

We need policies based on facts and not fantasies.

We need an approach driven by data and not delusions.

What is our energy reality? This is a question that must be raised when we contemplate our energy future.

The year 2024 saw global oil consumption reach a record high of about 104 million barrels per day. That said, it is a record that 2024 will not retain for very long.

If we look at the trajectory of the global population, which is expected to rise to 9.7 billion by 2050; urbanization trends, with two thirds of the global population expected to live in cities by 2050; and the global economy expected to double in size from 2023 to 2050; global energy demand is set to increase.

Global primary energy demand is expected to increase by 24% to 2050. All forms of energy will be necessary to meet this growth. There is room and, indeed, a need for renewables to meet this expanded energy demand, but we cannot put expectations on solar and wind that they are unable to fulfil. OPEC forecasts that the share of oil and gas in the energy mix remains above 53% through to 2050.

In the long-term, we see global oil demand increasing to over 120 mb/d in 2050. As already highlighted, there are many underlying factors behind this projected growth, but at a more micro level the growth of demand for petrochemicals, to produce the petroleum-derived products that are such an essential part of modern life, will be critical.

To reliably meet expected oil demand growth, the oil sector is set to require cumulative investments of $17.4 trillion by 2050. Sustainable stability in the oil market is an enabling factor for an investment friendly climate.

For this reason, OPEC and its partners under the umbrella of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ are committed to taking collective actions necessary to contribute to sustainable oil market stability.

When we recognize the realities of our energy future, this adds a focus to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. OPEC Member Countries are active in this regard. We invest heavily in renewable technologies; carbon capture, use and storage or CCUS projects; direct air capture; hydrogen projects; efficiency improvements; methane reduction technologies; and this is the tip of the iceberg.

OPEC and its Member Countries are committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement, but we recognize that the discovery of oil and the thousands of products that are derived from it cannot just be wished away or reversed.

Our challenge is harnessing the potential of this great resource in ever more efficient ways, while reducing emissions. I am convinced technological innovation will be key in unlocking an emissions-free future.

While seeking to accomplish this goal, we can never lose sight of the plight of those who do not have access to amenities others take for granted. Approximately 685 million people worldwide lack access to electricity, and 2.1 billion do not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies; the vast majority of whom reside in sub-Saharan Africa.

What is clear when we assess all these interrelated challenges, is that Africa will play a crucial role in our energy future. The continent’s proven oil reserves amount to around 120 billion barrels. The world will need more of this oil in the future. Therefore, it is critical that the African oil and gas industry attracts the level of investment necessary to unlock this great potential.

OPEC’s role in this is contributing to market stability that offers reassurance and guidance to potential investors. Our market research and forecasting all point to the importance of Africa.

Additionally, we know from Nigeria’s countless contributions to our Organization’s successes, how rewarding it is to work in this great nation. So, we encourage all potential investors to look at Nigeria’s oil and gas industry.

My message is invest, invest, invest.

As I conclude this scene-setting segment of our discussion, I would like to pose to the panel a question on what they see as the key steps necessary for unlocking Africa’s energy potential and how investments can be scaled up.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/50-27-february-2025.html"
"2025-02-25","Excellencies, esteemed delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is my pleasure to welcome you to this 4th High-level Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue.

This year, we are pleased to hold this important event here in Abuja in conjunction with the Nigeria International Energy Summit.

We have had the opportunity to organize this dialogue in Africa for three years in a row now, with the last two meetings having been hosted in Cairo.

Allow me to also recognize my distinguished colleagues from our partner organizations.

Excellencies, I want to thank each of you for your ongoing support of this dialogue, which continues to move from strength to strength.

With six of our Member Countries hailing from this continent, OPEC continues to prioritize collaboration with Africa and its energy stakeholders.

This event is a key component in OPEC’s programme of dialogue initiatives, which also include the European Union, China, India, Russia, as well as international organizations and global corporations.

OPEC believes that cooperation and dialogue among all energy stakeholders are absolutely essential factors in effectively addressing our common energy challenges.

Considering our industry’s rapid evolution, this cooperation will become even more important in the years to come.

Our discussions today will cover some timely themes relevant to both the global industry and Africa. These include future oil demand, energy investment and finance, as well as the ever-evolving issue of climate change and energy transitions.

Before we proceed, I would like to briefly share a few of OPEC’s views on these important topics.

We see global energy demand increasing by 24% by 2050, driven by increasing populations, growing economies, rapid urbanization and the need to bring modern energy services to those billions who still suffer without.

In terms of world oil demand, we see it reaching 120 mb/d by 2050 and with no peak on the horizon. Non-OECD nations will be the main sources of this growth, with African oil demand almost doubling to reach close to 9 mb/d by 2050.

This healthy forecasted growth will require enhanced investment across the industry. According to our latest World Oil Outlook, we foresee cumulative oil-related investment requirements from now until 2050 to be approximately $17.4 trillion or around $640 billion per year.

For Africa, in the ground, the future looks bright. It has an estimated 120 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and around 18 trillion standard cubic metres of natural gas.

It will be crucial in the years ahead that policymakers and industry stakeholders across the value chain work together to ensure the necessary funding is secured to develop these resources across the world.

This will be vital for the economic and social development of nations and their peoples, and the industry’s future depends on it.

Those suggesting there is no need for new investment in the oil sector could not be more wrong. OPEC estimates a huge oil market deficit of 23 mb/d by 2030 alone if investment in the global upstream industry stopped today. The ensuing volatility would severely hamper economies, businesses and people across the world.

It is also important to emphasize that the industry’s future expansion will also depend on maintaining market stability.

In this regard, I would like to laud the ongoing efforts of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners of the Declaration of Cooperation who remain committed to ensuring stable energy markets, which is the foundation for incentivizing investments going forward.

On the topic of climate change and energy transitions, developing countries around the world, including those here in Africa, continue to balance priorities between the vital need to support the development of their national economies, while also adapting to ever-shifting dynamics related to climate change.

At the last COP in Baku, OPEC and its Member Countries made their voices heard, advocating for a balanced and fair process on issues related to adaptation, mitigation and the means of implementation, particularly with regard to climate finance and technology.

Our core message remains the same: there is simply no ‘one size fits all’ solution. Different countries around the world have varying capabilities and diverse needs.

Any future energy and climate roadmap must be developed in adherence to the core principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  namely equity, historical responsibility and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

This is crucial, particularly for Africa, to ensure that its unique circumstances are taken into consideration.

And, in this regard, we must also redouble our efforts to reverse the scourge of energy poverty. It is an unfortunate fact that still today, there are an estimated 685 million people with no access to basic forms of energy, the majority of whom are here in Africa. Additionally, there are about 2.1 billion who still have no access to clean cooking fuels.

This situation is simply not sustainable. Together, let us continue to collaborate as a global industry to advocate for the necessary support and resources to help turn the tides on this tragedy.

Excellencies,

Today, we will have the opportunity to examine these crucial topics in more detail, and I look forward to hearing your valuable insights and perspectives.

Therefore, with no further ado, allow me to turn the floor over now to my esteemed colleagues.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/365-25-february-2025.html"
"2025-02-19","Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a pleasure to be back in Riyadh for this 15th edition of the IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.

Allow me to begin by thanking His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia, for his welcoming words and wise observations.

Your Royal Highness, your support for this important event has been pivotal to its success, and the producer-consumer dialogue you have long championed continues to go from strength to strength. Indeed, this valuable forum for the mutually beneficial exchange of outlooks and ideas has become an important means of supporting energy market stability.

I would also like to extend my best wishes to the new Secretary General of the IEF, HE Jassim Alshirawi, and to thank you and your team at the IEF Headquarters for the excellent arrangements in hosting this year’s event.

I would also like to thank his predecessor HE Joe McMonigle for his positive contributions in recent years.

I am also very pleased to see HE Mohamed Hamel, Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, and HE Francesco La Camera, Director General of International Renewable Energy Agency, participating today as special guests.

Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

While economic growth in 2024 was relatively solid, the global economy continued to face a number of challenges, including elevated real interest rates, labour market constraints and some geopolitical headwinds.

It also saw relatively robust global oil demand growth, while further expansions of 1.4 million barrels a day (mb/d) are envisaged across both 2025 and 2026.

The year 2024 also saw the OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) strongly contributing to oil market stability.

In fact, it is worth highlighting that oil as a commodity was the least volatile during 2024. This is greatly due to the DoC’s effective and proactive contributions that have helped provide much needed confidence and predictability to investors and other energy stakeholders.

This is an indication of how important global energy dialogue and cooperation continue to be in supporting oil and energy market stability, for the benefit of consumers and producers, as well as the global economy.

Moving forward, OPEC and its non-OPEC partners in the DoC will remain vigilant in promoting stable and transparent energy markets, as they remain vital in underpinning energy security and investments.

Today, we will have a chance to exchange our respective organizations’ outlooks. In this regard, allow me to emphasize that OPEC’s analysis is grounded in accurate, transparent and data-driven analysis. It is also rooted in realistic thinking and strives to keep ideology and wishful thinking out of decision making.

We look forward to engaging with our dialogue partners to discuss our outlooks and how we see the global oil and energy markets evolving in the years ahead.

Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

We also look forward to sharing our thoughts during today’s additional sessions, which will focus on the shape and form of energy transitions in the medium to long term.

What is clear is that future energy and oil demand growth primarily lies in the developing world, driven by increasing populations, growing economies, rapid urbanization, and the need to bring modern energy services to those billions who still suffer without.

OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook sees global energy demand expanding by 24% to 2050, with oil demand reaching 120 mb/d by then.

These trends make it clear that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. It is not one or the other; instead, looming energy demand dictates that it must be all. No energy source can be dismissed.

Alongside recognizing the need for all energies, we also need to appreciate the need for all technologies to help maintain energy security and reduce emissions.

This means investing adequately – today, tomorrow, and many decades into the future – in a manner reflecting realistic assumptions about what each energy source and each technology can offer as we seek to reduce emissions.

Here, I would like to emphasize that OPEC fully supports global efforts to reduce emissions in order to ensure global climate objectives and a fair and balanced energy future for all.

At COP29, OPEC Member Countries were fully engaged and advocated for the unique circumstances of developing nations. Today, I would like to reiterate that the unique circumstances of developing nations must be taken into consideration and fully respected.

On key issues such as climate finance and technology, we also continue to highlight the need for adherence to the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities.

Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Allow me to conclude by noting that OPEC will continue to prioritize dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners moving forward, including at this very important annual event.

Towards this end, I look forward to today’s deliberations and wish us all a highly successful Symposium.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/364-19-february-2025.html"
"2025-01-18","It is a great honour to be here in Tripoli for the 3rd Libya Energy & Economic Summit, and to listen to the wise words earlier of HE Abdulhamid Al-Dbeibeh, Libya’s Prime Minister, in his opening address.

I would like to thank the Prime Minister and his government for the continued support of OPEC, as well as their backing for the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, widely known as OPEC+.

At OPEC, we look forward to continuing to work with the government’s Head of Delegation, HE Dr. Khalifa Rajab Abdulsadek, Libya’s Minister of Oil and Gas and his team.

I would like to also thank HE Abdulsadek for the personal invitation to deliver these remarks to Libya’s pre-eminent energy event. I wish the Organizer’s every success.

Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

Libya has been a key member of OPEC since it joined back in 1962, just two years after the Organization was formed.

Only nine years after that, in April 1971, the ‘Tripoli Agreement’ was put together, which can be viewed as a fundamental turning point in the history of the oil industry, and of OPEC. It enabled Member Countries to have a greater say over their sovereign natural resources.

Today, Libya continues to play an important role in the Organization, and in global oil markets, despite ongoing challenges.

Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

It is the unity and resolve of all OPEC Member Countries, and the broader OPEC+ group, which enables us to take decisions focused on market stability, which is in the interests of producers, consumers and the broader global economy.

This was particularly relevant at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the OPEC+ production adjustment decisions literally pulled the industry back from the abyss.

They enabled the industry to recover in the subsequent years, with knock-on positive impacts for economies across the world.

The attentive approach, based on precautious, proactive and pre-emptive decision making continues today, with OPEC+ ministerial meetings at the end of last year to delay and extend the timeline for the return of production adjustments to support market stability.

For some, it might appear that OPEC+ decisions are aimed solely at the short term, but this is not the case. We look at all timeframes.

We want to ensure we have a platform for future growth, for future investments and for future oil production. I cannot underscore enough how important this is.

What is clear is that this future energy and oil demand growth primarily lies in the developing world, driven by increasing populations, growing economies, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanization.

We see the global population rising from around eight billion today to 9.7 billion by 2050; we see the global economy more than doubling in size over the same time period; and over the short period to 2030 alone, it is expected that another half a billion people will move to cities across the world.

To put this in context, this urbanization drive will require the addition of approximately 420 cities the size of Tripoli.

We also need to remember the billions of people around the world that still lack access to modern energy services. The world needs to ensure that these people have at least the energy basics that others take for granted, such as turning on a light, cooking on a clean stove or having motorized transport to travel to work or school.

The future is one that requires huge investments into all energy sources. We see the oil sector alone requiring investments totaling $17.4 trillion out to 2050.

It is clear that Libya has the resources and the potential to play a vital role in our energy future.

The country has the largest crude reserves in Africa, at over 48 billion barrels. To put this in context, this represents around 3% of the world's proven oil reserves and over 40% of Africa’s proven oil reserves. Moreover, it has significant gas resources too.

It is also well-positioned as an energy hub on the Mediterranean coast, has a skilled workforce and as we can see from this conference it is open to investments and partnerships to develop its vast resources.

At OPEC, we fully support Libya’s expansion plans, and of course, I should note that half of OPEC members come from the great continent of Africa.

For Libya, for all OPEC’s African members, it is vital they have access to the necessary investment to enable their full potential and deliver the energy the world needs.

Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

What this conference’s agenda also emphasizes is a broad approach to further energy pathways, where nothing is dismissed.

Beyond oil and gas, there are sessions on renewables, as well as a host of technologies focused on the climate challenge.

It is an approach that OPEC fully advocates. We have no doubt the world will continue to need all energies and it will need to embrace all technologies. And, of course, we have to recognize the differing needs of all peoples.

We need to invest adequately – today, tomorrow, and many decades into the future – in a manner reflecting realistic assumptions about what each energy source and every technology can offer and given the need to reduce emissions.

Understanding this future, and planning for it, is a core part of the Charter of Cooperation (CoC) between OPEC and a number of non-OPEC countries. Libya again plays an important role, and we look forward to working with the minister and his team to advance the Charter in the coming years.

To sum up, I have no doubt that Libya can be at the forefront of future oil and gas production, in developing renewables, and in utilizing technologies to improve efficiencies and reduce emissions.

It has the natural resources and as we have seen today, it has the will. We wish the government and the Libyan people all the best in these endeavours.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/49-18-19-january-2025.html"
"2024-11-20","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Today, almost 180 years on from the birth of the oil industry in Baku, petroleum and petroleum-derived products continue to shape how we heat and cool our homes, construct our buildings and transport ourselves from ‘a’ to ‘b.’

Oil and gas remain vital to producers and consumers around the world. As Azerbaijan’s President, HE Ilham Aliyev emphasized at the opening of COP29, they are indeed a ‘Gift from God’.

They impact how we produce, package and transport food and how we undertake medical research, manufacture and distribute medical supplies. I could go on.

However, access to the benefits of these products – benefits often taken for granted – is far from universal. There remain 685 million people who do not have access to electricity and 2.1 billion who continue to rely on unsafe and inefficient fuels for cooking.

The great challenge at hand is ensuring energy accessibility, meeting rising energy demand, enhancing energy security while maintaining energy affordability, as well as reducing global emissions.

OPEC has consistently advocated a balanced approach where nothing and no-one is dismissed. We need to embrace all-energies, leverage all available technologies, and ensure that the needs of all peoples around the world are taken into account.

This means recognizing that the focus of the Paris Agreement is on reducing emissions, not selecting energy sources.

It also means developing, transferring, and financing all forms of viable technologies. And it means developed countries fulfilling their obligations to meet funding gaps and scale up climate finance.

Each Party will have to chart its own path to a sustainable future. The capacities, national circumstances, and development priorities of all countries must be considered to ensure that no one is left behind.

What is clear is that no ‘one-size-fits all’ prescription can overcome our climate and energy challenges. Inclusive dialogue and international cooperation, just as our Azerbaijani hosts have adopted, will be necessary as together, we work towards building a sustainable future for all.

We thank our Azerbaijani hosts for their gracious hospitality and the leadership they have shown in climate negotiations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/360-20-november-2024.html"
"2024-11-11","Distinguished speakers, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

I am pleased to welcome you to this 10th edition of the Technical Meeting on Asian Energy and Oil Outlook.

For ten years, this meeting has been a regular and welcome feature on OPEC’s calendar. It is a meeting that has shown its value time and again, and it continues to reinforce the deepening bonds this Organization has with Asia and its key energy stakeholders.

I want to once again welcome our colleague and OPEC’s friend Dr. Ken Koyama, Senior Managing Director and Chief Economist at the Institute of Energy Economics in Japan.

Dr. Koyama has a long working relationship with OPEC and we greatly appreciate him sharing his insights and knowledge over many years, along with his help in planning and preparation for this meeting.

Dear colleagues,

Asia is the most populous continent and will be the engine of economic growth and the epicentre of future energy demand.

Figures from our OPEC World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2024 show that India and China alone will account for more than 38% of global GDP in 2050. In addition, India’s GDP growth rate is set to average 5.9% annually between 2023 and 2050, the fastest among all regions.

It is economic growth, population expansion, an urbanization drive and the need to bring energy to those who continue to go without, that are set to be the region’s main energy demand drivers to 2050.

What is clear is that meeting Asia’s growing energy needs is going to require all energy sources. We see renewables playing an expanding role, but it is fossil fuels that are set to continue to dominate the global energy mix.

According to the Asia Development Bank, the continent accounts for more than half of global fossil fuel consumption, with fossil fuels providing around 75% of Asia’s energy today.

Looking ahead, the WOO sees expansion in all Asian regions for oil and natural gas demand.

From the perspective of oil, India is on a strong growth trajectory. The country’s demand is foreseen to more than double between 2023 and 2050, moving from 5.3 mb/d to over 13.3 mb/d. And although China’s oil demand growth is expected to somewhat moderate, it is still set to increase from 16.4 mb/d in 2023 to 18.9 mb/d by 2050, or over 15% of global oil demand by then.

In Other Asia (countries outside of India and China), oil demand is expected to rise from 9.3 mb/d in 2023 to 14.5 mb/d in 2050. This makes it the second-largest global contributor to incremental demand, after India, over the period to 2050.

Dear colleagues,

What Asia’s energy future, and our energy future globally requires, is security of supply and this can only be ensured with adequate and timely investments. For the oil industry alone, we see total cumulative requirements between 2024 and 2050 of $17.4 trillion, or around $640 billion p.a. on average.

We have all been hearing some ill-advised calls to stop investing in new oil and gas projects. This is irresponsible and could lead to future supply shocks and volatility.

All industry policymakers and stakeholders need to work together to ensure a long-term investment-friendly climate, with sufficient finance available. One that works for producers and consumers, as well as developed and developing countries.

While Asia and the world will need more oil and gas, not less, we also recognize our responsibility to continually reduce emissions.

The challenge is how to balance sustainable, equitable development with energy affordability and energy security, while addressing climate concerns. These intertwined issues have led to a great deal of debate among key stakeholders, and at times, polarization.

It is vital we keep in mind achieving universal access to modern energy under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, which continues to be an elusive goal. Although there has been progress, around 685 million people still have no access to electricity and 2.1 billion lack access to clean cooking fuels, with South Asia being one of the areas hardest hit.

According to the Asia Development Bank, more than 350 million people in Asia and the Pacific have only limited access to electricity and 150 million still have no access at all. Many more cook using unhealthy, polluting fuels. Altogether, this is hampering economic growth and social development, and limiting access to education and employment.

Dear colleagues,

We will hold two sessions today. The first is entitled: Oil and energy market developments: drivers, challenges and long-term global outlooks, which will incorporate the Asian perspective on these topics. The session will include an OPEC presentation on the recently launched WOO 2024, as well a presentation by the Institute of Energy Economics of Japan.

In the second session, entitled CCS, CCUS and other Negative Emission Technologies (NETs), we will discuss some potential solutions to the climate challenge. Great strides are being made in many technologies, and we believe that this can help drive a lot of the practical change required to reduce emissions and enable the ongoing role of the oil industry to meet the world’s energy needs. To that end, we will listen to presentations from Korea, China, India, Japan and the Global CCS Institute.

Dear colleagues,

It is clear that this dialogue continues to grow in importance as Asia’s energy needs grow. OPEC will continue to work on a constructive relationship with its counterparts in Asia and rest assured, OPEC will remain a reliable energy partner.

I look forward to stimulating discussions and debate during this meeting.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/363-11-november-2024.html"
"2024-11-06","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It gives me great pleasure to be here with you in Cape Town to take part in Africa Energy Week 2024.

Let me begin by thanking the organizers and sponsors of Africa Energy Week, in particular NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the Africa Energy Chamber for inviting me to participate in this important event.

I could not think of a more pristine location to host an event than here in Cape Town. This city’s splendid mix of natural beauty and rich history make it one of the world’s great treasures!

My compliments go to the organizers for the excellent and timely programme that has been developed for this year’s event and for the excellent arrangements and warm hospitality.

Africa Energy Week continues to go from strength to strength and is now a leading event on the global industry calendar.

I am extremely pleased to see many of OPEC’s Heads of Delegation participating here, as well as some that are part of the OPEC-non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates

I would now like to take just a few minutes to share with you OPEC’s views on the global oil and energy markets and some key issues impacting the oil and gas industry globally and here in Africa.

As far as the future of oil and gas is concerned, OPEC has a positive outlook.

We see a bright future ahead with significant opportunities for robust long-term growth.

To illustrate, let me share with you a few statistics from our latest World Oil Outlook, which was launched on the 24th of September in Brazil:

[if !supportLists]· [endif]We see global energy demand rising by an estimated 24% by 2050.

[if !supportLists]· [endif]This will be fuelled by a world economy that is expected to more than double in size, from $165 trillion in 2023 to $358 trillion in 2050.

[if !supportLists]· [endif]Driving this economic growth is a rapidly expanding world population, which is expected to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, with most of this growth seen in developing countries, such as here in Africa.

[if !supportLists]· [endif]Urbanization will continue to intensify. Over the next six years to 2030, around half a billion people are expected to move to cities across the world. This urbanization drive will require the addition of approximately 105 cities the size of Cape Town. And by 2050, more than 6.6 billion people are set to be living in cities.

These trends make it clear that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy needs. It is not one or the other, it is all.

Oil and gas are set to remain the predominant fuels in the energy mix with a combined share above 53% by 2050. Oil will retain the largest share at 29% and gas will be at 24%.

To ensure security of supply in meeting forecasted future demand, the industry will need to boost investment levels significantly in the years to come.

According to our research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from now until 2050 will amount to approximately $17.4 trillion or around $640 billion per year on average to meet growing demand requirements. The bulk of this is required in the upstream, where total investment needs are $14.2 trillion, while downstream and midstream are estimated to be $1.9 trillion and $1.3 trillion, respectively.

I am pleased to see that this important issue has been integrated into Africa Energy Week’s theme: “Invest in African Energies—Energy Growth Through an Enabling Environment.”

Securing this vital funding is essential to maintaining security of supply and avoiding unwanted volatility.

For Africa, in the ground, the future looks bright. It has an estimated 120 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and around 18 trillion standard cubic metres of natural gas.

It is vital that African countries can develop these resources, with access to the necessary funding and financing. This will be vital for the economic and social development of these nations and their peoples.

Excellencies, delegates,

In five days, COP 29 will get underway in Azerbaijan. OPEC and its Member Countries, the majority of which are in Africa, will be in Baku to help promote fair and balanced climate and energy outcomes.

Our goal is clear: to ensure the voices of our Member Countries are heard and that the unique circumstances of developing nations are taken into consideration and respected.

The fact is that still today, billions of people around the world are playing energy catch up, with no access to modern energy services.

For these people, many of whom call the African continent home, talk of achieving net zero is neither a priority nor a reality. They are focused on simply attaining basic energy requirements, such as lighting their homes, figuring out clean cooking solutions or how to find motorized transport to school or work.

Thus, on the issue of energy poverty, we urge world leaders to unite and advocate for the necessary support and resources to make a difference in addressing this important matter.

In this regard, OPEC and its Member Countries will be actively engaged at COP 29 to advocate for a balanced and fair process, particularly with regard to climate finance and technology, and one which continues to take into account the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities.

This is crucial for Africa, to ensure that any future energy pathways meet the unique needsof its citizens.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Looking ahead, I would like to emphasize that OPEC will continue to prioritize dialogue and cooperation with all of its energy partners, including here in Africa.

In this regard, we look forward to today’s OPEC-Africa Roundtable. This will take place after a video presentation of the World Oil Outlook.

The Roundtable will allow us to delve deeper into some of the key energy opportunities and challenges that Africa is facing.

We look forward to very engaging discussions and hope you will join us for that.

Thank you, and I wish us all a highly successful Africa Energy Week!","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/237-6-november-2024.html"
"2024-10-23","I regret that my schedule did not allow me to attend the 14th Austrian-Arab Economic Forum, but I am grateful for the opportunity to address you today.

I would like to begin by congratulating the Austrian-Arab Chamber of Commerce (AACC) on the 35th anniversary of its founding. This longevity is testament to the Chamber’s vital role as a bridge builder and facilitator of economic, cultural and scientific cooperation between Austria and Arab countries.

Like the AACC, OPEC’s work also depends on fostering dialogue and cooperation, be it at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, among OPEC’s 12 Member Countries, as part of the Declaration of Cooperation with 10 non-OPEC oil-producing countries, or with a host of external stakeholders.

In this regard, Vienna and OPEC share a special bond, with the city being home to OPEC since 1965. Our cooperation to date has borne many fruitful initiatives, such as the Vienna Energy Scholar Programme.

Now in its fourth year, the VESP was formed to strengthen OPEC’s relationship with Vienna, celebrate our extensive, shared history, and give back to the community. It does so by bringing together brilliant young minds and providing them with the knowledge to better understand today’s complex energy landscape.

Here, I would like to commend the thematic focus of this year’s economic forum, ‘Fossil Energy, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency’. It reflects the reality that no single form of energy can meet expected future energy demand alone. Instead, an “all-peoples, all-fuels and all-technologies” approach is required.

To demonstrate why, I would like to highlight five key points on energy demand, with a specific focus on oil.

First, globalenergy demand is set to rise.

Our recently released World Oil Outlook 2024 sees global primary energy demand increasing by 24% to 2050. There are many reasons for this, including expected increases in population, urbanization, the middle class and energy-intensive technologies, as well as the need to bring energy to the billions of people that still go without.

The global population is set to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, up from over 8 billion in 2023. By 2030, another 500 million people are expected to move into cities across the world. To put this in context, this urbanization drive will requirethe addition of around 249 cities the size of Vienna. The fifth billionth person is also expected to join the middle class before 2030, up from over four billion today.

Additionally, energy infrastructure is set to be challenged by emerging technologies. AI expansion and the corresponding demand for computing data centres, for example, is driving the fastest growth in US power demand since the start of the millennium, outpacing grid expansions.

We all want lower emissions, but we cannot ignore the world’s growing need for ample, reliable and affordable supplies of energy.

Second, our energy future requires massive investment – in all energies.

In this regard, calls to stop investing in new oil projects are gravely out of step with energy realities. Hydrocarbons make up about 80% of the global energy mix, with oil comprising around 30%. These huge contributions to energy security have remained largely unchanged since the 1980s.

In contrast, despite $9.5 trillion spent on ‘transitioning’ over the past two decades, wind and solarmake up around 4% of today’s global energy mix, while electric vehicles have a global penetration rate of between 2% and 3%.

This is not to undermine the importance of renewables or EVs, especially as their market share will increase. Instead, it is to highlight the scale of the energy challenges facing us for those rashly calling to stop investing in oil.

OPEC estimates that no new investment in the industry would see supplies fall by 23 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2030, resulting in huge volatility.

Third, this instability would be further exacerbated by the fact that global oil demand continues to rise, especially as ever more policymakers reconsider future energy pathways amid the implications of initial, unrealistic net zero policies.

At OPEC, we do not see a peak in oil demand by 2050. In our World Oil Outlook 2024, oil demand rises from 102 mb/d in 2023 to around 120 mb/d in 2050.

Fourth, it is crucial to recognize that long-term projections of strong oil demand growth are largely driven by the non-OECD.

Billions of people in the developing world are still playing energy catch-up. 1.18 billion live in areas so dark that they provide no statistical evidence of electricity usage from space, while 2.3 billion still lack clean cooking solutions.

To mitigate energy poverty, policymakers must ensure just and inclusive energy transitions that reflect all nations’ stages of development, in keeping with the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’. After all, all populations deserve comparable standards of living, electricity and clean cooking.

Fifth, regional imbalances underscore that the world needs to strike a careful balance between delivering the affordable energy products and services that people require, and reducing emissions.

Towards this end, OPEC Member Countries are investing in both renewables and oil to meet consumer needs. They are improving efficiencies, implementing low-emissions solutions and mobilizing cleaner technologies like carbon capture utilization and storage.

By investing in all fuels and technologies, many countries across the OPEC+ family – including the incumbent COP troika of the UAE, Azerbaijan and Brazil – are showing that it is possible to be leaders in renewables and hubs for technological development while producing the oil the world needs now and long into the future.

Ultimately, the energy futures of 9.7 billion peopledepend on policymakers adopting similarly prudent approaches and investing accordingly today.

With that, I would like to thank the AACC and the Union of Arab Chambers for the opportunity to address you, and wish you all fruitful discussions.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/236-23-october-2024.html"
"2024-10-10","Excellency, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome to the 5th High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue. It is a great pleasure to see our GECF colleagues joining us online.

I am also delighted to be joined by His Excellency, Eng. Mohamed Hamel, Secretary General of the GECF.

His Excellency continues to lead the GECF with dedication, skill and extensive knowledge; attributes that have been the hallmarks of all stages of his career, including his time devoted to OPEC affairs.

Hopefully you have all noticed that OPEC is currently engaged in an intense PR campaign to remind the public of how essential petroleum and petroleum-derived products are for almost every aspect of life. Healthcare, food production, construction, mining, and transportation ̶ none of these industries could function without petroleum and petroleum-derived products.

This is even the case with the renewables industry. A lithium-ion battery in an electric vehicle has four parts: an anode, cathode, electrolyte and a separator. Separators are engineered microporous membranes, typically made of polyethylene or polypropylene. These are petroleum-based products. Approximately 11 to 15% of the weight of an average wind turbine consists of petroleum-based products like fibreglass, resin or plastic. Taking a typical crystalline silicon solar panel as an example, 10% of this plastic polymer. If we had more time, I would go on.

This message about the sheer and utter dependence of our modern civilization and daily life on petroleum products is something that we repeat in all of OPEC’s communications, publications and speeches. We do it to raise awareness of the very serious repercussions if the calls we hear from some quarters, to stop investing in the oil industry or ‘leave it in the ground’, ever came to fruition.

Now, if petroleum is essential to modern life; when we include gas alongside petroleum in the equation, it brings home the fact that in 2024, the world remains well and truly in the hydrocarbon age.

From heating homes to cooking stoves to producing the synthetic fertilizers that are essential in producing the food to feed the peoples of this world, life without oil and gas is unimaginable.

In our recently launched World Oil Outlook 2024, we see the combined share of oil and gas in the energy mix remaining above 53% in 2050.

What this also underscores are how important investments are for both our industries. For oil alone, total investment requirements to 2050 are estimated at $17.4 trillion, or around $640 billion per year on average.

These energy realities remind us why the work of our two organizations is so essential and why cooperation between us is so important.

With some overly-ambitious net zero climate targets being unmoored from energy realities, and given we still hear voices calling for no new investments in oil and gas, it is vital that OPEC and the GECF have this type of high-level forum, alongside our talks at the technical level, to come together, exchange views and present a common front.

Throughout our discussions today on energy outlooks, data exchange and methodologies, the international legal environment in which we operate, future joint activities and the buildup to COP29, I have no doubt our exchanges will be grounded in realism.

So in conclusion, once again, I thank the teams, I thank the GECF Secretary General and I wish us all fruitful discussions today and in the future.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/231-10-october-2024.html"
"2024-09-24","Ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. Boa tarde.

I would like to welcome you all to the launch of OPEC’s flagship annual publication, the World Oil Outlook 2024.

It is a tremendous honour to launch this here in Brazil, and at such a major energy event, ROG.E, formerly known as Rio Oil & Gas.

I would like to thank the promoters of this event, the Brazilian Petroleum and Gas Institute, who do excellent work in supporting Brazil’s hydrocarbons sector.

And I would also like to thank His Excellency Alexandre Silveira, Brazil’s Minister of Energy and Mines, and his team at the ministry, for his close collaboration and support.

This is my third visit to Brazil since I became OPEC Secretary General in August 2022, including an extremely engaging meeting with the President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in October 2023. The President has a clear understanding of the energy challenges before us, and at OPEC we look forward to working with the government in the years ahead.

It all highlights the positive and ever-expanding cooperation between Brazil and OPEC, which is further underscored through the Charter of Cooperation (CoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC countries.

This is a voluntary framework for dialogue and a platform for multilateralism on a host of energy issues, many of which are analyzed and elaborated on in this year’s World Oil Outlook.

The Charter offers inclusivity and broad dialogue, a means to bring all stakeholders together, which is evidently in line with Brazil’s approach to its G20 presidency in 2024, as well as its hosting of COP30 in 2025.

Holding the Presidency of the G20 and hosting COP30 back-to-back demonstrates Brazil’s unwavering commitment to finding solutions to issues of great importance and scale, and in this regard, I would like to offer the OPEC Secretariat’s full support.

The launch of the World Oil Outlook 2024 is a core part of this. The Outlook is central to OPEC’s embrace of transparency through dialogue and cooperation, and in helping provide a better understanding of all the intertwined issues that filter into our energy futures.

It is important to highlight the fact that ‘futures’ is plural. Energy futures mean different things to different people. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, there is no singular road ahead, and we need to recognize that there are different national circumstances.

What is clear is that future energy and oil demand growth primarily lies in the developing world, driven by increasing populations, growing economies, an expanding middle class and rapid urbanization.

Over the next six years to 2030, it is expected that another half a billion people will move to cities across the world. To put this in context, this urbanization drive will require the addition of approximately 74 cities the size of Rio de Janeiro.

We also need to remember the billions of people around the world that still lack access to modern energy services, including in Brazil. For these people, their energy future is not about thoughts on net zero. It is about achieving the energy basics that others take for granted, such as turning on a light, cooking on a clean stove or having motorized transport to travel to work or school.

The Outlook looks to shine a light on these issues and provide context to a future where we see global energy demand expanding by 24% to 2050.

What this underscores is that the world will continue to need all energies. It is also a future in which we need to embrace all technologies. And what this means is massive investment across the whole energy mix.

We need to invest adequately – today, tomorrow, and many decades into the future – in a manner reflecting realistic assumptions about what each energy source can offer and given the need to reduce emissions.

These issues will be highlighted in more detail in the presentation on the Outlook that follows.

Let me stress here that we see Brazil as a leader in how countries determine their own energy futures.

Brazil generated 89% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2023, leading the way in the G20, and is also South America’s largest oil producer. OPEC’s World Oil Outlook sees Brazil’s liquids output rising to 5.1 million barrels per day by 2029.

Like Brazil, OPEC Member Countries are investing in renewables, and in oil, to ensure that consumer demands are met. At the same time, they are also working hard to improve efficiencies, implement low-emissions solutions and mobilize cleaner technologies like carbon capture utilization and storage, clean hydrogen technologies, direct air capture, and carbon dioxide removal, all within the concept of the circular carbon economy.

Prudent energy policymaking to meet the world’s energy and climate challenge in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, should be steeped in real-world data, as embodied by our World Oil Outlook.

We need to ensure energy security, utilize all energies, deliver energy affordability and reduce emissions. These challenges are all intertwined.

The future has to be one where all stakeholders have a seat at the table, where all voices are heard. The World Oil Outlook is a key part of OPEC’s voice on our evolving energy futures, as this will be true of the 9th OPEC International Seminar that will take place in Vienna on 9-10 July next year.

The Seminar looks to foster dialogue and cooperation among industry stakeholders by facilitating open and candid discussions on topical issues affecting the petroleum and energy sectors. I invite all of you to attend.

With that I would like to handover to….","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/232-24-september-2024.html"
"2024-09-23","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning. Bom dia.

It is a great pleasure to be here in Brazil, a country that holds special memories for me as a place that I once called home. It is also an honour to speak at the opening ceremony of ROG.e

This event, one of the world’s leading energy exhibitions and conferences, is testament to the importance Brazil places on its energy sector. This can be viewed at all levels.

In October 2023, I had the honour of meeting with the President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The President has a clear appreciation of the energy challenges and opportunities before us, both in Brazil, and more broadly, at the global level.

In this, he is ably supported by His Excellency Alexandre Silveira, Brazil’s Minister of Energy and Mines. I have spoken with Minister Silveira on many occasions, and at OPEC, we look forward to working with him and his team in the years ahead.

I would also like to express my appreciation to the Brazilian Petroleum and Gas Institute, the promoters of this event. The work they do is vital for the success and advancement of the Brazilian energy industry, and having seen their research and development at close quarters, I have no doubt that the Institute’s efforts will be important for the global energy sector.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

OPEC continues to advocate for an all energies and all technologies approach to deliver just and equitable energy pathways for all peoples around the world.

This means understanding the interlinkages between the three energy imperatives: energy security, energy affordability, and emission reductions.

In reality, this necessitates adequate investments – today, tomorrow, and many decades into the future – in a manner reflecting realistic assumptions about what each energy source can offer, while improving their environmental credentials.

For Brazil, it is demonstrating that it is possible to be a leader in renewables, produce the oil the world needs now and long into the future, and enable technological developments and breakthroughs. Brazil generated 89% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2023, leading the way in the G20. It is South America’s largest oil-producer, and the Brazilian Petroleum and Gas Institute is to the fore in new technologies.

Like Brazil, let me say that OPEC Member Countries are investing in renewables, and in oil, to ensure that consumer needs are met.

At the same time, they are also working hard to improve efficiencies, implement low-emissions solutions and mobilize cleaner technologies like carbon capture utilization and storage, clean hydrogen technologies, direct air capture, and carbon dioxide removal, all within the concept of the circular carbon economy.

Providing a better understanding of these issues is a core focus of the Charter of Cooperation (CoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC countries, a voluntary framework for dialogue and a platform for multilateralism.

We welcome Brazil’s attention to the CoC, and let me state, at OPEC, we truly value our ever-evolving collaboration, at all levels.

This includes the launching of OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2024 at the ROG.e tomorrow. The Outlook is central to OPEC’s embrace of transparency through dialogue and cooperation, and in helping provide a better understanding of all the intertwined issues that filter into our energy futures. I hope that many of you here can join us.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Before concluding, I would also like to take this opportunity to offer OPEC’s support for Brazil’s G20 presidency in 2024, as well as its hosting of COP30 in 2025.

Brazil is leading the way in helping find realistic solutions to the energy challenges of our time. Its inclusive and diplomatic approach should be lauded, and it is an approach that OPEC will continue to advocate for.

We need all voices at the table, not just a few. And we need to take on board the different national circumstances, pathways, and approaches for countries and populations in evolving future energy pathways.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/233-23-september-2024.html"
"2024-06-04","Your Excellency President Ilham Aliyev, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great honour to be here at the opening ceremony of Baku Energy Week. Azerbaijan, under the able leadership of His Excellency Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan is a great friend of OPEC and supporter of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

In fact, His Excellency President Aliyev, was one of the leaders that helped bring OPEC and non-OPEC producers together back in 2016. His continued backing since then has enabled the DoC to become a cornerstone in maintaining a balanced and stable market, in the interests of producers and consumers, and ultimately the wider global economy.

In this, he has been ably supported by His Excellency Parviz Shahbazov, Azerbaijan’s Minister of Energy, who has shown tireless dedication to our common endeavours.

I would like to start by quoting something very important expressed recently by His Excellency President Aliyev. He said and I quote “as a head of the country, which is rich with fossil fuels, of course, we will defend the right of these countries to continue investments and to continue production.”

His Excellency added that abundant hydrocarbons were a “gift from God.”

These are extremely important words, and these precious resources are indeed a “gift from God”. They have brought tremendous benefits to the world. Oil and its commonly known associated products help power cars, ships and airplanes, light and heat homes. But oil also enables the development of plastics, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.

This is far from an exhaustive list, but underscores the importance of oil to our everyday lives. It is vital for energy security. It is vital in helping alleviate energy poverty. And it will be vital for sustainable development in the future, given the needs of all peoples around the world.

These issues were on the agenda when we warmly welcomed His Excellency Mukhtar Babayev, Minister for Ecology and Natural Resources of Azerbaijan and COP29 President-Designate to the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna only two weeks ago.

Alongside his distinguished team, as well as high-ranking officials from OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the Charter of Cooperation, it was extremely positive to hear Azerbaijan’s adoption of an inclusive approach to COP29. One that listens to all views, including those of the oil industry.

We support Azerbaijan’s constructive engagement for COP29, with a focus on the importance of enhancing international cooperation in climate action to advance the objectives, principles, and goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and its Paris Agreement.

We need to allow each country to chart its own path based on its national circumstances, taking into account the principles of equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

It is important to keep this in mind. It is pathways, not a pathway as some would have us believe. We need to appreciate the different circumstances of nations and peoples across the world.

Billions of people are still playing energy catch up.

Billions of people still have no access to modern energy services.

And many more billions have never owned a car or travelled outside of their home country.

Future energy pathways need to take on board this and emphasize an all-energies and all-technologies approach.

OPEC fully advocates this, and alongside investing in oil, our Member Countries are also investing in gas, renewables, nuclear, hydrogen, carbon capture utilization and storage facilities, carbon dioxide removal, direct air capture and promoting the circular carbon economy.

We also welcome Azerbaijan’s ambitious plans to produce a diverse portfolio of energy, including oil, gas, and other strategic sectors like offshore wind power and hydrogen.

These will all be crucial given that we see global energy demand increasing by 23% by 2045.

Your Excellency President Aliyev, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

At OPEC, we also believe the planet we all live on is a “gift from God”.

It is why our Member Countries are so serious about the world taking the best and most just future energy pathways. Pathways that provide for energy security, do no impede socio-economic development, enable the necessary investment in all energies and all technologies, and help reduce emissions.

Given President Aliyev’s wise words, I am confident that Azerbaijan understands the importance of this, particularly given that the country and Baku are known as the cradle of the modern oil industry.

The location of many ‘firsts’ in the industry’s great ‘oil boom’ in the latter half of the 19th century, a time when some of the industry’s greatest minds thrived, and fundamentally changed the world forever.

Azerbaijan appreciates the value of oil, and what it has helped deliver to the world.

With that, I wish the organizers and delegates at Baku Energy Week every success with the event.

Thank you, Your Excellency,

And thank you to all.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/235-4-june-2024.html"
"2024-04-30","Excellencies, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning to you all.

It is a great pleasure and indeed an honour to be here today at the prestigious Federation of Austrian Industries.

In preparing for this meeting, I was fascinated to learn that this historic building, aptly called the “House of Industry”, was designed by renowned architect Karl König and inaugurated by Emperor Franz Joseph on 25 March 1911. This splendid edifice is truly an historical landmark and just one more example of what makes Vienna such a magnificent and culturally rich city.

Before I continue, allow me to thank the following esteemed leaders for inviting me to participate in this special meeting:

[if !supportLists]· [endif]HE Former Minister Dr. Werner Fasslabend, President of the Austro-Arab Chamber of Commerce

[if !supportLists]· [endif]Mr. Mouddar Khouja, Secretary General of the Austro-Arab Chamber of Commerce

[if !supportLists]· [endif]Mr. Georg Knill, President of the Federation of Austrian Industries, our host here today; and

[if !supportLists]· [endif]HE Abdullah Tolah, President of the Arab Ambassadors Council and Ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to Austria.

I am pleased to see so many esteemed Ambassadors representing OPEC Member Countries, as well as non-OPEC countries of the Declaration of Cooperation, in addition to the Director General of the OPEC Fund for International Development, HE Abdulhamid Alkhalifa.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Since 1946, the Federation of Austrian Industries has been dedicated to promoting Austrian industry both within Austria and throughout Europe.

Today, its 4,500 members make up more than 80% of domestic manufacturing companies. This, of course, includes Austria’s important energy sector.

I was very impressed to learn that the ""Producing sector"", which includes manufacturing, mining, energy and water supply, as well as construction comprises 67,000 Austrian companies, employs about one million people and generates nearly 29% of the domestic GDP.

These numbers make it clear that industry, and particularly the energy sector, continue to play a crucial role within the wider Austrian economy.

From a global perspective, OPEC sees a bright future ahead for energy with robust long-term growth expected for oil and gas.

Let’s consider these statistics:

[if !supportLists]· [endif]We see energy demand rising by an estimated 23% by 2045, reaching close to 359 mboe/d in 2045

[if !supportLists]· [endif]This will be fueled by a world economy that is expected to double in size, growing from $138 trillion last year to $270 trillion in 2045

[if !supportLists]· [endif]We also forecast a rapidly expanding world population that will surpass 9.5 billion people, with most growth seen in non-OECD developing countries

[if !supportLists]· [endif]Urbanization alone will account for over half a billion people moving to cities around the world by 2030. To put this figure into an understandable context, Vienna’s population is 2 million. That equates to 300 new Viennas from now to 2030!

These are the realities we see based on our data and research, and it means that the world will require all forms of energy to meet the rapidly growing energy needs over the long term.

Yes, renewables will expand at a faster rate in the decades to come, but oil and gas will still be the predominant fuels in the energy mix.

In fact, oil alone will retain its share at almost 30% in 2045 as world demand for oil soars to an estimated 116 mb/d by that time. Other major energy forecasters are in agreement with OPEC on this, including the US Energy Information Administration, which sees global oil demand rising to a level of 120 mb/d by 2050.

To meet this level of demand, the industry will need to significantly ramp up investment. According to our research, cumulative oil-related investment requirements from now until 2045 will amount to approximately $14 trillion or around $610 billion on average per year.

Securing this vital funding is essential if we hope to maintain security of supply and avoid unwanted volatility in the years ahead.

Despite these facts, I am certain you are aware of some predictions for peak demand by 2030 and calls for a discontinuation of investment in hydrocarbons.

These voices are unfortunately not in touch with reality, and their views are not based on robust research and data.

Right here in Europe and across the world, we are seeing large corporations and governments re-evaluate and re-calibrate their transition strategies and timelines based on the realities I have just described. Indeed, the rush to adopt “Net-Zero” strategies was misguided and simply not realistic.

For example, we have recently seen reports of automakers scaling back or delaying their production of electric vehicles, with some even declaring bankruptcy. Moreover, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association reported that sales of battery-powered cars dropped by 11.3 per cent in Europe during March due to a decrease in demand.

Policymakers are also coming to terms with the significant challenges related to electricity grids, battery manufacturing capacity, critical minerals and rising costs due to high inflation.

These realities are resulting in some renewables projects being delayed or even discontinued due to rising costs and supply chain constraints.

Excellencies,

Let me make it clear that OPEC fully supports the need to reduce emissions and address climate change, but this cannot come at the cost of energy security, and it will not happen overnight.

Energy transitions in the past have taken decades to evolve, and have typically added energies to the mix, not taken them away, as advocated in some circles today.

At COP28, OPEC’s Member Countries made their voices heard in advocating for a balanced, equitable and inclusive approach to addressing climate change − one that is realistic, pragmatic and one that considers the unique capacities and circumstances of developing countries.

After all, there is no “one size fits all solution” – there are multiple pathways to achieving the same objective.

In this regard, we must also not neglect the dire needs of the billions still living in energy poverty, and this means ensuring that no one is left behind in any energy transition.

Another important area I would like to underline is the key role of technology.

The oil industry has been a world-leading technology innovator since its inception, and I believe it can leverage this expertise to enhance the world’s efforts to reduce emissions.

Many of our Member Countries have been active on this front for years, advancing innovative projects such as carbon capture utilization and storage, direct air capture and circular carbon economy approaches, not to mention the wide adoption of renewables.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

To sum it up, OPEC is advocating for a holistic approach to our energy future.

It will be an approach that leverages all energies, employs all technologies and respects the circumstances of all people.

It is an approach that is balanced and inclusive − benefiting energy producers, consumers and the global economy.

Indeed, this energy future we envision will offer hope, opportunity and prosperity for the generations to come.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/238-30-april-2024.html"
"2024-03-19","​Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Allow me to warmly welcome His Excellency, Zhang Jianhua, Administrator of the National Energy Administration of the People’s Republic of China, and his delegation to the OPEC Secretariat for the 7th High-level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue.

The Chinese philosopher and thinker, Confucius, was correct in stating how delightful it is to have friends coming from afar. Your Excellency, we greatly value your presence here today, and hope to be able to return the hospitality my team and I enjoyed in Beijing at the 6th High-level Meeting of our dialogue last May.

I would also like to extend a very warm welcome to our good friend, the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations and other International Organizations in Vienna, His Excellency, Ambassador LI Song.

Through the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue, our pragmatic framework for cooperation has never been stronger. Indeed, our regular exchanges of views – at all levels – on energy issues of common interestremain extremely valuable, contributing to stability in the oil market in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy alike, and in helping meet the challenges we face in evolving a sustainable energy future for all.

Against this backdrop, I look forward to today’s discussions on various topics, including following up on the 6th High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue; exchanging views on global energy market outlooks; considering the future of oil in energy transitions; and exploring areas of cooperation between China and OPEC.

On the latter, since our last meeting, I was pleased to send a video address to the 2023 International Forum on Energy Transition, held in Jiangsu Province in September 2023. It was also an honour to accept Ambassador Li’s kind invitation to participate in the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations on 31 January this year, marking the onset of the Year of the Wood Dragon. The Wood Dragon heralds good fortune and represents unprecedented opportunity – an apt metaphor for our relationship.

In addition, we appreciated that students from China participated at the 8th OPEC International Seminar in July 2023 and that – at the technical level – analysts and researchers from the OPEC Secretariat continue to regularly liaise with their counterparts in China’s National Energy Administration.

Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

President Xi Jinping’s vision for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has been one of the most significant global economic developments this century.

China is central to the continued expansion of the global economy, and earlier this month, at the National People’s Congress, His Excellency Premier Li Qiang underlined China’s GDP growth target of around 5% for this year, the attainment of which will undoubtedly benefit the global economy.

In this respect, OPEC Member Countries – which accounted for almost half of China’s total crude oil imports in 2023 – will continue to act as reliable partners in providing the affordable energy China needs to drive its growth.

OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report noted that China was expected to be the engine of global oil demand growth in 2024, aided by expected healthy economic and manufacturing activity, growing domestic demand for petrochemical products, and robust driving activity and air transportation.

Highlighting how strong air transportation demand in China is in recent times, a report by China’s Civil Aviation Authority recently noted that passenger turnover on domestic routes jumped by 147%, year-on-year (y-o-y), in December 2023, while international routes recorded an astounding 905% y-o-y increase in terms of passenger kilometres travelled.

Looking at medium-term oil demand, according to the 2023 OPEC World Oil Outlook (WOO), the country with the largest incremental oil demand growth from 2022 to 2030 is projected to be China, at around 3 million barrels per day (mb/d), reaching a level of around 18 mb/d in 2030.

Overall, we see global oil demand rising to 116 mb/d by 2045, requiring industry investments totaling $14 trillion to 2045, or around $610 billion on average per year.

In this regard, we need a long-term stable investment-friendly climate, one that works for producers and consumers, and this stability is something that OPEC and its partners in the Declaration and Cooperation will continue to push for.

Your Excellency, at every step of the way, OPEC and its Member Countries will be there to provide the affordable energy that China will need to meet its rising energy demand, with our interconnectedness in the sphere of energy underlining the strength of our relationship.

On this note, and without further ado, I would like to pass the floor to His Excellency, Administrator Zhang.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/51-19-march-2024.html"
"2024-03-02","Your Excellency President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, Excellencies, Heads of State of Member Countries of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), Ministers and Ambassadors, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/52-2-march-2024.html"
"2024-02-27","I would like to begin by thanking our moderator, Professor Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, former Minister of State for Petroleum and head of Nigeria’s delegation to OPEC. We are grateful for his contributions to our Organization, especially when he was President of the Conference in 2015.

The theme of this panel discussion is ‘Navigating the new energy world order: Security, Transition and Finance.’ There are a multitude of ways in which we could tackle these important topics, but I would like to cast our minds back a few months ago to COP28, held in another OPEC Member Country, the UAE.

The Emirati Presidency should be commended for their inclusive approach, ensuring all voices were heard, including the oil industry’s, and the testimony to this was the quality of the outcome, as reflected in the text of the ‘First Global Stocktake’, which was historic on many levels.

However, in the buildup to the COP there were several prominent figures demanding that the oil industry be excluded from the process. This is part of a mistaken narrative around climate change and the future of the industry. It is one detached from reality.

This discord stems from the fact that there is no one universally accepted definition of ‘energy transition.’ The concept differs depending on perspective. How an energy transition is imagined in Western Europe is different to how it is will be experienced here, in Africa.

Energy transitions are different for the 675 million people worldwide who lack access to electricity, four out of five of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa. They are very different for the 2.3 billion people without clean fuels and technologies for cooking.

In recognition of these realities, the original United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Treaty from 1992, which was ratified by all 197 participating countries, enshrined the principle that:

“The global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and their social and economic conditions.”

This principle was further reiterated in the ‘Global Stocktake’ from COP28, which calls on parties to

“To contribute to the following global efforts, in a nationally determined manner, taking into account the Paris Agreement

and their different national circumstances, pathways and approaches.”

Furthermore, it calls for “just, orderly and equitable” energy transitions.

With a challenge as complex as climate change, “one-size-fits-all” prescriptions will never work. A broad range of mitigation measures and multiple pathways are necessary to address it.

Despite this, there are erroneous attempts to frame energy transitions as a single pathway with one single formula, namely, halting oil and gas.

Such thinking is a form of denialism – it denies reality.

It denies the fact that petroleum and products derived from it are essential for daily life across the world.

It denies the fact that disruption or instability in the global oil market has harmful consequences, affecting the most vulnerable members of society.

It denies the reality that for many oil-producing developing nations, oil production is a way to generate revenue streams that help address other pressing and legitimate needs, such as development, reducing poverty and paying for public services.

What was heartening before and after COP28 was the African leaders who articulated this clearly in their pronouncements. For example, Nigeria’s Honourable Minister of State for Environment, HE Dr Ishaq Salako said,

“Asking Nigeria, or indeed, asking Africa, to phase out fossil fuels is like asking us to stop breathing without life support. It is not acceptable and it is not possible.”

Additionally, Uganda's Minister of Energy and Mineral Development, HE Ruth Nankabirwa Ssentamu said on the margins of the COP,

“Countries like Uganda... must be allowed to develop her natural resources in order to get money to transit from darkness to light.”

As HE Tom Alweendo, Namibia’s Minister of Mines and Energy, has recently written,

“The economic and social benefits derived from fossil fuels are still crucial for [African nations] – from reducing energy poverty to bolstering our economies. Moreover, we believe that these benefits can be harnessed in tandem with addressing climate change concerns.”

Addressing climate change is not a binary choice about selecting one energy source over another. It requires the inclusive ‘à la carte’ range of options which can be seen in COP28’s ‘Global Stocktake’ text.

For example, technological innovation is a key focus for OPEC. It is why our Member Countries are investing heavily in hydrogen projects, CCUS, CCS and DAC facilities, and the circular carbon economy.

We need an all-peoples, all-technologies and all-energies approach. This is necessary due to demographic and macroeconomic trajectories for the decades ahead.

According to OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO), by 2045, the global population is expected to expand to about 9.5 billion and the global economy almost double. As a result of these changes, global primary energy demand is set to increase by 23% to 2045.

All forms of energy will be necessary to meet these demand needs. OPEC recognizes there will be an increased role for renewables. Hence, our Member Countries are investing heavily in them.

However, oil will retain the largest share in the energy mix and global oil demand is set to reach 116 million barrels per day (mb/d) by 2045. Africa, as a region set to develop and grow economically, is forecast to experience demand growth of 3.8 mb/d.

To meet these future needs and take into account the industry’s natural decline rates, investment requirements for the overall oil sector between 2022 and 2045 are estimated at a cumulative $14 trillion. If these investments do not materialize, it represents a considerable challenge and risk to market stability and energy security.

This underscores the fact that energy security and the need to reduce emissions must go hand-in-hand. Recent OPEC Secretariat research showed that in five years there would be an oil market deficit of 16 million barrels per day between forecasted rising global demand and supply if investments into upstream activities were stopped today — as some are calling for.

OPEC recognizes that oil market stability is a prerequisite for an investment enabling environment. This has been one of the primary motives of our market stabilization efforts together with 10 oil producing countries under the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. We are committed in 2024 to continue on the path we have set for ourselves, responding to market conditions and taking action as appropriate.

In doing so, we will count on Nigeria’s continued engagement to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

Hopefully, the points outlined have offered ‘food-for-thought’ for our discussions. In conclusion, if I may, I would like to pose some questions to the distinguished panel,

How do we ensure that the energy transition is “just, orderly and equitable,” especially from an African perspective, given that the continent contributes just 3.8% of global carbon emissions?

How do we strike the right balance between energy security, affordability and reducing emissions?

So without further ado, I would like to conclude my remarks and join the panel discussion.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/53-27-february-2024.html"
"2024-02-21","Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,

It is a pleasure to be back in Riyadh for the fourteenth edition of the IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.

I would like to begin by thanking His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia, for his warm welcome and valuable insights.

Your Royal Highness, the producer-consumer dialogue that you have championed throughout your career remains of paramount importance. It is central in helping to enable a sustainable energy future for all.

In addition, I would like to thank IEF Secretary General Joseph McMonigle and his team for hosting this year’s symposium, which offers a timely opportunity to engage in crucial dialogue on energy security, technology, outlooks and the market.

Allow me also to extend warm greetings to our co-host, Mr. Keisuke Sadamori, Director, Energy Markets and Security Division at IEA, and to all esteemed ministers, guest speakers, and contributors.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Since we met last year, the global economy has continued to face numerous challenges, including restrictive monetary policies, labour market constraints, and some geopolitical headwinds.

Oil demand in 2023, however, proved resilient with global growth of 2.5 million barrels a day (mb/d), and non-OPEC liquids supply growth at 2.4 mb/d.

The volatile environment we have witnessed requires constant vigilance and prudent policymaking from both producers and consumers alike, such as that seen through the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries.

It also underlines the importance of maintaining the cooperative spirit of the Cancun Ministerial Declaration, especially in terms of fostering mutual understanding, promoting stable and transparent energy markets, and narrowing differences and understanding on global energy issues among energy producing, consuming and transit countries.

In this respect, researchers at the US Federal Reserve recently found – and I quote – that “OPEC communication effectively reduces oil price volatility and favors market stability… our analysis indicates that market participants assess OPEC communications as providing an important signal to the crude oil market.”

Moreover, it stresses that “fundamental factors related to supply and demand drive OPEC’s public signal.”

Moving forward, rest assured that OPEC will continue to foster stability in the oil market and adhere to the spirit of Cancun, all the while working for the benefit of producers, consumers, and the global economy.

Towards this end, impartial, data-based and fact-driven analysis remains essential in grounding policymaking in realistic thinking, and keeping politics and ideology out of decision making.

In this respect, the growing gap between different scenarios further elevates the need to engage in dialogue on energy outlooks, especially as today’s investments and planning will dictate the success – or lack thereof – of the world’s efforts to maintain energy security tomorrow.

Ministers,

There is a simplistic narrative often heard in which the oil industry and renewables are competitors in a zero sum game, where the success of one represents a mortal threat to the other. This is simply not the case, especially as – alongside renewables – hydrocarbons will be required well into the 21st Century for many reasons. In the interest of time, I would like to mention two of them.

Firstly, there are inextricable links between the petrochemical and oil industries, and the renewable industry. Wind turbines today cannot be mass-produced without fibreglass, resin, or plastic, for example, ensuring that calls to stop investing in hydrocarbons are as unconducive to developing renewables as they are to maintaining energy security.

Secondly, it is an inescapable fact that as the world economy grows and populations increase, and given the pressing need to ensure universal energy access, primary energy demand will rise. In OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook, energy demand increases by 23% through 2045.

This underscores the need for all energies, with renewables expected to witness the fastest growth rate, and oil retaining the largest share of the energy mix.

In this respect, technological innovation to reduce emissions will remain a core area of focus for OPEC, as epitomized by some 50 oil and gas producers – including many from OPEC Member Countries – joining the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter at COP28. In doing so, they pledged to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, end routine flaring by 2030, and curb methane emissions to near-zero by 2030.

With this, allow me to conclude by thanking our hosts once more. OPEC values its cooperation with the IEF and IEA, and desires strengthened producer-consumer dialogue moving forward. After all, we owe it to tomorrow’s generations to deliver accurate energy policymaking today.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/362-21-february-2024.html"
"2024-02-19","President El Sisi, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Sixty-five years ago, between 16 and 23 April 1959, an event took place in Cairo that would change the course of the history of the oil industry. On the margins of the first Arab Petroleum Congress, representatives from five developing countries, namely, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, met and agreed on what was known as the ‘Maadi Pact.’ This began the process that would lead to the foundation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Baghdad.

Six and a half decades later, it gives me pride to return to this great city and thank the Egyptian authorities for their contributions to making OPEC-Egypt relations a resounding success.

I would like to thank His Excellency Abdel Fattah El Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt. I commend the President for his considerable contributions to our industry, including his patronage of this event. We thank him for his support of OPEC.

I thank His Excellency Tarek El Molla, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, and the Ministry for supporting EGYPS and making it a leading event on the global energy calendar. We are very grateful that the Minister has been a very good friend to OPEC over the years.

OPEC and Egypt’s relationship extends far beyond the Maadi Pact. Egypt was also a pioneer non-OPEC producer in terms of its cooperation with OPEC. The country has shown foresight in reaching out to others. Egypt was one of the first observers to the OPEC Conference back in 1984; it contributed to oil market stabilization efforts in the late 1980s; and, Cairo hosted the 133rd (Extraordinary) Meeting of the Conference on the 10th of December 2004.

Since 2016, throughout the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process, whereby OPEC has worked in tandem with 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries to take collective action to help stabilize the market, Egypt has issued declaratory statements of support for this enterprise.

Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen,

The theme of this event is ""Driving Energy Transition, Security, and Decarbonisation."" This is timely as global events of the last few years have underscored how important the issue of energy security is. Finding the right balance between policies that reduce emissions while ensure energy remains accessible is on ongoing challenge, that requires careful calibration.

It was for this reason that the ‘Global Stocktake’ from COP28 in Dubai called for a transition that was “just, orderly and equitable.”

The complexity of the challenge means that is no ‘one-size fits all’ solution to climate change; there are legitimate political trade-offs that need to be considered. This includes meeting Goal 7 of the UN’s Sustainable Development Agenda, namely, ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. We should never forget the 675 million people worldwide without access to electricity or the 2.3 billion who are still cooking with unsafe and polluting fuels.

A key enabler for energy security is ensuring adequate investments in the oil industry across all timeframes. Investment requirements in oil industry amount to $14 trillion between now and 2045. Oil market stability is a prerequisite for attracting such levels of investment. This has been a motivation behind OPEC’s actions, along with 10 non-OPEC producing countries, under the umbrella of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation.’

I would like to conclude by emphasising one other factor that is crucial for an orderly energy transition: dialogue. At OPEC, we have an open door policy, a host of bilateral and multilateral dialogues, and we do not dismiss any possible options in addressing climate change. We engage with all options.

This spirit of dialogue and openness is clearly on display here at Egypt Energy Show. With this, I wish all of us a successful Show.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/234-19-february-2024.html"
"2024-02-06","Your Excellency, the Honourable Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, global oil and gas leaders,

Namaste.

It is once again a great honour to address you today.

OPEC places great importance on its relationship with India, epitomized most recently by the successful 6th High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue that took place in Vienna at the end of last year.

Honourable Prime Minister Modi, we truly value your backing and guidance for our strategic cooperation, as well as the support provided by your Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, His Excellency Hardeep Singh Puri.

We believe the strategic relationship between India and OPEC continues to go from strength to strength.

It is a two-way energy security and economic relationship. OPEC supplies around 65% of India’s crude oil imports today, with the level expected to rise further in the coming decades, and our Member Countries are forging ever-closer bilateral investment ties with India and Indian oil and gas companies.

I would also like to take this opportunity to commend India’s work and leadership through the G20 Presidency in 2023. The inclusive approach and the Presidency’s understanding of the importance of listening to all voices should be highly praised.

This was clear when it came to energy issues, with a balanced, realistic and pragmatic approach when looking at the question: how can the world can deliver on energy security, energy access and affordability and reducing emissions?

The Indian government has said consistently that the future will require an all-energies approach. It is a message OPEC fully supports.

We also need an all-peoples approach. The capacities, national circumstances, and development priorities of all countries must be taken into account to ensure that no one is left behind.

And, we need an all-technologies approach. The world needs to develop and finance all forms of technologies to help reduce emissions and meet energy demand.

There are multiple energy transition pathways.

India has been a pioneer in embracing a variety of solutions that have helped bring energy access to millions that had previously been without. In this regard, I would like to congratulate the Honorable Prime Minister Modi and his government for the remarkable accomplishments in expanding energy access.

Your Excellency,

What a sustainable energy future needs more than anything is investment. For oil alone, we see investment requirements totaling $14 trillion, or around $610 billion on average per year out to 2045.

It is vital that all stakeholders understand the need for investments in all energies and all technologies, and with an appreciation of the needs of all peoples.

Looking ahead, I firmly believe that OPEC and India can work together to face the challenges and opportunities of building a sustainable energy future that leaves no-one behind.

Long may our relationship, and I hope I can say, partnership, continue to flourish.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/361-6-february-2024.html"
"2023-12-13","Excellency, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

On behalf of OPEC and our delegation here today, let me begin by thanking our colleagues here at the GECF headquarters in Doha for hosting this 4th high-level meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue.

Your Excellency, I want to thank you for your warm welcome and for your continued support of this important Dialogue, which continues to move from strength to strength.

I assure you that OPEC remains fully committed to this cooperation with the GECF, and it will remain a key component within our framework of our ongoing global energy dialogues.

I believe that open and transparent dialogue and cooperation with our industry partners is a win-win proposition as together we seek to address the complexities of the rapidly changing energy markets.

In this regard, both OPEC and GECF face similar challenges going forward.

Firstly, both organizations are tasked with meeting the world’s rapidly growing demand for oil and gas.

With rapidly expanding populations and growing economies, we expect to see global energy demand rise by 23% from now until 2045. This demand will be driven by the non-OECD region, with approximately 28% of it coming from India alone.

And, despite the naysayers who ruminate about imminent peak demand for oil and gas, the fact is that oil and gas are still forecast to make up over 50% of the world’s energy mix in the period to 2045.

To meet this future demand, we estimate that oil sector investment requirements from now until 2045 will amount to roughly $14 trillion.

Both of our organizations must work together along with other key industry stakeholders to help promote investment-friendly policies. The fact is, without adequate levels of investment, the future of our industry is in jeopardy.

Part of this effort entails controlling the narrative on energy transitions and, when necessary, correcting misguided messages related to fossil fuels and our industry.

In this regard, we have just returned from COP28, which was hosted by the UAE in Dubai.

OPEC and its Member Countries were well-represented at the event, and OPEC hosted an impressive pavilion.

Our main message at the climate talks was that we need a balanced, inclusive and realistic approach to addressing climate change.

Our industry has always been an important technology innovator, and it will continue to have a key role to play in any energy transition.

And finally, another theme that was discussed in Dubai and which is in the interest of both of our organizations and Member Countries is energy poverty.

Although progress has been made in narrowing the disparities between OECD and non-OECD regions, there is still much work to be done.

Our goal is to ensure affordable and sustainable access to energy for all people. No one should be left behind in any energy transition.

These are all global challenges, and they all warrant a global response.

There must be a united front among all industry stakeholders to make inroads in addressing these concerns.

Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

Each year, this Dialogue gives us a valuable opportunity to strengthen our cooperation through the sharing of best practices related to forecasting, analysis and modelling.

Today will be no exception as our colleagues bring us up to date on the short, medium and long-term oil and gas outlooks.

I look forward to a fruitful meeting today as we build upon the progress made at our last three meetings.

Thus, with no further ado, I would like to turn the floor back over to our esteemed hosts.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/385-13-december-2023.html"
"2023-12-09","Mister President, distinguished delegates,

It is a great honour to deliver these remarks in an OPEC Member Country, the UAE.

Holding COP28 here underscores the UAE’s role as a climate leader, and its capabilities in the realm of providing energy.

The interwoven nature of reducing emissions and energy security is now ‘rightfully’ at the forefront of global discussions about energy transition pathways. For this:

We need an all-energies approach.

Otherwise, the world cannot meet rising energy demand, maintain energy security and ensure affordable universal energy access.

The Paris Agreement also focuses on reducing emissions, rather than choosing certain energy sources.

We need an all-peoples approach.

The capacities, national circumstances, and development priorities of all countries must be taken into account to ensure that no one is left behind.

And, we need an all-technologies approach.

The world needs to develop and finance all forms of technologies to help reduce emissions while meeting demand.

Technological innovation is a key focus for OPEC. It is why our Member Countries are investing heavily in hydrogen projects, CCUS, CCS and DAC facilities, the circular carbon economy, and renewables.

I hope that you have visited the OPEC Pavilion here at COP28 to see this firsthand.

The oil industry is also taking a proactive approach here at COP28, with 50 oil companies representing nearly half of global production, including many from OPEC Member Countries, pledging to reach near-zero methane emissions and end routine flaring in their operations by 2030.

Ultimately, this ‘all-energies, all-peoples and all-technologies’ approach needs to adhere to the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.

This means ensuring:

That the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement concludes with equitable and inclusive outcomes;

That developed countries fulfil their long overdue climate finance commitments;

And that funding arrangements for loss and damage enable adequate and accessible financing that does not increase liabilities.

There is no single solution or path to achieve a sustainable energy future.

We need nuanced and realistic approaches to tackle emissions; ones that also enable economic growth, help eradicate energy poverty, and increase resilience at the same time.

In this respect, I wish COP28 every success in going down in history as a ‘COP of Unity, Action and Delivery’.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/1-09-december-2023.html"
"2023-11-09","Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

On behalf of OPEC, allow me to warmly welcome His Excellency, Hardeep Singh Puri, the Honourable Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Housing and Urban Affairs, and his team to the 6th High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue.

A lot has changed since our last high-level dialogue took place via teleconference in October 2021, but one constant has been that OPEC’s relationship with India has continued to go from strength to strength.

Earlier this year, our excellent cooperation was underscored during my two fruitful visits to India, where I participated at India Energy Week in February and at the G20 Energy Ministerial Meeting in July in Goa, with India providing an inclusive and effective G20 Presidency in 2023.

In addition, I was extremely pleased to meet Minister Puri at ADIPEC 2023 last month and on the sidelines of both the G20 Energy Ministerial Meeting in July and India Energy Week in February. Building on these excellent opportunities for dialogue, His Excellency and I also discussed a number of issues this morning.

Later today, I look forward to similarly constructive discussions at this meeting, as we look to foster oil market stability and future OPEC-India cooperation.

The excellent state of the OPEC-India dialogue also extends to the development of positive relationships between OPEC, its Member Countries and major Indian oil companies.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The year 2023 was an exciting one for India, with the country inspiring the world to reach new heights in a number of fields – aptly symbolized by the remarkable Chandrayaan-3 moon landing.

India’s heading of the G20 was similarly impressive, with India’s able leadership steering this year’s G20 discussions to a successful outcome, including on key energy issues. Indeed, upon reading the G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration, it is hard not to agree with the emphasis placed on “the importance of maintaining uninterrupted flows of energy… [and] exploring paths of enhanced energy security and market stability, including through inclusive investments to meet growing energy demand”.

Investments in energy capacity and technologies are more vital than ever, with necessary oil sector investment requirements out to 2045 alone totalling $14 trillion – or around $610 billion on average per year – if the world is serious about maintaining energy security and market stability, and reducing emissions.

Energy action is also acutely necessary, with global efforts to meet SDG 7 targets on affordable and clean energy lagging. About 675 million people remain without access to electricity, while 2.3 billion still lack access to clean cooking solutions.

It is clear that meeting the sizable challenges before us will require the type of sound governance and ambition regularly displayed by His Excellency, the Honourable Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Modi called on India’s citizens to make the 21st century the ‘century of India’. This is certainly conceivable, especially when considering that India’s GDP expanded by a staggering 70% over the past decade.

Over the next five years, the IMF sees India as one of the fastest growing top-20 economies; similarly, OPEC’s 2023 World Oil Outlook, or WOO, sees India’s growth averaging 6.1% in the period to 2028, with the country’s economy benefiting from population growth, a rising middle class and major infrastructural projects.

The long-term growth average to 2045 is also 6.1% per annum, which points to India being an ever-stronger global economic powerhouse.

By 2045, India’s economy is expected to nearly quadruple in size, adding about $29 trillion to its economy. Correspondingly, India’s energy consumption will also clearly rise.

The WOO forecasts that India will be the single largest contributor to energy demand growth over the period from 2022 to 2045, with incremental demand of 19.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d). Remarkably, the expansion in India’s energy demand will account for around 28% of global energy demand growth by 2045.

As the Indian government has said constantly, this will require all forms of energy. It is a message that OPEC supports too, as the world looks to meet future energy requirements.

From the perspective of oil, India’s demand alone is set to rise steeply from 5.1 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2022 to 11.7 mb/d by 2045. It will be the country with the largest oil demand growth over this period.

It is also important to note that OPEC Member Countries today provide approximately 60% of India’s total crude oil imports, and the significance of this trade relationship will continue to be vital in the years and decades ahead.

Excellency, Ladies and gentlemen,

It is evident that honourable Prime Minister Modi has astutely taken a middle-of-the-road track that underscores his commitment to mitigating climate change while supporting national interests and meeting energy demand. India’s broad diversification of its energy policy will help facilitate enhanced energy security going forward.

In this respect, the relationship between India and OPEC will be pivotal in the years to come, as the world seeks to foster global energy security, deliver energy affordability and reduce emissions.

By working together and embracing the underlying values of dialogue, cooperation and unity that underpin the Sanskrit phrase “vasudhaiva kutumbakam” – which means “the world is one family” – OPEC and India can, and will, meet the challenge of building a sustainable energy future that leaves no-one behind.

On this note, and without further ado, I would like to pass the floor to His Excellency, honourable Minister Puri.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/384-9-november-2023.html"
"2023-11-07","Ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

It is always a pleasure to be back in London, a city that I called home for a number of years when working for the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.

It is also a great pleasure to accept the invitation from my good friend, Adrian Binks, the Chairman and CEO of Argus Media, to deliver this keynote address at today’s conference.

The last time I attended this event was at least ten years ago in Geneva.

I know that many of you in the audience today will be traders, financial market participants, analysts, all of whom certainly follow developments of OPEC and OPEC+ affairs on a regular basis.

I am sure many of you will want to ask about the upcoming OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting later this month, so I thought I would bring it up first.

I would like to start by saying that we are fully open and transparent, and recognize how important short-term stability is for the long-term future of this vital global industry.

All I can say for now is that we continue to monitor supply and demand fundamentals on a daily basis and ministers will review all of this when they meet in Vienna at the end of this month.

In this respect, I would like to highlight that OPEC has a long history of supporting market stability, with the past few years being particularly extraordinary when looking back to the period since early 2020.

We all recall that in April of that year, OPEC and their non-OPEC partners came together to deliver unprecedented production adjustments aimed at rescuing the global oil market from the impacts of the pandemic.

The pivotal decisions taken eventually helped restore balance and a more sustainable stability to the market, and what we continue to do today remains fully focused on these key objectives.

Throughout 2023, OPEC+ has taken a proactive and pre-emptive approach to achieve and sustain a stable oil market, and to provide long-term guidance for the market.

This has been through the production adjustments under the umbrella of the Declaration of Cooperation, and through further voluntary adjustments from certain countries, most notably Saudi Arabia’s additional voluntary adjustment of 1 million barrels a day and Russia’s 300,000 barrels a day from exports, now in place until the end of this year.

The actions of OPEC and OPEC+ today, are a platform to help enable the huge investments required in the decades to come for an industry that is so pivotal to our daily lives.

We take for granted widely available products like gasoline, diesel, heating oil, jet fuel, and a variety of end-use items.

People sometimes forget things like toothpaste, deodorant, soap, cameras, computers, car tyres, contact lenses, artificial limbs, antibiotics and many types of medicine are also derived from petroleum.

The world needs more crude oil and the products derived from it for energy and economic security, not less.

At the same time, as an industry we recognize the importance of continually advancing operational efficiencies and reducing emissions.

This past year or so has seen a significant shift from policymakers in recognizing this intertwined narrative.

Governments everywhere are reevaluating their sustainable energy pathways, taking into account the realities on the ground and the views of their citizens.

There has been pushback against the narrative that the world should see the end of oil and gas.

There is now a more nuanced understanding of the scale of the energy challenges as initial net-zero policies stutter, targets for other energies falter due to costs, and concerns rise about access to critical minerals.

Moreover, we are now seeing more focus on the capacities and national circumstances of all countries in the energy transitions agenda, not just a select few.

Here in the UK, for example, we saw the government announce new oil and gas production licenses in August, and we understand that new legislation to mandate new licensing rounds will be part of the King’s Speech later today.

The government has also scrapped a number of proposals and targets related to net-zero, and the UK Prime Minister has called for a more pragmatic, proportionate, and realistic approach.

Given these types of policy developments that are happening across the world, and the need to find sustainable future pathways for both energy security and reducing emissions, the research team at the OPEC Secretariat has reassessed in the World Oil Outlook 2023 just what each energy can deliver, with a focus on pragmatic and realistic options and solutions.

The data-driven approach now sees oil demand reaching 116 million barrels a day by 2045, around 6 mb/d higher than in the 2022 edition, and with the potential to be even higher.

Some may ask questions of this forecast, and that is their right, but allow me to add a few points of further context.

First: Energy demand is set to expand significantly in the decades ahead, by 23% to 2045 in our Outlook, as the global population expands, economies grow, and the world looks to alleviate energy poverty.

Second: This requires all energies; no single energy source can shoulder the heavy burden of meeting this expansion alone.

For example, we see global oil demand increasing by 17% to 2045, gas by 30% and renewables by more than 200%, albeit from a low base.

To be clear, OPEC Member Countries are embracing renewables.

From some, unfortunately, we still hear that oil demand will peak before the end of the decade, but let me share with you some further numbers.

In 2022 and 2023, global oil demand is set to have increased by almost 5 mb/d, and in 2024, we see further growth of 2.2 mb/d.

We acknowledge that these numbers are partly supported by a post-pandemic rebound, but what is clear is that oil demand continues to rise significantly.

In addition, in the period to 2030 alone, it is expected that another half a billion people will move into cities across the world as the global economy continues to expand.

Being in London, and to put this in an understandable context, this urbanization drive will require the addition of approximately 50 new Londons.

Let us just pause for a second, and imagine how much energy that requires.

It is clear we cannot replace an energy system overnight, or even in two-to-three decades. We should remember that 30 years ago fossil fuels made up over 80% of the energy mix, and this remains the same today.

At OPEC, we believe the world has to focus on the task of reducing emissions, not choosing energy sources.

This can be achieved through technologies such as carbon capture utilization and storage, direct air capture, carbon dioxide removal and clean hydrogen.

It is important to act with determination to ensure that emissions are reduced and people have access to the energy products and services they require to live a comfortable life. These twin challenges should not be odds with each other.

This understanding is vital for future investments, with calls to stop investments in new oil projects misguided. If the necessary investments are not made, it will lead to energy chaos, not energy transitions.

For the oil industry alone, investment requirements out to 2045 total $14 trillion, or around $610 billion per year. It is vital that these are made; it is beneficial for both producers and consumers, and ultimately the wider global economy.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We believe that the future needs to see energy transitions that focus on an inclusive ‘all-peoples, all-fuels and all-technologies’ approach.

Energy transitions that enable economic growth, enhance social mobility, boost energy access, and reduce emissions at the same time.

This will be our message at COP28 that begins later this month in OPEC Member Country, the UAE, where we will have an OPEC pavilion for the first time.

At the OPEC pavilion, we will showcase how our Member Countries are responsible oil producers, investing to provide the world with energy security and investing to decarbonize and reduce emissions.

I invite all of you in the audience today to visit the OPEC pavilion if you plan to be at COP28 in Dubai.

At OPEC, we also recognize how all timeframes are inherently interlinked. What happens today, or what is decided tomorrow, has a direct bearing on our long-term energy future.

It is why OPEC and OPEC+ continue to support balanced and stable markets as a platform for investments and just and inclusive energy transitions.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/383-7-november-2023.html"
"2023-10-24","Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

I regret that my schedule did not allow me to attend OTC Brasil 2023 in person, but I am grateful to have the opportunity to address you today.

It was a tremendous privilege to spend the past week in the beautiful, vibrant and dynamic country of Brazil. In a first formal visit by an OPEC Secretary General, I was truly made to feel welcome in a country where I spent a number of my formative years.

It was a great honour to meet with His Excellency Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, President of the Federative Republic of Brazil, at the Alvorada Palace, as well as other government representatives.

It was also a pleasure to meet with many oil industry representatives, including my good friend, Jean Paul Prates, the CEO of Petrobras, and spend time meeting other stakeholders at the Brazilian Petroleum and Gas Institute, the organizer of this conference.

What was clear to me over the week was the importance of Brazil’s oil industry to the country, and more broadly, to the wider world.

Today, Brazil produces around 4.3 million barrels a day (mb/d) of liquids, the highest level ever recorded, making it the seventh largest global liquids producer.

It also has the largest recoverable ultra-deep oil reserves in the world, and I am sure many of those in the audience today have played crucial roles in the huge production expansion seen in the country’s offshore pre-salt basins.

I have no doubt that Brazil will continue to be at the forefront of the global oil industry in the decades ahead to help meet the expanding need for energy.

Our recently released World Oil Outlook 2023 sees energy demand increasing by 23% to 2045 with world population increasing to 9.5 billion and the global economy almost doubling to 2045. There also remains a critical need to bring modern energy services to those billions who continue to go without.

What is clear is that no credible way to address the challenges of energy security and reducing emissions without utilizing all available energy sources, all relevant technologies, and with energy market stability as a cornerstone for the huge investments required.

For the oil industry alone, we see oil demand reaching 116 mb/d in 2045, which is more than 6 mb/d higher than our forecast last year given significant energy policy and economic-related developments. I also want to underline that this has the potential to be even higher.

To meet this demand, oil sector investment requirements out to 2045 total $14 trillion, or around $610 billion per year. It is vital for both producers and consumers that these investments are forthcoming.

While providing more energy to the world, we also understand the need to continually reduce emissions, and subscribe to global best practices and cutting edge, best-in-class technologies, such as carbon capture utilization and storage, direct air capture, carbon dioxide removal, and many others. As the world is evolving, OPEC is too.

In this regard, I believe our industry should be proud of what it has achieved in terms of ensuring global energy security and reducing emissions across the board, and keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

I can recall the sceptics who said that technologies could not be developed to tap into Brazil’s pre-salt basins. They were proven wrong.

I have no doubt the sceptics who say that technologies are immature, or not achievable, to reduce emissions from oil, will be proven wrong too.

Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

We need to make sure the voice of our industry is heard; we need to highlight our successes; and we need to focus on delivering an all-energies, all- technologies, and all-peoples approach to energy transitions.

With that, I wish everyone a successful conference.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/382-24-october-2023.html"
"2023-10-16","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I regret that my schedule did not allow me to travel to African Energy Week 2023, but I am grateful to have the opportunity to address you today from the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna.

I commend the relevance of the overall theme of this year’s event, ‘The African Renaissance: Prioritizing Energy Poverty, People, Planet, Industrialization and Free Markets.’ It captures many of the key issues of our times.

The term “renaissance” refers to a rebirth, a revival of cultures, peoples and economies. Today, Africa’s peoples and sovereign nations are drawing inspiration from what they want their own futures to look like and working hard to make this a reality.

Africa’s future looks very bright in this respect; it will have the world’s largest working-age population by 2040 and has an estimated 120 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, 18 trillion standard cubic metres of natural gas and many other resources to help propel it forward.

To realize this potential, policymakers must realize that every nation has its own energy transition pathway to a sustainable energy future. In this regard, at COP 28 later this year, global policymakers should pay equal attention to energy security, energy affordability and reducing emissions.

With these issues in mind, and as this is African Energy week, I would like to highlight five points that I hope will provide you with food for thought in your discussions.

First, financing institutions should ensure that adequate financial investments, policies and regulations are available for the entire energy mix. Unfortunately, stringent borrowing requirements – often under the guise of ESG criteria – are limiting capital for hydrocarbon projects. This is slowing Africa’s ability to develop using its own natural resources.

In addition, the global oil sector will require cumulative investment of around $12 trillion through to 2045 to continue meeting demand and delivering energy security. Ignoring the reality that recent annual investment levels have been well below this figure poses a grave risk to energy security and needs to be remedied.

Second, the world must ensure just and inclusive energy transitions that reflect the needs, capabilities and stages of development of all sovereign nations.

In a world in which Heathrow Airport consumes more energy than Sierra Leone – or in which two-thirds of all primary schools in Sub-Saharan Africa have no access to electricity – the same environmental yardstick should not be used to compare regions at vastly different stages of development. Instead, our goal should be an inclusive, equitable approach in which no country is overburdened beyond its capabilities.

Third, policymakers must plan for our energy future based on facts and reality. Population growth, energy demand and urbanization will rise greatly in Africa and other regions. Globally, OPEC sees primary energy demand expanding by over 20% between now and 2045 and oil demand increasing to around 110 million barrels per day in 2045. Africa is expected to see oil demand increase by close to 80% over this period.

It is clear that all energy sources, all relevant technologies, and unprecedented investment, collaboration and support are required.

Fourth, moving forward, we need to strike a balance between delivering the affordable energy products and services that people require to live a comfortable life, and reducing emissions.

In this respect, technological innovation is a key focus for OPEC. To ensure a sustainable future, many of our Member Countries are already investing heavily, in hydrogen projects, carbon capture utilization and storage facilities, and the circular carbon economy.

More countries across Africa will be able to do the same if properly allowed to utilize their natural resources to generate revenues. Global climate challenges should be addressed fairly, especially as Africa contributes around 3 per cent to global annual greenhouse gas emissions, the smallest share of any continent.

Fifth, utilizing Africa’s natural resources like oil and gas will help deliver energy affordability and alleviate energy poverty. This is vital on a continent where hundreds of millions of people still lack access to electricity, and around a billion still rely on inefficient and polluting cooking systems.

Everyone must understand that energy transitions mean something very different for those with very basic energy needs. Delivering universal energy access must be a priority.

Ultimately, as the old African saying goes, “tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today.” There is great wisdom in these words, and it is up to today’s policymakers to ensure that tomorrow’s global energy industry – including in Africa – is advanced enough to eliminate energy poverty, prioritize people, protect the planet, meet future energy demands and drive socio-economic development.

With that, I would like to thank the event organizers for the opportunity to address you today, and wish you all fruitful discussions.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/381-16-october-2023.html"
"2023-10-10","Your Highness, Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great privilege to be here in Fujairah for the 11th Energy Markets Forum, held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi, Member of the UAE Supreme Council and the Ruler of Fujairah.

It is also an honour to have in attendance today, His Highness Sheikh Saleh Al Sharqi, Chairman of the Port of Fujairah.

I would like to thank you for the warmth and tremendous hospitality my colleagues and I have enjoyed since arriving in Fujairah.

I would also like to thank Sean Evers and his team at Gulf Intelligence for helping put together this important gathering.

Your Highness, Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

As we approach COP28 later this year in the UAE, I think the overall theme of this forum, ‘Navigating the Age of Energy Security: Opportunities & Challenges?’ offers up an extremely important perspective.

The issue of energy security goes to the core of OPEC’s founding commitment to support a stable and sustainable oil market, in the interest of energy security for producers, consumers and the global economy.

This has gained additional momentum over the past six years or so in working with other leading oil-producing countries through the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC). Together, we have been front-and-centre in helping reduce volatility and in supporting a balanced and stable global oil market.

The importance of energy security and market stability is not only vital for the short-term, it is critical for the long-term too.

This is clear when we look at energy transitions, and its intertwined issues of energy security, energy availability and the need to reduce emissions.

In this regard, it is vital we take a fact-based approach to deliver just, inclusive and realistic transitions and a sustainable energy future for all.

Some remain ideologically driven about our energy future. They dismiss certain energies and technologies as part of the past, not part of the future.

We see this narrative for oil, with some asserting that fossil fuel demand would peak before 2030, and in some net-zero targets and scenarios global demand drops to around 80 million barrels a day (mb/d) by 2030. This is more than 20 mb/d below today’s level, and 2030 is only six years from now!

Over the period to 2030, however, it is expected that another half a billion people will move into cities across the world as the global economy continues to expand, and there remains a critical need to bring modern energy services to those billions that continue to go without basic energy access in many parts of the world.

This requires more energy, and as our recently published World Oil Outlook 2023 shows, global energy demand is set to expand by 23% in the longer period to 2045.

Your Highness, Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

There is no credible way to address this without utilizing all available energy sources.

Yes, renewables will have to play a much greater role. OPEC Member Countries are already investing significantly in this area. The UAE, in particular, is well-known as a global leader in this field.

Gas, hydro, nuclear, hydrogen and biomass will also expand, BUT there is no doubt that oil will remain integral. In fact, by 2045, oil is still expected to meet almost 30 per cent of the global energy mix.

Recent energy and economic-related developments, as populations glimpse what many initial net zero policies and targets mean for them and policymakers reevaluate their approach to energy transition pathways, have seen the OPEC Secretariat reassess its outlook for oil demand.

In the WOO 2023, oil demand reaches 116 million barrels a day (mb/d) by 2045, around 6 mb/d higher than in the WOO 2022. There is also the potential for this level to be even higher, if societies and governments continue to push back on the over-zealous green and net-zero targets.

To meet this level of demand, investment requirements out to 2045 total $14 trillion, or around $610 billion on average per year. It is vital that these are made; it is beneficial for both producers and consumers.

Calls to stop investments in new oil projects are misguided and will only lead to energy and economic chaos.

From the perspective of reducing emissions, it is a taboo in some energy circles to suggest that the oil industry can reduce emissions. To those we say we are already doing so. One needs to look no further than here in the UAE.

The industry, with OPEC Member Countries playing an important role, are already investing heavily in hydrogen projects, carbon capture utilization and storage facilities, carbon dioxide removal, direct air capture and the circular carbon economy.

It is also important to remember that the Paris Agreement is about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of source. Energy transitions are not about moving from one fuel to another, but about lowering emissions from all sources.

As we look to COP28, OPEC is not dismissing any energy sources, technologies, or peoples, and believes that all stakeholders should do the same. We need to be honest about the realities on the ground, and avoid being ideological about the way forward. A sustainable energy and economic future has to focus on all energy sources, all relevant technologies, the views of all people, and deliver unparalleled investment, collaboration and support. We owe this to future generations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/380-10-october-2023.html"
"2023-10-09","Your Royal Highness, Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

It is a great pleasure for me personally, and the team here from the OPEC Secretariat, to present our flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook 2023, at the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC).

I would like to thank HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, Chairman of the Board of Trustees at KAPSARC for being here today, and for his earlier kind remarks.

His Royal Highness has played a leading role in the history of OPEC and has been a driving force in the success of the Declaration of Cooperation, particularly in helping the global oil market navigate its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Given the role of Saudi Arabia and His Royal Highness within OPEC, it is only appropriate that we launch the World Oil Outlook here in Riyadh.

The launch also coincides with MENA Climate Week 2023 in Riyadh, the first time it is held in the region. This event is testament to the proactive role that OPEC Member Countries are taking on climate related issues. This collaborative platform is a pivotal get together in the lead up to COP 28 that will be held in eight weeks in another of our Member Countries, the United Arab Emirates.

I would also like to thank Eng. Fahad Alajlan, President of KAPSARC, and his dedicated staff, for facilitating such an important OPEC event.

Launching our World Oil Outlook at such a renowned OPEC Member Country think tank as KAPSARC, is a great opportunity to underscore our commitment to fact-based analysis, knowledge-sharing, dialogue and data transparency.

Your Royal Highness, Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

This year’s Outlook is the 17th and I truly believe it is a landmark edition.

This year’s analysis examines the intertwined challenges related to energy security, energy availability and reducing emissions. It asks the questions of how we can deliver a sustainable energy and economic future for all, with world population increasing to 9.5 billion by 2045, the global economy almost doubling over the same period, and given the critical need to bring modern energy services to those billions that continue to go without.

Our research team has taken onboard all the shifting realities on the ground, what each energy source can actually deliver, what technological options are relevant and available, and most recently the changing policy dynamic and challenges around experimental net-zero policies.

Over the past year, what is clear is that we have seen population’s voice concerns about the costs and actual benefits of net-zero targets as policymakers alter their approach to energy transition pathways.

In many countries, we have also seen many renewable projects delayed or even shelved, due to rising costs and supply chain constraints. As policymakers realize, renewables alone cannot save the day, and over optimistic targets may lead to future energy shortfalls.

The pushback on net zero has also been seen in countries in the developing world that are only now beginning to have their voices heard. At the OPEC Seminar in July, many African nations spoke powerfully of the need for more energy, not less, to help alleviate energy poverty, and of the need to exploit their abundant resources, much of it oil and gas. I take this opportunity to thank YRH for advocating for the eradication of energy poverty for many years.

The capacities and national circumstances of all countries, including developing ones, must be taken into account to deliver just, inclusive and realistic transitions.

We firmly believe that climate action should not come at the cost of global energy security. In fact, we go further: energy security, accessibility and sustainability are essential for the world to combat climate change.

Your Royal Highness, Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

All this leads in only one direction – that is the world will need more energy, and all forms of energy.

The upshot is there is no credible way to address all the challenges before us without utilizing all available energy sources, all relevant technologies, with energy market stability as a cornerstone for the huge investments required.

OPEC does not dismiss any energy sources or technologies, and believes that all stakeholders should do the same and recognize short- and long-term energy realities.

Accordingly, this year’s Outlook sees oil demand in 2045 at 116 million barrels a day (mb/d), more than 6 mb/d higher than our forecast last year, and with the potential to be even higher.

For this to be achieved, oil sector investment requirements out to 2045 now total $14 trillion, or around $610 billion per year.

There are some who unfortunately continue to push the extremely risky narrative of dismissing oil with talk of oil demand dropping by almost 25 mb/d by 2030, only just over six years from now, and with dangerous calls to stop investments in new oil projects.

This can only lead to heightened volatility, hindering economic development and exacerbating energy poverty.

The WOO takes a holistic view of the core energy challenges before us. We need to reduce emissions, and remember that the Paris Agreement itself is about reducing emissions, not about choosing energy sources. We need to guarantee energy security. We need to ensure everyone has access to modern energy services.

It is evident that the past year’s events have given us a refocus as we now look to work together with partners across the world to build momentum towards the first ever global stocktake, and examine our progress towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement’s key objectives.

All stakeholders need to be more realistic about the facts on the ground, and we should all be working towards achieving the sustainable development goals by utilizing a diverse mix of energy sources, and while continuing to ensure energy security across the world.

Before I finish, allow me YRH to take this opportunity to thank the WOO team at the Secretariat. Year-on-year, they continue to push the boundaries of our research, to provide more depth and insight that can stimulate both debate and action.

With that, my colleagues will provide you with a more in-depth insight into some of the main highlights and takeaways of this year’s publication.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/379-9-october-2023.html"
"2023-10-03","Ladies and gentlemen,

OPEC is extremely pleased to host this morning’s leadership roundtable at ADIPEC to share perspectives on how national oil companies (NOCs) can – and are – contributing to a lower emissions global energy system.

Seeing the broad array of expertise before me, I am confident that we will have an excellent discussion on what is a timely topic ahead of COP 28 commencing on November 30 in Dubai.

NOCs are contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions while providing the energy security and affordability that the world needs.

In this respect, I would like to highlight four areas of focus that have been key in driving NOCs’ success to date, namely: developing advanced technologies; ensuring adequate investment in all energies; improving operational efficiency; and facilitating cooperation within the industry.

Firstly, technological advancements and innovations can and do improve performance across the entire oil industry value chain. OPEC Member Countries and NOCs are fully aware of this and are developing advanced technology and driving technological innovation accordingly. The thousands of patents granted to the oil industry each year underline this fact, with Saudi Aramco granted 966 patents in 2022, for example.

NOCs are working hard to harness the advanced skills and knowledge at their disposal to implement low-emissions solutions and mobilize state-of-the-art cleaner technologies, including, but not limited to, scaling up carbon capture utilization and storage, clean hydrogen technologies, direct air capture, and carbon dioxide removal, all within the concept of the circular carbon economy.

As we are in the UAE this morning, I would like to mention the impressive efforts of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company in this respect.

ADNOC is piloting cutting-edge carbon removal technology that will capture CO2 from the air, combine it with seawater, and inject it deep underground, where it is turned into rock.

This represents the region’s first carbon negative project, and ADNOC believes that this technology has the potential to eliminate billions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere.

ADNOC is also exploring the construction of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) hubs in the UAE, and has already begun construction on the Middle East’s first high-speed hydrogen refueling station.

Elsewhere, in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco has set the bar in cutting emissions high with a carbon-capture target of 44 million tonnes per year by 2035. Its efforts to develop effective CO2 capture and sequestration techniques will see the Kingdom create one of the largest CCUS hubs in the world in the Jubail Industrial City, and reduce emissions across the hydrocarbon chain.

In Africa, Algeria’s Hydrogen Development Roadmap – published in March 2023 – aims to make Algeria a pioneer at the regional and international level in the production and commercialization of this energy by producing between 30 and 40 billion KW of hydrogen by 2040 at a very competitive price. Suffice to say, OPEC Member Countries know what needs to be done.

Some suggest that a number of these technologies are immature, while ignoring that many technologies referenced in the IEA’s net-zero scenarios are at an immature, experimental or even theoretical stage. Indeed, some unfortunately believe that renewables alone – without oil and gas – represent the only solution to the challenges posed by climate change.

This is unrealistic, as acknowledged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which sees CCS and DAC playing a key role in mitigating climate change moving forward.

Secondly, OPEC Member Countries and NOCs firmly believe that if the world is to avoid volatility and meet future energy demand, we need to ensure the availability of adequate investment in all energies today.

Backing up their words with actions, OPEC Member Countries and their NOCs are proving that it is possible to invest simultaneously, among other areas, in upstream and downstream capacity, hydrogen, new decarbonization technologies and hydrocarbons. Being in the UAE this morning, we need not look far for inspiration in this respect.

ADNOC has allocated $15 billion for new energies and decarbonization technologies to reduce carbon intensity by 25% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. Simultaneously, it plans to expand oil production capacity to 5 mb/d by 2027. Ensuring adequate investment in all energies in this manner is a pragmatic approach worthy of emulation if the world is serious about maintaining energy stability while reducing emissions.

Thirdly, NOCs are constantly improving their operational efficiency by optimizing extraction and refining processes – including excellent reservoir management practices – flare minimization and reducing methane leaks, greenhouse gas emissions management, energy efficiency and improving transportation and logistics to minimize energy waste and emissions.

Decades of excellent operational practices, for example, have ensured that Saudi Aramco’s carbon intensity per barrel is ranked among the world’s least carbon intense sources of crude oil, and the company has concrete targets to reduce its upstream carbon intensity even further by 2035. Angola, Kuwait and the UAE also rank among the world’s least carbon intense per barrel.

Finally, with NOCs constantly seeking to improve their operational efficiency standards further, OPEC regularly facilitates exchanges of best practices and cooperation among NOCs and IOCs.

The 8th OPEC International Seminar in July, for example, brought together 1,000 delegates, including 18 CEOs of energy firms and 17 ministers from producing and consuming countries. It provided an excellent forum to share ideas and best practices, and OPEC will once again gather industry stakeholders together for a workshop later this month towards the same end.

In conclusion, I believe that NOCs should be proud of what they have been doing to date to foster global energy security, deliver energy affordability and reduce emissions – all integral components of the energy sustainability trilemma.

Ahead of COP28, I want to underline that focusing on one aspect of the trilemma, while neglecting the others, will lead to market volatilities, price shocks and energy shortages. I also wish to underline that the Paris Agreement is about countries working together to reduce emissions and strengthen commitments over time, and not about choosing energy sources.

Indeed, with the world poised to continue requiring the energy stability and availability that oil has provided for decades, I have no doubt that NOCs will continue to achieve milestones in reducing emissions by developing advanced technologies, investing in all energies, improving operational efficiency, and facilitating cooperation within the industry.

Towards ensuring stability across the global energy system, and making progress on achieving a lower carbon future, OPEC will be there to support them at every step of the way.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/378-3-october-2023.html"
"2023-09-05","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to begin by thanking His Excellency, Zhang Jianhua, Administrator of the National Energy Administration of the People’s Republic of China, for the invitation to address the 2023 International Forum on Energy Transition.

His Excellency Jianhua is a good friend of OPEC and the National Energy Administration is a key partner in the excellent cooperation OPEC enjoys with China as part of the successful OPEC-China Energy Dialogue.

This was on display at the 6th High-level Meeting of the energy dialogue in May of this year, with His Excellency Jianhua underlining that OPEC and China remained important strategic partners who had achieved positive results in helping to jointly maintain global oil market stability.

The value of such stability feeds into the overall theme of this year’s forum, ‘Jointly Promoting Energy Transition for a Shared Green Future.’

As sagely noted in the past by His Excellency, the Honourable President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, “we must strive to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind”. Towards this end, and ahead of COP 28 in OPEC Member Country, the United Arab Emirates, in November and December this year, global policymakers must work to foster just and inclusive energy transitions, maintain energy security and reduce emissions.

I use the term transitions in the plural, because our goal must be to reflect the needs, capabilities and stages of development of all sovereign nations and peoples. An inclusive, equitable approach in which no country is overburdened beyond its capabilities is vital.

What is evident from all data-based outlooks is that oil will remain key to enabling energy security, as populations expand, economies grow, and the world looks to alleviate the scourge of energy poverty.

In this regard, OPEC remains committed to delivering an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations to avoid volatility.

We should also remember that 30 years ago fossil fuels made up over 80% of the energy mix, and this remains the same today. We cannot replace an energy system overnight, or even in two-to-three decades. We have to work with what we have.

This means ensuring that rising energy demand and the issue of climate change are not at odds with each other.

To meet this demand and achieve the Paris Agreement goals, OPEC sees technological innovation as key. Our Member Countries are already investing heavily in hydrogen projects, carbon capture utilization and storage facilities, and the circular carbon economy.

The importance of working together is key, as underlined at the recent OPEC-China energy dialogue meeting. Here, we both expressed our commitment to our cooperation moving forward, particularly in the areas of information sharing, technological exchange and energy transitions.

With that, I would like to wish you all fruitful discussions.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/377-5-september-2023.html"
"2023-07-22","Your Excellency Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

At the outset, I would like to thank the Government of India for its hospitality and leadership of this important event at such a critical time, indeed, under a very appropriate theme of “One Earth, One Family, One Future.”

It is a great pleasure to be here in India and represent OPEC at the G20 Energy Ministerial Meeting. India is indeed a key strategic partner for OPEC and its Member Countries.

Your Excellency Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In the decades ahead, what is clear is that the world will need more energy, as populations expand and economies grow. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook, global energy demand will rise by 23% between now and 2045.

Meeting this growth, ensuring energy security and affordable access, while also lowering global emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, requires all energies, technologies, and unprecedented investment and collaboration.

The oil industry alone requires global investments of 12.1 trillion $ between now and 2045. However, there have been increasing calls over the past few years to end financing of oil projects.

OPEC believes this is neither pragmatic nor constructive for the way forward. Following this path will severely affect economies, constrain social mobility, limit affordable energy access and exacerbate energy poverty.

At OPEC we believe that policymakers and industry stakeholders need to work together to ensure a long-term investment-friendly climate for all energies. One that works for producers and consumers, as well as developed and developing countries.

A key message from the recent 8th OPEC International Seminar was that energy security for all and decarbonization must go hand-in-hand.

Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to state unequivocally that OPEC Member Countries are ready, willing and able to play a key role in providing energy to the world and reducing emissions.

Our Member Countries continue to invest in upstream and downstream capacity. They are also mobilizing cleaner technologies to decarbonize the industry.

At the same time, they are making major investments in renewables and hydrogen capacity, carbon capture utilization and storage and other technol­ogies, as well as promoting the Circular Carbon Economy.

Your Excellency Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

OPEC believes the future needs to see investments and finance in energy transitions that focus on an inclusive ‘all-peoples, all-fuels and all-technologies’ approach.

There is clearly no one-size-fits-all solution to a sustainable energy future.

In the spirit of our theme today “One Earth, One Family, One Future,” OPEC looks forward to working closely with the G20 to promote sustainable energy future for the world.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/2-22-july-2023.html"
"2023-07-11","Excellences, distinguished delegates, esteemed colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the official launch of the 2023 Annual Statistical Bulletin.

Allow me to express my sincere gratitude to our co-sponsor of this event, the WU Executive Academy, which is affiliated with the Vienna University of Economics and Business. The Academy is represented with us today by Dr. Jakob Müllner, Associate Professor and Academic Director at the WU Executive Academy.

This excellent education institution is providing valuable knowledge to the next generation of energy leaders through its Masters programme in Energy Management. We extend our heartfelt thanks for their sponsorship of today’s launch and look forward to continuing and intensifying this fruitful cooperation in the future.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The Annual Statistical Bulletin (or ASB in brief) is a publication that OPEC is highly proud of.

Now in its 58th edition, its significance and relevance has only grown since its inaugural release in 1965.

Comprising detailed and comprehensive time series data, the ASB offers key statistical information for all OPEC Member Countries, as well as worthwhile data related to Non-OPEC oil producing countries. Readers will also benefit from information covering exports, imports, production, refineries and shipping.

OPEC is dedicated to enhancing data transparency through broad dissemination of accurate and timely oil and gas data, not only for the ASB, but for all of our publications.

In order to maximize access to this publication, we continue to utilize a range of technologies. In addition to the traditional printed edition, we offer an electronic version as well as an interactive online version that present historical time-series data dating back to 1960. Furthermore, a SmartApp version for mobile devices allows users to access this effective data anytime, anywhere, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week and regardless of the location all over the world via internet services.

Ladies and gentlemen,

It remains OPEC’s firm belief that the data should assist and support in policy formation. A problem cannot be solved if it is not accurately diagnosed. Remedies cannot be offered unless there is a correct understanding of the situation.

This is particularly the case in the realm of energy transitions. Energy as a topic, so central to our daily lives, can often elicit strong opinions, which in some cases feed into policy formation.

Accurate data and impartial oil market analysis play a role in supporting solutions for today’s challenges alongside the policy making process. OPEC is focused on ensuring the quality and reliability of data research. The ASB is a vital component of OPEC fulfilling its mission and contributing to oil market stability, in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to take a moment to thank our colleagues at the Research Division, particularly the Data Services Department, for their formidable efforts in working with our Member Countries to develop this excellent publication. You have once again succeeded in producing a product of the highest standards, which will surely be of great benefit to industry stakeholders.

The Secretariat team has had a very intense program of events in the last few weeks, including the celebration of OPEC’s 60-year anniversary held in Baghdad, Iraq, the 8th OPEC International Seminar, held last week, and several other high profile meetings. That they can, concurrently, produce a document of the caliber of this ASB, with inputs and contributions from across the Secretariat, is testimony to their dedication and professionalism.

We will now have the opportunity to hear a presentation prepared for this event by the related department, after which we will screen a video highlighting the key findings of this year’s ASB. This will be followed by a panel discussion on the essential outcomes.

I thank you all for attending and I wish us a successful event launch.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/375-11-july-2023.html"
"2023-07-11","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

Although I am unfortunately not able to join you there in Abuja due to scheduling issues, it is my great pleasure to address this 22nd Nigeria Energy Week Strategic Conference via teleconference from here at the OPEC Secretariat. I look forward to my next visit to Nigeria, which is currently in the planning stages.

Firstly, on behalf of OPEC, allow me to recognize His Excellency Bola Ahmed Tinubu who was officially sworn in on Monday, May 29, 2023 as the new President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Excellency, as you undertake this extremely important role in leading Nigeria forward into the years ahead, rest assured that you have the full support of OPEC behind you. Indeed, we look forward to working closely with you and your esteemed leadership team, as together, we seek to continue promoting the path of stability and balance in the global energy markets.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Just about one week ago, we hosted the world’s top energy leaders in Vienna for the 8th OPEC International Seminar.

Under the very timely and relevant theme Towards a Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Transition, some of the industry’s leading experts had a chance to share their insights on topics that will shape the future of the global energy industry.

An event of this magnitude is a massive undertaking, and we would not have been able to achieve success without the highly valuable support of our loyal Member Countries. Nigeria is no exception to this rule, and I would like to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to the Government of Nigeria for its very generous support of the Seminar. Your contributions, along with those of our other Member Countries, have enabled us to organize an event that was at the highest caliber of professionalism.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Allow me to turn now to the theme of this event, which is “Powering Nigeria’s Sustainable Energy Future”. This is a theme that is both timely and appropriate, especially as the industry continues to seek the right balance between pursuing two top priorities: 1) meeting the world’s rising energy needs while also 2) addressing climate change.

One thing is certain, to achieve both well, we will need to see a fair, inclusive and equitable approach to ensure that we leave no one behind as we navigate the energy transitions to come.

This is of special importance to Nigeria and to Africa, a continent that is home to seven of OPEC’s 13 Member Countries.

We at OPEC will continue to work closely with our Member Countries to ensure that all voices are heard and all circumstances are considered in any negotiations or discussions related to climate change.

There is simply no one right path to solving this complex issue, but rather a series of solutions that are geared to meeting the diverse needs of citizens no matter where they may come from.

Dealing with these issues is nothing new for OPEC. In fact, as an Organization, we have a long history of supporting environmental issues and sustainable development.

We have been directly involved in discussions that led to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Starting back in 1990 with the UN Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee, these efforts have continued up until 2022 with COP27 in Sharm El-Sheikh.

And now, OPEC is proud that COP28 will be hosted later this year by our Member Country, the United Arab Emirates. This COP will provide unique opportunities to press for fair and equitable outcomes while also highlighting what our Member Countries are doing to help address climate change, including ongoing activities related to diversifying their energy resources.

According to our World Oil Outlook (WOO), global primary energy demand is forecast to increase by a significant 23% in the period to 2045, which means we will need all forms of energy. This includes solar, nuclear, wind and waste-to-energy power. We will also require innovative solutions such as carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen projects, in addition to the Circular Carbon Economy, which has received a positive endorsement from the G20.

The oil and gas industry has a long history of being at the cutting edge of innovation and technology, and now it has the possibility of bringing that expertise to bare on developing cleaner and more efficient technological solutions to help unlock an emissions-free future.

While there is great promise in many of these areas, there is also a grim reality shared by far too many around the world who have no access to energy at all.

According to the United Nations, for example, 733 million people do not have access to electricity. Furthermore, one third of the world’s population use dangerous or inefficient cooking systems, which causes a host of health-related problems.

This uneven world of energy haves and have-nots will require that capacities and national circumstances of developing countries be taken into account when considering actions related to climate change. Policy-makers must be keenly aware that even the best intentions can result in unintended consequences. And if policies are not well thought through, we could end up making things worse with the potential for heightened volatility, energy shortfalls or other unwanted outcomes.

One area of great concern I would like to highlight is related to industry investment. The global oil sector alone will need a massive cumulative investment of $12.1 trillion through to 2045. We are currently not on track to reaching that level, and, to make things worse, we have in recent years even heard calls from some to limit or stop funding for new oil and gas projects all together.

This is, of course, unwise and is an unrealistic scenario that would be particularly devastating to developing countries who rely on revenues from their precious oil and gas resources to develop their economies. Africa, for example, is blessed with an estimated 120 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 18 trillion standard cubic metres of natural gas.

However, significant investment will be required to fully realize the potential of these resources to benefit Africa’s citizens while also enabling the necessary mitigation actions needed to reduce the carbon footprint of the oil industry.

In some cases, financial institutions are either limiting and tightly controlling how money is invested into fossil fuels under environmental, social and governance (ESG) guidelines. This situation is hindering Africa’s progress despite the fact that Africa accounts for only around 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Moving forward, OPEC will continue to do its part in promoting a pro-investment environment by taking the actions necessary to encourage oil market stability under the Declaration of Cooperation.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In conclusion, allow me to say that, despite the significant challenges that lie ahead for Nigeria, for Africa and for OPEC, we are presented with just as many opportunities.

And, as history has proven time and again, the only way we will persevere through the hard times is by working together. The long-standing relationship between OPEC and Nigeria runs deep. Our tightly shared values go all the way back to 1971, when Nigeria joined OPEC. The contributions Nigeria has made to this Organization since that time are simply too many to list here today.

And now, as we look ahead, OPEC will continue to rely on Nigeria’s crucial support and cooperation as His Excellency, President Tinubu takes the country forward to help meet the needs of Nigerians now and in the future.

Thank you, and I wish you all a highly successful Conference.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/376-11-july-2023.html"
"2023-07-05","Your Royal Highness, Excellencies, distinguished ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great honour to welcome you to the 8th OPEC International Seminar. Organizing an event on this scale is obviously only possible with intense teamwork. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to making this Seminar a reality.

My deep gratitude goes to my colleagues at the OPEC Secretariat, who have worked tirelessly, night and day, to produce this Seminar. The outcome of your hard work is this outstanding programme we have ahead of us.

We are extremely grateful to Their Excellencies, the Ministers from our Member Countries and ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ Countries, who have taken time out of their busy schedules to join us again in Vienna.

Thanks also go to other Ministers, Ambassadors, dignitaries, our moderators, the heads of international organizations, the chief executives of national and international oil companies, and all the other speakers and panel members.

I would also like to thank our sponsors for their generosity. We are extremely grateful for their support in realizing the vision behind this Seminar. We cannot thank them enough and look forward to showcasing their support over the next two days.

Our location today, the Hofburg Palace, is a reminder of the unique relationship between OPEC and our host country, the Republic of Austria. Since OPEC established its headquarters here 58 years ago, we have enjoyed a special bond with the people and city of Vienna.

Our Organization is proud of its history. Just last month, we celebrated our 60th Anniversary in a moving ceremony at the site of our founding, the Al Shaab Hall in Baghdad, Iraq. Our Founder Fathers, who took such a courageous step in bringing this Organization into existence on the 14th September 1960, would surely be pleased to see OPEC thriving as it does today.

While we rightly take pride in our past; this is a seminar focused on the future – the future of our industry; the future of our planet.

This forward orientated outlook informs the theme of our Seminar, ‘Towards a Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Transition.’ ‘Sustainability’ and ‘inclusivity’ are terms repeated so often in public discourse, there is a risk that we lose sight of their fundamental meaning.

The concept of ‘sustainability’ is essentially about balance. It relates to how we fulfil the needs of current generations without compromising the needs of future generations; while ensuring a balance between the three pillars of sustainability: economic viability, environmental protections and social equity.

‘Inclusivity’ relates to ensuring all voices are heard in discussions on energy transitions; developing and developed countries; producers and consumers. It means adhering to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. It means there is no ‘one-size-fits all’ solution to the climate challenge, instead, there are multiple pathways to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement.

The theme of this Seminar looks to the future, and given that forward-facing orientation I am delighted that we are joined by the architects of our world’s future: young people and students from across the globe. We encourage you to maximize the opportunity that this Seminar presents.

I would like to conclude by emphasizing a crucial point that lies at the heart of our discussions at this Seminar: billions of people depend on our commodity, oil, for daily life. This inescapable reality warrants respect.

That is why OPEC pursues market stability.

Of course, as an industry, we want an emissions-free future. Harnessing technologies that can do this will be one of the predominant themes of this Seminar.

However, oil is too central and fundamental to life to just stop. If we recognize that reality, and constantly strive to reduce our environmental footprint, we can all move ‘Towards a Sustainable and Inclusive Energy Transition.’

Once again, my thanks to everybody involved today. OPEC is honoured to have you participate in this event.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/374-5-july-2023.html"
"2023-06-26","Honourable Prime Minister, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great privilege to be here in Kuala Lumpur this morning to listen to the Honourable Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

I would like to thank the Prime Minister for his wise words, and also for Malaysia’s continued support for the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, widely known as OPEC+.

Malaysia’s effective participation in the DoC since it was inaugurated at the end of 2016, has been instrumental in helping the oil industry overcome two historic downturns, most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.

At OPEC, we look forward to continuing to work with the government’s Head of Delegation to DoC meetings, His Excellency Mohammad Rafizi Bin Ramli, Malaysia’s Minister of Economy and his team in the coming months and years.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my good friend, Tan Sri Tengku Taufik, President & Group CEO of Petronas and Chairman of Energy Asia.

I recall meeting him earlier this year in Davos – and listening to his views on a host of topics, including the need for an inclusive and sustainable energy transition. He is an extremely eloquent advocate for the oil and gas industry.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Malaysia has a long and distinguished oil industry history, dating back to 1910. This was the year when the country’s first oil well was spudded on Bukit Telaga Minyak (Canada Hill) in Miri, Sarawak. It produced its first oil by the end of the year and continued producing for a further 62 years.

Known as the ‘Grand Old Lady’, the well is now a monument that still overlooks the town of Miri.

It is a mark of Malaysia’s extensive oil history, a sign of oil’s continuing importance to the country today, and I firmly believe to its future. This future also needs to be set into the context of the overall theme of this conference: Charting Pathways for a Sustainable Asia.

Allow me to stress that the issue of sustainable energy pathways goes to the core of OPEC’s founding commitment to support a stable and sustainable oil market, in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy.

This has gained additional momentum over the past six years or so in working with other leading oil-producing countries through the DoC.

Together, we have been front-and-centre in supporting a balanced and stable global oil market. This was clearly on display at the most recent ministerial meeting earlier in June, with the group following its successful approach of being precautious, proactive, and pre-emptive.

The importance of market stability is not only vital for the short-term, it is critical for the long-term too.

In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO), we see global energy demand increasing by 23% through 2045, and I see no credible way to address this without utilizing all available energy sources, and with energy market stability as a guiding light.

Renewables will play a much greater role, and contrary to what some may say, OPEC Member Countries are already investing significantly in this area. Gas, hydro, nuclear, hydrogen and biomass will also expand, BUT, it is clear that oil will remain an integral part of the mix.

Every data-based forecast that I have seen shows that oil is irreplaceable for the foreseeable future. In our WOO, we see global oil demand rising to 110 million barrels a day by 2045, and oil still making up about 29% of the energy mix by then.

A massive energy expansion is required as we see the global economy more than doubling in size, and the world’s population reaching 9.5 billion by 2045. Moreover, as we all know, there remains a critical need to bring modern energy services to those billions that continue to go without basic energy access in many parts of the world.

While we must continue to provide more energy to the world, we also recognize the need to continually reduce emissions and decarbonize, subscribing to global best practices and cutting edge, best-in-class technologies. For example, carbon capture utilization and storage, clean hydrogen technologies, the circular carbon economy, and others.

Meeting the expected future energy growth, while also lowering global emissions, requires unprecedented investment and collaboration.

Chronic underinvestment in the industry, not just oil, but across all energies, is putting the viability of the whole energy system at stake. It is a point I have continually highlighted since becoming OPEC Secretary General.

In our WOO, for the oil industry alone, investment requirements equate to $12.1 trillion, or over $500 billion each year between now and 2045.

Recent annual levels have been significantly below this, due to industry downturns, the pandemic, and the increasing focus on environmental, social and governance issues.

All industry policymakers and stakeholders need to work together to ensure a long-term investment-friendly climate, with sufficient finance available. One that works for producers and consumers, as well as developed and developing countries.

For OIL, we have heard appeals over the last year or so for producing countries to play a key role in ensuring stable and sustainable global energy supplies. At the same time, however, we have also constantly heard calls to end financing in oil projects.

The two sentences simply do not fit together.

Let me ask investors in the audience today: would you invest if you do not see security of demand, particularly in an industry where returns can take a decade or more?

Talk of no new investment in oil projects will only lead to energy chaos. We need energy clarity, not energy chaos.

We also need facts, not fantasy to take us through a just, inclusive and realistic transition.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In recent years, we have heard of net-zero targets and scenarios in which global demand drops to around 80 mb/d by 2030, which is more than 20 mb/d below today’s level. We need to remember that 2030 is only six years from now!

Over the period to 2030, however, it is expected that another half a billion people will move into cities across the world as the global economy continues to expand.

Being in Malaysia, and to put this in an understandable context, this urbanization drive will require the addition of approximately 50 new Kuala Lumpurs.

It goes without saying therefore that the world will therefore need more, not less oil, alongside the need to continually reduce emissions.

This returns to me the need for facts and energy clarity.

What has become apparent in the past few years or so is that references to net-zero numbers have sown confusion among investors and policymakers. This is not a positive recipe for either producers nor consumers.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

When I listened to my friend Tan Sri Tengku Taufik in Davos earlier this year, a line stuck out to me. He said when talking about the energy transition: “Don’t sacrifice the good for the perfect.”

It makes absolute sense to me. We cannot get everything absolutely right. Moreover, we need to recognize that we should be talking about energy transitions.

It has to be a plural, as I firmly believe that each nation and peoples have their own energy transition pathway. The capacities and national circumstances of developing countries must be taken into account.

Addressing the energy and climate challenges must put fairness at its heart, making sure businesses, governments, and communities can come together to deliver genuine and real change.

Standing here in Kuala Lumpur is a reminder of two things.

Firstly, that Asia is at the heart of our global energy future. It has to have its own say in the challenges related to its energy security, availability and the need to reduce emissions.

Secondly, the vital role of Malaysia, both as a partner with OPEC in the DoC and as a regional and global energy leader, through both the national government, and its national oil company, Petronas.

At OPEC, we very much look forward to continuing our fruitful collaboration with Malaysia, and ensuring we deliver the energy clarity we all need.

Thank you, and Terima Kasih.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/3-26-june-2023.html"
"2023-06-20","Ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon to all.

It is a great pleasure to be in the great country of Azerbaijan, in the beautiful city of Baku, and at such a distinguished seat of learning, the ADA University.

Fostering the talents of young people, such as those in the audience today from ADA and other institutions, empowering them with knowledge and helping build the next generation of energy leaders is truly an inspirational endeavour.

[SLIDE 2]

It is also something that Azerbaijan and Baku have a prodigious history in, particularly on the back of the country being known as the cradle of the modern oil industry.

Azerbaijan was the location of many ‘firsts’ in the industry’s great ‘Oil Boom’ in the latter half of the 19th century. It was a time when some of the greatest geologists, chemists, entrepreneurs and inventors that our industry has ever known, thrived and fundamentally changed it forever.

In 1846, more than a decade before Colonel Edwin Drake struck oil on American soil for the first time, a 21 metre well was drilled in Bibi-Heybat for oil exploration – the first successfully drilled oil well in human history.

Within three decades of the first oil well being drilled, Azerbaijan witnessed the building of the first wooden oil derrick in 1871, the first distillery in 1876 and the first oil tanker ship in 1878.

These historic milestones would never have been reached without a skilled and dedicated local workforce. This should be an inspiration to all of you here today, as many of the distinguishing features of our industry bear a ‘Made in Azerbaijan’ stamp.

[SLIDE 3]

Turning to our present times, Azerbaijan is a key oil and gas producer to the world, has rich resources in both commodities, and is a vital participant in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) between OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

The DoC was forged at the end of 2016 and since then it has been a cornerstone in helping restore and maintain a balanced and stable market on a sustainable basis, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

This includes helping pick the industry up from two major downturns: that of the period from 2014-16, and most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Azerbaijan played a major role in the historic April 2020 decision to adjust downwards crude oil production by DoC participants. These were the largest and longest adjustments in the history of OPEC, the DoC and the oil industry.

It was an unprecedented challenge that required unparalleled commitment. Every DoC country stepped up and played a role. This continues today as can be viewed in the unanimity displayed in the decisions taken at the recent 35th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting at the start of June.

Here, I would like to personally thank HE President Ilham Aliyev, who was a vocal supporter of bringing OPEC and non-OPEC producers in 2016. He has been a steadfast advocate of the DoC, and his leadership honours his country’s incredible history.

I would also like to thank HE Parviz Shahbazov, Azerbaijan’s Minister of Energy for his tireless dedication to the common endeavours of the DoC. He is a consummate diplomat, and he and his team have been great hosts during our visit this week.

Our industry also needs to look to the future, and I very much hope that many of you here will be part of it.

Over the years, I have personally benefited from amazing opportunities in this industry, and today, I have the great honour to stand before you as OPEC Secretary General.

In this role, I would like to encourage you all that I firmly believe that the future of this industry is bright.

[SLIDE 4]

In OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook (WOO), we see energy demand increasing by a robust 23% to 2045, and oil retaining the largest share of the energy mix throughout the outlook period.

Oil is still set to account for almost 29% of the energy mix in 2045.

We will need all energies in the decades ahead given three critical findings from the WOO. Firstly, we expect the global economy will double in size by 2045. Secondly, the world’s population is expected to hit 9.5 billion by the same time. Thirdly, there remains a critical need to bring modern energy services to those billions that continue to go without.

At the same time, of course, we also recognize the need to tackle climate change. At OPEC, we fully believe that the oil industry can be part of the solution, and help evolve the energy transition.

Or as I am always keen to emphasize: energy transitions. In describing the concept, we should use the plural, as I firmly believe that each nation and peoples have their own energy transition pathway. The capacities and national circumstances of developing countries must be taken into account.

I have no doubt the resources and expertise of our industry can be harnessed to help develop cleaner and more efficient technological solutions, such as carbon capture utilization and storage, hydrogen, and the Circular Carbon Economy. These can all help contribute to a reduction of emissions as part of unlocking a low-emissions future.

OPEC and the DoC have a unique vehicle to explore and evolve such developments, the Charter of Cooperation (CoC). This sits alongside the DoC, and helps facilitate dialogue among stakeholders on longer-term issues impacting the industry.

Our energy future is an 'and' question, not an 'or' question. It is about meeting the world’s energy needs and reducing emissions. Energy security for all and decarbonization must go hand-in-hand.

[SLIDE 5]

What this future also requires is massive investment. In the WOO, we see the oil industry alone requiring $12 trillion in the period to 2045.

In recent years, however, we have heard calls from some to limit or stop funding for new oil and gas projects, and witnessed the impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) constraints on financial institutions.

This is disheartening, and particularly impactful on developing countries with oil and gas resources, such as Azerbaijan.

As an industry it is vital we make our voices heard. We need to underscore the value our industry has brought to the world, and the importance of it to our future.

We all know we have to get our energy future right. We need to be realistic, and as Dr. Sultan bin Ahmed Al Jaber, COP28 president-designate, said earlier this year: “Pragmatism and constructive dialogue must be at the forefront of our progress,”

OPEC is honoured that its Member Country, the UAE, is hosting COP28 later this year. The focus is on an inclusive approach that engages all stakeholders.

[SLIDE 6]

The cog for our energy future is the best young talent rising up and helping this industry successfully navigate the new energy paradigm.

Our industry offers dynamic opportunities to young people with diverse skill sets and educational backgrounds in the sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics.

It is an industry that gives bright young people like yourselves the chance to make a meaningful and sustainable contribution to their community and the world at large.

The tech-savvy youth of this generation are uniquely equipped to utilize the latest technologies and innovations, and apply them to helping adapt and enhance this industry in the decades to come.

ADA University, and the many students I see before me, are at the forefront of creating the opportunities and managing the challenges that lie before the industry today.

I look forward to hearing from you in the Q&A session that will follow, and I hope that, in some measure, I have inspired you to take the baton and run with it because the future is in the hands of the coming generations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/366-20-june-2023.html"
"2023-06-16","Your Royal Highness, Your Excellences, Distinguished Colleagues, Friends,

It is truly a great privilege to stand here before you in the Al-Shaab Hall, the birthplace of OPEC almost 63 years ago.

I would like to extend our deep gratitude to the Iraqi Government, the Oil Ministry and the People of Iraq for hosting us today and for preserving this historic monument.

It was in this hall where our Organization hosted the First Meeting of the OPEC Conference in September 1960, now known as the ‘Baghdad Conference’. It culminated with OPEC’s Founder Members – Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela – establishing the Organization that I am honoured to lead today.

These countries had the courage to do something different, to stand up for their sovereign right to decide what happens to their indigenous resources.

They had the commitment to join together around the premise of cooperation, to forge a new path for oil-producing countries.

Returning here, there is a real sense of the hand of OPEC’s history on our shoulders.

We need to also remind ourselves that the history of OPEC is more than just an appendage to the history of oil.

Now with 13 Member Countries, it is a story of a family of nations and populations. A group that has faced and overcome many challenges and adversities.

It is a story of an Organization evolving to become an established and respected part of the international energy community and multilateral system.

The Organization’s achievements and successes over the past six decades and more constitute a source of pride for all of us.

We have come a long way, but I have no doubt that our best days are still ahead of us.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/373-16-june-2023.html"
"2023-05-24","Excellencies, Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative,

a centerpiece of HE President Xi Jinping's ‘Major Country Diplomacy’ policy.

It is thus a great honour to address the ‘Third Belt and Road Energy Partnership Forum’, as OPEC Secretary General, particularly given that every OPEC Member Country has joined the Belt and Road Initiative by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the People’s Republic of China.

It is also the fourth anniversary of the Belt and Road Energy Partnership, a platform for broadening energy cooperation. The importance of this is also referenced in the overall theme of this forum: ‘Stepping towards High-quality Energy Development’.

At OPEC, we applaud the dialogue initiatives of the People’s Republic of China on energy, based on the principles of fairness, equity and mutual respect. It mirrors what OPEC is also focused on in this regard.

Only last week, we held the 6th High-level Meeting of OPEC-China Energy Dialogue, an extremely positive and productive meeting with His Excellency Zhang Jianhua, Administrator of the National Energy Administration, the People’s Republic of China, and his team, in Beijing. I do second the statement from HE Zhang Jianhua that “China and OPEC are important strategic partners”.

This is just one of many energy dialogues that OPEC participates in.

These will be vital as the world navigates the major energy challenges before us, those related to energy security, energy affordability and decarbonization.

We need to ensure energy is affordable and available for all; we need to transition to a more inclusive, fair, and equita¬ble world in which every person has access to energy as referenced in UN Sustainable Development Goal 7; and we need to reduce emissions.

With these in mind, and with energy demand set to rise by 23% by 2045, what the world needs is investment, investment, investment.

Despite what some may have us believe, we need to invest in all energies, we need to invest in all technologies that reduce emissions, and we need to invest in all peoples to alleviate the scourge of energy poverty.

Our energy future is about energy transitions. I stress that in the plural. OPEC firmly believes that each nation and peoples have their own energy transition pathway.

This means deepening our understanding of each other’s energy needs, and fostering good relations with all energy stakeholders.

As the old Chinese proverb tells us, “the going is difficult when doing it alone; the going is made easier when doing it with many others.""

It is clear this is a focus of the ‘Third Belt and Road Energy Partnership Forum’.

Thank you, and I wish all those involved a successful forum.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/372-24-may-2023.html"
"2023-05-22","Your Highness, Excellencies, Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to participate at the 30th Annual Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference (MPGC). I would like to thank our hosts the Government of the United Arab Emirates, the Emirates National Oil Company, and S&P Global Commodity Insights for the invitation to speak and the gracious hospitality.

The President of the UAE, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, announced at the beginning of the year that 2023 will be the “Year of Sustainability.” This reflects this country’s longstanding commitment to sustainable practices and international cooperation to address the challenges of our times.

The culmination of the “Year of Sustainability” will be Dubai’s hosting of the COP28, which represents a moment of tremendous pride for OPEC.

Our Organization has a long history of supporting environmental issues and sustainable development. We have been directly involved in the evolution of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), from the UN Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee in 1990 to the present day.

The UAE has repeatedly shown climate leadership, particularly through its ‘Net Zero by 2050’ strategic initiative and investing $40 billion in the renewables industry to date. Astonishing progress has been achieved in a relatively short period of time.

We have followed with interest the calls by COP28 President Designate, His Excellency Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, for a positive, pragmatic and above all, realistic approach to the climate challenge.

The reality is that oil and gas will continue to be an integral part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future. According to OPEC’s World Oil Outlook, oil is expected to retain the largest share in the energy mix throughout the outlook period, accounting for almost a 29% share in 2045.

The global economy in 2045 is expected to be double the size it is today. The global population is set to increase by 1.6 billion people between now and 2045. As a result of these global demographic and economic changes, energy demand is forecast to increase by a significant 23% in the period to 2045.

Such an increase in demand necessitates adequate investment in our industry. The global oil sector will need cumulative investment of $12.1 trillion through to 2045. Investment is also urgent to account for annual decline rates, which amount to about 5% in our industry.

Despite the urgent need for investment, we have heard disheartening calls from some quarters to divest from hydrocarbons.

OPEC has been clear in highlighting the very real and dangerous consequences of divestment or underinvestment in the oil industry:

Given these high stakes, as an industry, we need to speak with one voice and louder than ever before on the harmful realities of underinvestment. Indeed, the antidote is international cooperation based on mutual respect, multilateralism and constructive dialogue, not constant and inconsistent criticism.

For its part, OPEC has sought to do this through our partnership with 10 non-OPEC producers under the banner of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation,’ as well as our international energy dialogues with many partners, including many key consumers globally.

On a positive note, it is particularly encouraging that many OPEC Member Countries have heeded the call to invest in all sectors of the oil value chain. For example, ADNOC is ramping up production capacity to 5 mb/d by 2030, Saudi Aramco is taking steps to increase to 13 mb/d by 2027, Kuwait to 4 mb/d by 2040, and Iraq to 6 mb/d by 2027.

OPEC Member Countries are also investing significantly in the downstream sector. Recent examples include ADNOC’s Crude Flexibility Project at the Al Ruwais refinery here in the UAE, the Dangote Refinery in Nigeria and the CFP project and Al Zour refinery in my home country of Kuwait.

Your Highness, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

OPEC believes that the challenge before us must be accurately diagnosed. It is about reducing greenhouse gas emissions and not the misguided narrative of replacing one energy source with another.

Technological innovation will play a critical in realizing this objective. This is why our Member Countries invest heavily in hydrogen projects, carbon capture utilization and storage facilities, and the circular carbon economy.

There is no better place than the UAE that exemplifies this. The Al –Reyadah CCUS facility has an 800,000 tonnes per year of CO2 capture capacity. Work is ongoing to increase this capacity by 500% to approximately 5 million tonnes per year by 2030.

The breadth of measures the UAE has deployed to tackle the climate challenge is critical because there is no panacea to address it. We need to focus on ‘all-peoples, all-fuels and all-technologies’ approach for the energy transitions.

I stress it as a plural, as OPEC firmly believes each nation and peoples have their own energy transition pathway.

The capacities and national circumstances of developing countries must be taken into account in all actions. We should never forget that climate change and sustainable development are two sides of the same coin.

According to the UN, 733 million people do not have access to electricity. Furthermore, one third of the world’s population use dangerous or inefficient cooking systems, which causes a host of health related problems.

Therefore, policy-makers need to be cognizant that even the best intentioned policies, can have unintended consequences. This increases the stakes in the ‘policy-design’ phase.

Your Highness, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

As oil and gas industry representatives in this audience today you may know that the industry has been challenged recently by some to rise to a ‘moment of truth’ at COP28.

Obviously, I cannot claim to speak on behalf of everyone here, but I believe that the industry must recognize and be proud of what it has been doing in terms of ensuring global energy security and reducing emissions across the board.

Energy security for all and decarbonization must go hand-in-hand. This requires major investments in all energies. This is the truth that needs to be spoken.

Your Highness, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I would like to conclude my remarks by underscoring OPEC’s appreciation for the UAE’s leadership role in the energy sector, tackling the climate challenge, and bringing stakeholders together at COP28.

This mirrors the constructive role the nation plays in OPEC and OPEC+, acting as a builder of consensus and forger of cooperation, under the able leadership of the UAE’s head of delegation to OPEC, HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure.

On behalf of the entire OPEC Family, I would like to sincerely thank the UAE for this contribution to making OPEC the successful and vibrant Organization that it is today.

Thank you for your kind attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/4-22-may-2023.html"
"2023-05-16","Your Excellency, Ladies and gentlemen,

Allow me to begin by thanking Your Excellency, Zhang Jianhua, Administrator of the National Energy Administration, People’s Republic of China, for the warm welcome.

My colleagues and I are delighted to be in the great city of Beijing and are extremely grateful to our Chinese hosts for your gracious hospitality. On behalf of OPEC, let me express our pleasure in participating in the 6th High-level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue.

The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation continues to be one of the most significant developments for the global economy this century. OPEC attaches tremendous importance to our dialogue partnership with China and we are determined to continually reinforce and strengthen it.

On a personal note, earlier in my career, I had the privilege of living and working in China in my capacity as Head of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation’s Regional Office in Beijing. I developed a strong affection for Beijing, China, and the Chinese people.

At the first High-Level meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue which took place in 2005 in Beijing, we committed ourselves to establish a balanced, pragmatic framework for cooperation, and develop an ongoing exchange of views at all levels on energy issues of common interest, in particular security of supply and demand, in order to enhance market stability.

The current vibrancy of our dialogue reflects the fact that we continue to fulfil the mission set 18 years ago.

Indeed, there are many factors that bring us together.

China’s overall imports from OPEC Member Countries amounted to $172.7 billion in 2021. This is a staggering $164.4 billion increase from 2000. In the other direction, OPEC’s total imports from China increased from just under $5.7 billion in 2000 to around $134.7 billion in 2021.

In terms of crude oil, China’s total imports have risen from around 1.4 mb/d in 2000 to approximately 10.3 mb/d in 2021. Close to 51% of this came from OPEC Member Countries.

In the immediate term, the first quarter of this year underscored the fact that Chinese GDP growth benefits the global economy. In recent months, China has seen strong growth in exports, infrastructure investment and retail spending. The country is on track to meet its GDP growth target of 5% for the year.

In the longer term, OPEC recognizes the pivotal role China will play in the future of the world economy and energy sector ̶ a key conclusion from our World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2022.

According to the WOO, China’s proportion of global GDP is expected to rise from 19% in 2021 to 23% in 2045.

Total primary energy demand in China is expected to rise from 69.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d) to 77.5 mboe/d in 2045.

Oil is forecast to grow from around 20.5% of China’s primary energy demand in 2021 to 21.3% in 2045.

This growth in Chinese demand is an important factor in global primary energy demand increasing by 23% in the period to 2045. All forms of energy will be necessary to meet this demand increase.

To meet the demand needs of the future, it is absolutely pivotal that the global oil industry attracts adequate levels of investments. The WOO reports that the global oil sector will need cumulative investment of $12.1 trillion through to 2045.

We need this investment to encourage the development of technologies that will reduce the environmental footprint of the oil industry. Oil will continue to remain a critical part of the energy mix for the foreseeable future and it is therefore important to use technologies such as Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage, the Circular Carbon Economy framework and hydrogen, to unlock a low-emissions future.

Oil market stability is a prerequisite for an investment-enabling environment. For this reason, OPEC and 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries have been engaged since 2017 in concerted efforts to contribute to oil market stability. We meet regularly, analyze market developments and take action as appropriate. Such actions have seen the oil market experience stability relative to other commodities over the last year or so.

Excellency, Ladies and gentlemen,

In June of last year, President Xi chaired the High-level Dialogue on Global Development. The Heads of Government of several OPEC Member Countries were in attendance. What was a particularly pleasing outcome of this meeting was the practical measures President Xi outlined to expedite the implementation of the UN’s Sustainable Development Agenda.

While, of course, OPEC supports the implementation of all of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we have a special interest in SDG 7, which seeks to ensure affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

The statistics on energy access are concerning. Approximately 733 million people worldwide do not have access to electricity and 2.4 billion people use inefficient and polluting cooking systems.

For this reason, President Xi’s commitment to forging ‘High-quality Partnership for a New Era of Global Development,’ is an extremely important component of the global community achieving the ambitious SDG’s.

Excellency, Ladies and gentlemen,

The ancient China proverb tells us “With one heart and one mind, we can accomplish everything we aspire for.” OPEC is committed to working with China in pursuit of our mutual goal of stability in the oil market, which supports global economic growth and sustainable development.

We value our partnership and I look forward to productive discussions today.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/371-16-may-2023.html"
"2023-02-12","Excellencies, esteemed delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is my pleasure to welcome you to this 2nd High-level Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue. I am very pleased that we could all gather here in Africa, in the beautiful city of Cairo, to exchange ideas and expertise.

Allow me to recognize my distinguished colleagues from our partner organizations:

Her Excellency Dr. Amani Abou-Zeid, African Union Commissioner for Infrastructure and Energy;

His Excellency Dr. Omar Farouk Ibrahim, Secretary General of the African Petroleum Producers’ Organization (APPO);

His Excellency Anibor Kragha, Executive Secretary of the African Refiners and Distributors Association (ARDA).

Excellencies, I want to thank you for your staunch support for this important Dialogue. Your combined experience and knowledge of African energy affairs are highly valued, and we look forward to benefiting from your expert insights.

Our meeting today is part of OPEC’s extensive programme of dialogue initiatives, which include the European Union, China, India, Russia, as well as international organizations and global corporations.

We look forward to exploring avenues for enhanced dialogue with other energy producers and consumers as well. These initiatives underpin our belief that cooperation and dialogue among all energy stakeholders are absolutely essential to effectively address our common energy needs.

In a moment, we will have a chance to hear remarks from our partner organizations. Afterwards, there will be time for discussion on key topics facing Africa, including energy investment and finance, as well as the ever-evolving energy transition.

To help set the stage, I would like to briefly share OPEC’s views on the important issues we are covering in today’s Dialogue.

In terms of industry investment at the global level, we forecast cumulative oil-related investment requirements from now until 2045 to be approximately $12.1 trillion. Of this, $9.5 trillion will go to upstream projects, $1.6 trillion to the downstream and $1 trillion to the midstream.

Looking more specifically at Africa, our 2022 study entitled “Investment requirements for Africa” tells us that oil and gas will remain the major drivers in the energy mix across the continent between 2025 and 2045.

Africa has invested heavily in its oil and gas sector over the past 60 years. However, looking ahead, we forecast that total cumulative investments of nearly $716 billion are required to sustain the oil and gas supply in Africa between 2025 and 2045.

If these investment needs are not met, we could eventually see supply shortfalls, resulting in heightened volatility.

Allow me to add here that our efforts through the Declaration of Cooperation are aimed at providing stable energy markets, which, in turn, are a pre-requisite for investor confidence and increased investment going forward.

In terms of the energy transition, we continue to see countries in Africa and around the world struggling to find the right balance between supporting their economic development priorities while also adapting to the rapidly changing dynamics related to climate change.

In this context, Africa is in a fragile position. In addition to suffering serious economic setbacks due to the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors, African countries stand to be on the losing end of the consequences of climate change.

Unfortunately, the inequalities that existed previously are now in danger of being multiplied.

COP27, which took place here in Egypt, provided a strategic platform for OPEC’s Member Countries to advocate for a balanced and fair process on issues related to adaptation, mitigation and the means of implementation, particularly with regard to climate finance and technology.

We were able to successfully relay our message that there is simply no ‘one size fits all’ solution. Different countries around the world have varying capabilities and diverse needs.

During the negotiations, we also emphasized the fact that any future energy and climate roadmap must be developed in accordance with the core principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  namely equity, historical responsibility and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This is essential, particularly for Africa, to ensure that its unique circumstances are taken into consideration.

Although there is still much work to be done, I do believe our voices must continue to be heard!

In this respect, we look forward to COP-28, which will take place under the leadership of an OPEC Member Country, the United Arab Emirates. I would note here that the UAE has become a recognized leader in investing in technologies to reduce the oil industry’s carbon footprint, and is therefore well-positioned to promote inclusive solutions to our world’s climate challenges.

My final point has to do with the topic of energy poverty.

It is a sad fact that, as of 2020, roughly 733 million people were still without access to electricity, and about 80% are here in Africa.

On top of this, approximately 2.4 billion people, or around one-third of the global population, still had no opportunities for clean cooking solutions. I should add here that in Sub-Saharan Africa, 920 million are still without access to clean cooking fuels, an increase from 750 million in 2010.

This is simply unacceptable.

At last year’s Africa Energy Week in Cape Town, I made an appeal to world leaders to unite and mobilize their collective resources and political support to help reverse this tragic situation and bridge the gap between developed and developing countries.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

Today, we will have an opportunity to further expound upon these key topics and exchange viewpoints during our discussions. I very much look forward to your highly valued input.

Thus, with no further ado, allow me to give the floor to Her Excellency Dr. Abou-Zeid, who will share with us some introductory remarks.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/370-12-february-2023.html"
"2023-02-07","Excellencies, colleagues, dear friends,

Ladies and gentlemen,

On behalf of OPEC, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak at this 9th Asian Ministerial Roundtable and thankful to India for hosting this event.

I want to give special thanks to His Excellency Shri Hardeep Puri, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas & Housing and Urban Affairs of India and HE Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum for extending the kind invitation to speak at this special event.

I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate HE Sultan Al Jaber, Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology and Special Envoy for Climate of the United Arab Emirates on his appointment as the president-designate for the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP28. I am confident that under his capable leadership HE Jaber will ensure balanced, ambitious, and inclusive outcomes.

This roundtable last took place in September 2019 in Abu Dhabi. A lot has changed in the world since then.

The Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) has proven to be pivotal in attending to the market instability that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting repercussions, and more recently signs of economic headwinds.

Continuing their commendable efforts, countries participating in the DoC remain fully focused on ensuring stability and balanced market fundamentals in 2023, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The topics being discussed here today — energy security, energy poverty, affordability and decarbonization — cut to the very core of what we are all facing as citizens across the globe.

Last year saw unprecedented hikes in natural gas prices that left markets spinning and consumers — even in developed regions such as Europe — reeling from energy costs that tripled or quadrupled on short notice.

The energy crisis and geopolitical issues have in turn impeded advances in the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 on energy access. For example, almost 90 million people in Asia and Africa who previously had access to energy are no longer in a position to pay for their basic energy needs.

Issues around energy security and affordability have led to countries placing energy security alongside or even above their climate change agendas.

At OPEC we have been talking about an ‘orderly’ energy transition for many years. This means not discriminating against any one source of energy, but rather finding ways to cut and finally eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from all sources.

Let me reiterate that the issue at hand is emissions reduction, not a choice between fuels.

Averting an energy crisis in the future also means jump-starting investment in the oil industry. It is no longer a question of whether investment is required, but how we can meet investment requirements by creating an investment-friendly climate.

Up to 2045, we see that $12.1 trillion will be required in the upstream, mainstream and downstream. Moreover, oil is still expected to fill 29% of basic energy requirements by that date.

Many other stakeholders are now saying what OPEC has stated for years, that a lack of investment is jeopardizing future energy security and that we must act now.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The energy transition is moving forward, as is decarbonization, in order to meet the Paris Agreement goals to keep the global temperature rise in this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

OPEC supports this. There are no climate change deniers at OPEC.

Many of our Member Countries are industry leaders in renewables. However, they are continuing to invest in oil too, knowing that all forms of energy will be required.

I want to underline that the chronic investment challenge is a global one, requiring global solutions.

Both producers and consumers have a shared interest in sustaining oil market stability and ensuring long-term investments.

This brings me to the value of cooperation. In this regard, we continue to work with all our dialogue partners, from consumers and producers, to analysts and institutions of learning and we are also reaching out to new partners.

We firmly believe that multilateral solutions through dialogue are the best way forward.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Being here in the wonderful country of India, brings me back to the continent of Asia.

The region will be the engine of economic growth and oil demand in the decades to come.

India and China alone will account for 37% of global GDP in 2045, with India seeing the greatest gains by far at 6.1% p.a. in this time frame.

India will also account for 28% of the expansion in primary energy demand growth in this period. The country’s oil demand is set to increase from 4.8 million barrels a day (mb/d) in 2021 to 11.1 mb/d in 2045.

Imports will increase from nearly all regions, but mainly from the Middle East, the home of many OPEC Members. I want to reassure you that OPEC Member Countries remain committed to ensuring that our Asian partners have a secure supply of oil.

This also reinforces the importance of a regular exchange of information and understanding of the oil market’s short- and long-term dynamics.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to our dialogue.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/369-7-february-2023.html"
"2023-01-28","We have lost an OPEC icon, an Indonesian patriot and a truly, great man.

To Mrs Ratih Dardo, Dr Subroto’s wife; to his family; friends and all who mourn his passing; on behalf of OPEC, I offer our deepest and heartfelt sympathies.

As friends and family gather to pray for Dr Subroto following 40 days since his passing, OPEC shares your grief; for Dr Subroto was one of the most significant figures in the history of our Organization. This is a sad occasion but we also take the opportunity to thank the Almighty for the great gift of Dr Subroto’s life, his many contributions to our Organization’s betterment and the inspiring example he left for successive generations to come.

His was a life well-lived and he had a starring role in many historical moments for the oil industry, particularly during his tenure as Secretary General from 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1994.

Way ahead of his time, he was also a champion of OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation since the 1980s.

One can trace a ‘through line’ from the seeds of dialogue with non-OPEC countries that Dr Subroto planted to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ signed on 10 December 2016.

On the 8th of September last year, the staff of the OPEC Secretariat were honoured to listen to Dr Subroto as he joined us for a virtual town hall meeting, just days before OPEC’s 62nd anniversary and his 99th birthday.

Many of the veterans who remain from when Dr Subroto was Secretary General provided their personal recollections of working with him. And what they said was a moving testimony to his decency, kindness and humanity.

Everybody who knew and worked with him spoke fondly of the ‘smiling SG.’ He was supportive and positive, knew how to nurture talent and bring the best out of people.

The measure of any person is how they treat others. Dr Subroto was exemplary in this regard, for he treated everyone with graciousness and kindness.

For our part at the OPEC Secretariat, we are resolved to honour his legacy and aspire to the high standards of excellence he set.

Allow me to conclude, by once again, extending our deepest condolences to all of you gathered for this event commemorating Dr Subroto’s life. Although he has passed, we all still feel the warmth of his kind smile and the memory of his rich life will guide us in the years to come.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/368-28-january-2023.html"
"2023-01-17","Good morning and Happy New Year!

It is a great privilege to join so many distinguished colleagues here in Davos. I wish to thank Majid Jafar and Crescent Petroleum for bringing us together, and for providing a delicious breakfast to give us strength for the busy day ahead.

As all who follow the energy news know, Majid Jafar is an eloquent advocate of the oil and gas business. Under his leadership, Crescent Petroleum has become a driver of innovation and one of the big success stories in the Middle East’s upstream oil and gas sector.

I also applaud Crescent for championing dialogue through its Ideas Forum, including this morning’s very timely discussion on the ‘Energy Trilemma: Achieving availability, affordability and sustainability’.

This topic goes to the core of OPEC’s founding commitment to support a stable and sustainable oil market in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy.

Building on its celebrated history, OPEC in recent years has gained additional momentum by working with other leading oil-producing countries through the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC).

Together, we have been front-and-centre in supporting the global market, as evidenced by the decisions at the end of 2022 to adjust oil production downward by 2 million barrels per day (mb/d). This has contributed to an improvement in spare capacity and market stability heading into the new year.

To give you an idea of what we expect in 2023, OPEC’s latest forecast sees the global economy expanding by around 2.5 per cent and oil demand rising by about 2.2 mb/d to almost 102 mb/d. This would put us well beyond the pre-pandemic high of nearly 100 mb/d, and sets the stage for future growth.

Of course, the current dynamics are extremely fluid, and we are monitoring a number of moving targets on our radar screen. This is why OPEC and our DoC partners continue to be attentive to market conditions and prepared to act when necessary, a formula that has provided assurance to the global oil market for more than six years.

Looking further down the road, OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook (WOO) sees the global economy more than doubling in size from now until 2045, with oil demand rising by about 10 mb/d in the same period, to around 110 mb/d.

I would point out that the developing and emerging economies will account for significant growth of around 23 mb/d up to 2045. These countries will more than make up for an expected drop [10.7 mb/d] in demand from the advanced economies.

Within the sectors, road and air transportation, along with petrochemicals, will be key drivers of oil demand. The post-lockdown resumption of events like the World Economic Forum, and the full stadiums at the 2022 World Cup, are evidence of the continuing recovery in air travel.

Taking into account all the factors at play, these are not easy times for oil demand forecasters. Nonetheless, I am especially proud of OPEC’s research team for the consistently high quality of their forecasts and outlooks. This is reflected in the fact that some of the other leading energy agencies have moved closer to our figures in recent months, and some news organizations have reported on the accuracy of OPEC’s forecasts.

Dear colleagues,

At the start of 2023, the oil industry is at a tipping point. Without a steady boost in investment across the value chain, it will be difficult to achieve the availability, affordability and sustainability that we are discussing this morning.

Yet, we continue to face efforts to create a policy rulebook that stigmatizes hydrocarbons and seeks to divert much-needed investment away from the industry. This situation has stoked uncertainty and volatility to the detriment of producers and consumers – and ultimately global energy security.

In fact, I see no credible way to address the expected 23 per cent rise in global energy demand through 2045 without having a diverse energy mix – with oil remaining an integral part of the mix. Every data-based forecast that I know of shows that oil is irreplaceable for the foreseeable future.

Unfortunately, the oil industry has been plagued by several years of persistent underinvestment, which has manifested itself in production constraints, shrinking spare capacity and reduced refinery output. Regarding the latter, a few months ago OPEC Member Countries and other oil producers were blamed for tightness in downstream fuel supplies. However, we believe – and have highlighted this on many occasions – that the root causes include a steady decline in refinery capacity in some of the main consuming countries.

The picture becomes clearer when you take a hard look at the data. OPEC’s latest estimates show that global refinery closures amounted to 4.3 mb/d between 2020 and 2022, with a further decline of 800,000 b/d possible this year, much of this in developed countries. By contrast, many OPEC Member Countries and other developing regions are hard at work expanding their refining capacity to address the global demand for fuels.

All of this underscores the importance of the need to invest, invest, invest.

OPEC’s annual WOO shows that the global oil sector will need cumulative investment of around $12.1 trillion through 2045, and 79 per cent [$9.5 trillion] of this is needed in the upstream.

Upstream capital expenditure has picked up as the markets rebalance, yet the results of recent underinvestment may become more apparent in the medium term.

Steady and stable investment is also essential if the industry is innovate and contribute to lowering its carbon footprint. With respect to OPEC, our Member Countries are leading by example with significant investments in clean hydrocarbon technologies, as well as renewables. In addition, we are on the cutting edge in harnessing the potential of carbon capture, hydrogen and other innovations. You would expect to hear this from the OPEC Secretary General – but these efforts are getting global attention in respected sources like the Economist magazine.

OPEC is fully committed to an energy transition that is orderly, inclusive and helps ensure energy security for all nations.

At the multilateral level, OPEC countries have broken new ground when it comes to global energy dialogue and cooperation. This was evident in 2020, when Saudi Arabia provided steady leadership of the G20 as the pandemic upended the global economy and energy markets. This year, the United Arab Emirates will play a central role in the global climate negotiations as host of the next UN COP28.

I welcome the United Arab Emirates’ decision to name a prominent oil executive, HE Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, as President-Designate for COP28. Dr Sultan is an innovator; a proven leader in moving the oil industry towards a lower-carbon future; and as the Emirates’ special climate envoy, he is uniquely positioned to promote the broad-based cooperation that is needed to tackle the world’s climate challenges.

With COP28 on the horizon, it is very timely that OPEC’s upcoming 8th International Seminar will focus on how to achieve a sustainable and inclusive energy transition. I hope that many of you will join us in Vienna this July for this highly-anticipated event.

Looking to the future, I am confident that the world can achieve a successful energy transition through an all-energies, all-technologies and all-peoples approach.

I very much look forward to this morning’s give-and-take, and wish to reiterate my thanks to Majid Jafar and Crescent Petroleum for getting our day off to such a good start.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/367-17-january-2023.html"
"2022-11-16","Madame President, distinguished delegates,

Thank you to Egypt for the gracious hospitality and excellent arrangements.

At this pivotal point in negotiations ̶ significantly ̶ COP27 returns us to Africa.

Africa is vital for OPEC; seven of our 13 Member Countries hail from this great continent.

Being in Egypt that is also a country with significant and diverse energy resources, underlines the importance of having all voices at the table.

We need to abide by the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, with developed countries taking the lead to address climate change and fulfilling their commitments to support developing countries. A promise made, but unfortunately not yet delivered.

Our approach must be guided by trust and inclusivity, consider the particular circumstances and priorities of developing countries, and ensure a low-emissions future in which every person has access to energy.

Clarity and transparency with commitment are required on climate finance and investment. We have heard calls for energy-exporting countries to play a key role in ensuring stable global energy markets, and, simultaneously calls for an end to financing hydrocarbon projects.

The complex and intertwined challenges of energy affordability, energy access, energy security and sustainability must be supported through this multilateral process, recognizing the sovereignty of all nations and the right to development.

The multiple global crises we face underline the importance of working with, rather than against each other.

A just and inclusive transition is not about the misguided narrative of abandoning one energy source for another.

The key lies in ensuring a long-term investment-friendly climate, with sufficient finance available; one that is fair and viable for both producers and consumers; developed and developing nations.

For the oil industry alone, we see global investment requirements totaling $12.1 trillion between now and 2045.

The oil industry is part of the solution. Its resources and expertise can be harnessed to help develop efficient technological solutions, such as CCUS, the CCE framework and hydrogen, ones that can contribute to a reduction in emissions as part of unlocking a low-emissions future.

There are already technologies available in OPEC Member Countries that can contribute to significant emission reductions.

Oil is set to represent at least 29% of the global energy mix by 2045. Relying solely on renewables will not provide the energy the world needs. The focus should be on all energies.

Science shows us that there is no one size fits all solution and technologies such those I have highlighted are required to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. This is also evident in IPCC reports.

These are not myths. They are facts. If we do not get it right this time then we could sow the seeds for future energy crises.

We need to focus on ‘all-peoples, all-fuels and all-technologies’ approach. This will be vital in finding a sustainable way forward that leaves no one behind.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/5-16-november-2022.html"
"2022-10-31","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure for me personally, and the team here from the OPEC Secretariat, to present our flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook 2022, here at ADIPEC.

I would like to thank the Government of the United Arab Emirates, its Energy Ministry, ADNOC, as well as all the organizers of ADIPEC, who have provided us with this platform ADIPEC, held under the Patronage of His Highness, Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, has evolved into one of the world’s top-tier international energy conferences and exhibitions.

For OPEC, this high-calibre event, hosted by our Member Country, the UAE, is a yearly highlight on our events calendar.

This year’s Outlook is the 16th edition. It has evolved in many ways since it was first launched in 2007, but its key guiding principle remains the same: to support sustainable market stability and to provide a transparent platform from which to review, analyze and evaluate how the oil and energy scene may develop in the years and decades ahead.

The issue of sustainable market stability, as well as helping return balance to the market, can also be seen clearly through the prism of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between 23 OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ that provides a longer-term institutional framework for this landmark cooperation.

My colleagues will provide you with a more in-depth insight into some of the main highlights and takeaways of this year’s Outlook, but I would like to reemphasize one key point that I have made on many occasions since I became OPEC Secretary General. That issue is chronic industry underinvestment.

The Outlook sees energy demand expanding by 23% between now and 2045, or 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent a day annually.

Today, however, the reality globally is that there is a huge shortfall in investments to meet this expected future demand. The sustainability of the global energy system is at stake.

For the oil industry alone, we see global investment requirements totalling $12.1 trillion between now and 2045. This is not only to add new capacity, but also to manage annual average industry decline rates of around 5%.

This equates to over $500 billion each year, with recent annual levels significantly below this, due to industry downturns, the pandemic, and the increasing focus on ESG issues. It is a multi-decade investment challenge.

We need all industry stakeholders to work together to ensure a long-term investment-friendly climate, with sufficient finance available. One that is sustainable and works for both producers, and consumers, and developed and developing countries.

OPEC is fully committed to helping ensure the oil industry has a sustainable and stable environment that enables investments to be made. This is evidently on display here in the UAE that has plans to boost crude oil production capacity to five million barrels a day by 2030, and reduce emissions at the same time.

With that, let me take this opportunity to thank the WOO team at the Secretariat, which year-on-year continues to push the boundaries of our research, to provide more data and analysis that can stimulate both debate and action.

And thank you to everyone here in attendance. We appreciate you listening, are we look forward to your questions later.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/359-31-october-2022.html"
"2022-10-18","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It gives me great pleasure to be here with you to take part in Africa Energy Week 2022.

I would like to commend my predecessor and my late brother, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, who was a native son and true champion of Africa. His contributions to this continent, to his native Nigeria and indeed to OPEC are too numerous to mention here.

Now, allow me to thank the organizers and sponsors of Africa Energy Week, in particular NJ Ayuk, Chairman of the Africa Energy Chamber for inviting me to participate in this important event.

I could not think of a more beautiful and pristine location to host an event than this magnificent city of Cape Town. This city’s magical mix of natural beauty, history and sophistication truly set it apart as a world treasure!

Africa Energy Week continues to go from strength to strength and is now a leading event on the global industry calendar.

I am very pleased to see many of OPEC’s Heads of Delegation participating here, as well as some that are part of the OPEC-non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation.

I would like to cordially invite you all to attend the OPEC-Africa Roundtable Dialogue, which

will take place tomorrow.

I will co-chair this event along with the OPEC President of the Conference, His Excellency

Bruno Jean-Richard Itoua. Please do join us.

Allow me to take a moment to thank the President for his ongoing leadership of OPEC during these challenging times, and also recognize the highly successful efforts of the OPEC-non- OPEC Declaration of Cooperation, or DoC, under the leadership of Chairman, HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia and Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.

The producers of the DoC remain a vital stabilizing force in the global energy markets during this turbulent period of uncertainty and heightened volatility.

The last Ministerial Meeting of the DoC was held two weeks ago, and the OPEC and non- OPEC Heads of Delegation unanimously decided to take a proactive and pre-emptive stance in their efforts to foster a sustainable stability in the global markets.

With macroeconomic headwinds forecast for the months ahead and the very real potential for a global recession, there was a consensus among the Ministers regarding the need to act now to prevent a crisis later.

I want to thank our African Heads of Delegation for their ongoing support of these global efforts to stem the tide of volatility and to promote a lasting stability in the market. OPEC has more than six decades of experience in navigating the ups and downs of the global oil market, and one thing is clear – our actions in the short term most certainly have an impact on the longer term.

On the 31 October, we will be launching our 2022 World Oil Outlook at ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi. This annual flagship publication provides a detailed overview of our most recent long-term forecasts for the energy markets. I would like to cordially invite all of you who will be at this year’s ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi to join us for this special event.

Allow me to just highlight a few key points from the WOO that are relevant to our discussions today.

Firstly, demand for energy will continue to rise dramatically. We forecast that global energy demand will increase by 23%, from 286 mboe/d in 2021 to reach 351 mboe/d in 2045.

Despite a minor decline, oil will retain the largest share of the energy mix by 2045. The combined market share of oil and gas in the global primary energy mix is expected to remain above 50% to 2045. Nearly 71% of this demand will come from non-OECD countries, predominantly in Asia, but also from Africa.

Another key issue is the dire need for increased industry investment. Cumulative oil-related investment requirements from now until 2045 are estimated to total $12.1 trillion. Of this, $9.5 trillion will go to upstream projects, $1.6 trillion to the downstream and $1 trillion to the midstream.

If these investment needs are not met, we could eventually see a supply shortfall, resulting in heightened volatility. And, let me add here, that our efforts through the Declaration of Cooperation are aimed at providing stable energy markets, which, in turn, are a pre-requisite for investor confidence and increased investment going forward.

The WOO also covers another key topic, which is highly relevant to Africa, and that is the urgent need to reverse the trends contributing to energy poverty.

It is a sad fact that, as of 2020, roughly 733 million people were still without access to electricity, and about 80 % of these are here in Africa.

On top of this, approximately 2.4 billion people, or nearly one-third of the global population, still had no opportunities for clean cooking solutions. I should add here that in Sub-Saharan Africa, 920 million are still without access to clean cooking fuels, an increase from 750 million in 2010.

This is simply unacceptable. I call on world leaders to unite and to mobilize their collective resources and political support to help reverse this tragic situation and bridge the gap between developed and developing countries.

OPEC supports the first-ever universal goal related to energy, SDG7, which seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.

I think you would all agree that access to energy, like education and health care, should not be considered a luxury, but a basic human right.

OPEC will continue to work closely with our Member Countries to advocate for real and lasting change on this issue.

And finally, the overarching issue of climate change and the ever-evolving energy transition will have massive implications for Africa.

Countries around the world continue to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics in the energy industry in an effort to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

In this context, Africa is unfortunately in a fragile position. In addition to suffering serious economic setbacks due to the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, African countries stand to be on the losing end of the consequences of climate change.

Unfortunately, the inequalities that were already in place previously are now in danger of being amplified.

Thus, going forward, OPEC will continue to advocate for a balanced, equitable and inclusive energy transition that leaves no one behind. And OPEC will continue to advocate for Africa! COP27, which will take place next month in Egypt, will provide a strategic platform for OPEC’s Member Countries to advocate for a balanced and fair process on issues related to adaptation, mitigation and the means of implementation, particularly climate finance and technology.

As an industry, we must approach these critical issues together through dialogue and cooperation, ensuring that all voices are heard and all viewpoints are considered.

Simply said, there is no “one size fits all” solution. Different countries around the world have varying capabilities and diverse needs. Thus, reducing emissions should have multiple paths, as set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and all of them should be considered as potential options.

Additionally, it is important to remember that any future energy and climate roadmap will need to be developed in accordance with the core principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, namely equity, historical responsibility and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. This will be crucial, particularly for Africa, to ensure that its unique circumstances are taken into consideration.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I want to conclude with a few words on Africa’s key role within OPEC and its contributions to the wider oil and gas industry.

With seven Members – Algeria, Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Libya and Nigeria – Africa makes up more than half of OPEC’s overall Membership.

This increasing presence of Africa within OPEC led to the establishment in June of 2021 of the first-ever High-level Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue.

This highly successful event is the latest in OPEC’s portfolio of global energy dialogues, which include the European Union, Russia, China, India, US independent producers, the GECF, in addition to other international organizations and corporations.

Through this Dialogue with Africa, we look forward to enhancing our focus on the continent and its promising energy future.

And indeed, the future of Africa's oil industry is bright and the opportunities are vast. Home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world and several top gas-producing nations, the continent’s precious resources will continue to be highly sought after in the long-term horizon in order to meet the rapidly rising global demand for oil and gas.

As of 2021, Africa was estimated to have proven oil reserves amounting to around 120 billion barrels. As far as production levels go, as of 2019, the continent produced 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around 9% of world output.

On the demand side, developing regions, including Africa, with its rapidly growing population and dynamic demographical shifts, will make up the majority of the world’s consumption. And all forms of energy will be needed, not only to support the post-pandemic recovery but to satisfy longer-term energy requirements.

In terms of the downstream sector, the oil demand shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous refinery closures worldwide, including Africa, and we continue to see fallout from this crisis.

However, we forecast 7.3 mb/d of refinery capacity additions in the medium term, mostly in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. Of this, Africa is expected to expand refining capacity by 1.2 mb/d.

In terms of the long-term outlook, we expect to see a total of 15.5 mb/d of refining additions globally, of which 90% will come from the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa.

These overall positive developments in the African downstream will help increase local refined product output while reducing product imports from other regions.

There are also excellent opportunities for enhanced inter-African trade and for increased cooperation among continent’s National Oil Companies in both the downstream and upstream oil and gas sectors.

Additionally, the Declaration and Charter of Cooperation provide excellent opportunities in this regard to help expand partnerships with non-OPEC producers in business, trade, research and development, technology and on other key collaborative efforts.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Despite the many challenges that lay ahead, we will continue to see Africa’s energy industries thrive and grow in the decades to come.

I cannot stress enough the need for enhanced energy cooperation at all levels and amongst all stakeholders.

The Declaration of Cooperation continues to be the torchbearer for multilateral energy cooperation, but I would like to urge all stakeholders here in Africa and around the world to join us as, together, we seek to achieve a lasting stability in the global energy markets. This is the only way we will be able to enable renewed investment in the industry and support the further development of our economies.

I think we all share a common goal in wanting to provide hope and a promising future for the generations to come.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/358-18-october-2022.html"
"2022-09-19","Ladies and gentlemen,

I am honoured to stand before you here today and to carry on the great work that has been done at OPEC. The Organization has been instrumental in supporting a stable and sustainable supply of oil to the world for 62 years and I have no doubt it will continue to do so for many decades to come.

OPEC is a co-sponsor of this influential event, something of which we are very proud. We are grateful to be part of this congregation of great minds.

I want to thank Mr Nader Sultan, the Director of the Oxford Energy Seminar, for his generous invitation to speak today. Mr Sultan was one of my first bosses at the Kuwait Petroleum Company and a personal mentor. He is someone we still look up to in the Kuwaiti oil industry.

I also want to thank Dr Bassam Fattouh, the Director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, who has a long history with OPEC and is often invited to give insightful presentations at OPEC events.

Among the many articles written by Dr Fattouh is a very astute paper and presentation he produced for OPEC’s 60th anniversary two years ago entitled, ‘OPEC at 60: the world with and without OPEC’.

It examines the Organization from an historical perspective over the period 1990 to 2018. His conclusion was that oil supply shocks would have been significantly larger and more persistent if OPEC had not existed.

Additionally, he found that shifts in OPEC oil output policy and the abandonment of its market balancing role would have had global welfare implications.

Ladies and gentlemen,

This seminar was given life by a huge supporter of OPEC, a distinguished academic and renowned energy expert for over four decades, the late Professor Robert Mabro. Professor Mabro was a learned founder of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, which he set up in 1982.

Prior to that, in 1978, he established the Oxford Energy Seminar. Today, it is an essential international energy forum that continues to attract high-calibre international energy experts, like yourselves, to discuss topical issues.

Both Professors have been beneficiaries of distinct OPEC awards: Professor Mabro was the first recipient of the OPEC Award in 2004, while Dr Fattouh received the OPEC Award for Research in 2018. The awards honour distinguished individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to knowledge of the petroleum industry and oil-related issues.

Both men also appear in articles in a 2006 OPEC-sponsored book entitled Oil in the 21st Century, edited by Professor Mabro. The book expounds at length on elements that are still critical today – dialogue, investment and sustainable development. Environment, climate change and renewable energy are also among the topics critically analyzed in the book.

Indeed, these topics have been on the agenda – and on OPEC’s radar – for a very long time. The book also sheds light on how things have progressed in 16 years. For example, it talks about the importance of the dialogues with the EU and China that were initiated at the time.

OPEC’s dialogues have intensified significantly since then and we have brought in many new dialogue partners. Besides the EU and China, regular talks now take place between various consumers and producers including Russia; India; Africa; and US independent producers.

In addition, there are regular meetings with other organizations such as the Gas Exporting Countries Forum; the International Energy Agency; the International Energy Forum; the African Energy Commission; African Petroleum Producers Organization; the International Monetary Fund/World Bank; the Vienna Energy Club; and the G20.

This does not include the extensive list of academics, researchers and analysts who are involved in OPEC dialogues. OPEC is also involved in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process and speaks at the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) sessions.

In this vein, since the adoption of OPEC’s first resolution at the inaugural Meeting of the OPEC Conference on September 14, 1960, dialogue has been front and centre.

It was this rich dialogue that helped OPEC through the Declaration of Cooperation and its non-OPEC partners rescue the oil industry from a severe downturn in 2014–2016, and once again, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I have been asked to speak to you under the title: OPEC within the Global Energy Transition. This is a huge topic of the day, which I will do my best to address in the time that I have.

Humankind has seen several energy transitions over the past 200 years. Before 1800, prior to the Industrial Revolution, humans relied mainly on biomass for heat, along with muscle power for kinetic energy.

Next came the first commercial oil in 1859 in the US state of Pennsylvania. After that, in around 1930, coal usage increased, with the expansion of steam power and coal-fired plants.

Then oil demand surged around 1960 as the use of gasoline vehicles dramatically rose, and by 1970 it accounted for 40 % of global energy consumption. Finally, by 2020, fossil fuels alone accounted for nearly 80 % of the global energy mix. The increasing use of oil led to developmental leaps and bounds.

Each shift was driven by technological innovation – the steam engine, oil lamps, internal combustion engines and the wide-scale use of electricity are just a few examples.

Today’s energy transition has a different root, however. It stems from the realization that we must avoid the catastrophic effects of climate change, which requires a reduction in the release of greenhouse gases (GHG).

Ladies and gentlemen,

I think it important at this point to mention OPEC’s mission, which includes: “...to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its Member Countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry.”

Everything we do, every action we take, comes back to this one succinct statement. And, simply put, this will form the basis of how we tackle the energy transition. OPEC has proven itself over the past 62 years to be a rock solid, reliable, inclusive and active energy partner.

We will continue to maintain this focus on stability going forward.

I want to add that there is no set definition of the term ‘energy transition’. There will be many different viewpoints as to what it actually means: for developed and developing countries, for those who have access to energy, and those who currently do not.

However, what is clear is that this energy transition is unprecedented in both its speed and scale. We do not know how it will play out, but we must avoid a ‘disorderly transition’. Current volatility on the oil market is an indication that more needs to be done.

Movements by financial institutions to limit and stringently control how money is invested into fossil fuels under environmental, social and governance (ESG) constraints will exacerbate this situation. The solution we see is investment not only into renewables, but also into making fossil fuels more ‘green’.

Because one thing is clear to OPEC – all forms of energy will be needed to meet growing demand. According to our preliminary numbers for the upcoming World Oil Outlook, total primary energy demand is set to rise by a strong 23% in the period from 2021 to

2045, or 28%, if we consider 2020 as a baseline.

Although ‘other renewables’, including mainly solar, wind and geothermal energy, see the largest growth leading to a share of over 11% by this time, oil is expected to retain the largest share of the energy mix, accounting for around 29% by 2045.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me add here that there are no climate deniers at OPEC. We do not view renewable energies as an opponent or a threat. We embrace them. Many of our Member Countries are international leaders in renewables.

For example, new and announced hydrogen projects are taking place in five OPEC Member Countries, including in Africa with the establishment of the African Hydrogen Partnership to expand the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier. OPEC Member Countries Angola and Nigeria are partnering with the German government to develop their hydrogen potential.

OPEC Members currently have four carbon capture and storage facilities with a combined capacity of 3.3 million tonnes per annum, with more under development and announced. Nigeria will work with the World Bank to develop a domestic market for carbon capture utilization and storage.

Saudi Arabia has been directing the Saudi Green Initiative, which saw 60 initiatives announced in 2021, representing investment of 158 billion British pounds [SAR 700 billion] towards the growth of the green economy. Their vision includes development of a circular carbon economy, which has been endorsed by the G20.

The UAE is a pioneer in energy diversification, launching some of the world’s most innovative solar, wind and waste-to-energy projects. Record-breaking bids in renewable energy auctions in the UAE and Saudi Arabia have made solar power cost-competitive with conventional energy technologies.

Kuwait has massive solar and wind energy potential and the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) recently launched solar energy initiatives to generate 1,500 MW of energy. It envisages securing 23% of oil sector energy needs from solar power in the first year of operation. Algeria is also expecting to have 1 GW of solar power available in the next year or two.

Not only do these initiatives combat climate change, they allow us to free up oil molecules that can be used for the international market.

Ladies and gentlemen,

No one is better placed to help find solutions to climate change than the oil industry. We have the know-how, the manpower and decades of experience. When we all work together, we can create a smooth energy transition and support leading innovation in eliminating greenhouse gases from all energy sources.

Finally, the energy transition is about more than decarbonization. Energy poverty is a leading tragedy in the world today. It hinders development, increases the need to burn undesirable biomass as a fuel and can increase the risk of geopolitical tension.

The eradication of energy poverty would enable the achievement of many other UN Sustainable Development Goals, including those related to climate action. About 734 million of our brothers and sisters on this planet are without access to electricity – around 77% of whom are in sub-Saharan Africa – an issue that was exacerbated by the pandemic.

Further, about 2.4 billion people lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. Decision-making must be done in an inclusive and fair manner. It should take into account the principles of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in particular those of historical responsibility and common-but-differentiated responsibilities.

Ladies and gentlemen,

My final word will be on investment. Our upcoming World Oil Outlook shows cumulative oil-related investment requirements amount to almost $12.1 trillion in the 2021–2045 period. Of this, nearly 80%, or $9.5 trillion is needed in the upstream. We are falling far, far short of this.

In recent years, we have been disheartened to hear calls from some to limit or stop funding for new oil and gas projects. However, over the past year we have been encouraged by the change in tone of many energy stakeholders and institutions that are now recognizing the critical importance of a stable and sustainable supply of oil to the world’s future energy security.

Related to this, I would point out that a recent survey by the World Energy Council shows world leaders are increasingly sceptical about a rapid transition in light of today’s global energy challenges. Such viewpoints reinforce the urgent need for enhanced global cooperation to achieve an orderly transition based on energy security, affordability and sustainability. We hope these changing attitudes will lead to more desperately needed investment in the oil industry around the world, in order to sustain energy security down the road. For how are we to meet the energy needs of tomorrow if we do not invest today? A lack of investment today in our industry could lead to catastrophic energy shortages in the future.

I want to point out here that we are already reaching critically low spare capacity, due to chronic underinvestment. This plays a huge role in the market volatility we are currently witnessing – exacerbated by geopolitical developments. We live in a world that has become increasingly energy interdependent and this will no doubt be a colossal feature of the global energy transition. It is a world that requires a balanced focus on energy affordability, energy security and reducing emissions.

Yes, there are challenges in the future. And yes, we only have one planet. We all have to do our part to conserve energy and combat climate change for the sake of future generations. The best way to do this is to support an energy transition that utilizes all energies, keeps energy affordable and abundant, and which considers the equality of all people at its core.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/357-19-september-2022.html"
"2022-09-14","It is my great honour and privilege to be in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. To His Excellency, Nicolas Maduro, President of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and to all involved in making this mission possible, I would like to sincerely thank you for the depth of welcome, your warm words and the gracious hospitality.

There are few places on earth like Venezuela. This is a breathtakingly beautiful country, with diverse landscape and terrain. A land that straddles the Andes Mountains, the Caribbean, the Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic Ocean. As the great song tells us, this is the land of ‘desert, jungle, snow, and volcano.’ It is the land of the of the world’s highest uninterrupted waterfall in Angel Falls in Canaima National Park.

And yet, for its abundance of natural assets, undoubtedly, the greatest resource you have is the heroic, welcoming and kind-hearted people of Venezuela. I am delighted to be in your country, which I consider my second home.

I would like to send my warmest regards and best wishes to President Maduro.

President Maduro, you continue to provide inspirational leadership in your support of OPEC and the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process. Under this process, OPEC works with ten non- OPEC producing countries in concerted effort to accelerate the stabilization of the global oil market. This unique forum was born as a result of the severe market imbalance in 2014– 2016, which necessitated a cooperative ethos among the producing countries of the world, something that President Maduro spearheaded and championed. You have provided our market stabilization efforts with a gravitas by engaging with your counterparts at the head of state and government levels.

It was a personal privilege to see your statesmanship first-hand when you visited my home country, the State of Kuwait, as part of your international tour of our region in June this year. You took the time out of your busy schedule to speak with me and I found your wisdom, counsel and supportive words extremely encouraging. It is heartening to know that as Secretary General, I can count on you as an advocate and supporter for our cooperative endeavours.

This was vital during one of the most challenging periods in the history of the oil industry – April 2020.

This was a difficult period caused by the unprecedented contraction in global oil demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the world economy contracted by 3.5% year-over-year in 2020, global oil demand declined by over 9 mb/d. During the month of April 2020, oil demand dropped by a staggering 22 mb/d.

Additionally, the industry in Venezuela faced the challenge of sanctions. These were two tremendous challenges: the COVID-19 pandemic and sanctions.

Ably led by President Maduro, in the face of this adversity, as they have always done in their history, the Venezuelan people have shown their resilience and mettle.

Furthermore, at the 9th and 10th (Extraordinary) Meetings of the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings held on 9 and 12 April 2020, OPEC and its partners in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ decided to implement the largest and longest lasting production adjustments in the history of the oil industry. In forging consensus among the participating countries, in retaining the partners’ sense of togetherness, in ensuring commitments were backed up with action, Venezuela played a critical and positive role.

Since the original inception of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation,’ in 2016, Venezuela has been a member of our monitoring mechanism, the ‘Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee’ Venezuela has played a vital role in ensuring this Committee fulfils its mandate and proactively responds to market conditions as they evolve. And of course, Venezuela’s active contribution to our Organization’s betterment does not stop there.

I am delighted that we are joined by Dr Alvaro Silva Calderon, who served as OPEC Secretary General between 2002 and 2003. OPEC is determined to honour its heritage and learn from the wisdom of previous Secretaries General, each of whom left their own mark in shaping OPEC into the Organization it is today. A few weeks ago, the OPEC Secretariat staff wished an OPEC legend, former Secretary General, Dr Subroto, a happy 99th birthday.

Dr Calderon is another OPEC legend. He has had an outstanding career dedicated to his country, our industry and OPEC. Dr Calderon was a member of the advisory team of Dr Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo, one of our Organization’s founding fathers. Staff at the Secretariat speak extremely warmly of the support and encouragement they received during his tenure

On behalf of OPEC, I would like to thank Dr Calderon for his service to our Organization. Congratulations on receiving your well-earned Honorary Doctorate from the Venezuelan University of Hydrocarbons. It is a fitting tribute to your lifetime of service.

OPEC is truly a family and I am delighted that we are joined by Ambassadors from our Member Countries accredited to Venezuela, and Ambassadors from countries participating in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation.’ Excellencies, your presence today speaks volumes about our unique OPEC Family and the depth of goodwill between our countries.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Today we are commemorating the 62nd Anniversary of OPEC’s founding. Between the 10 and 14 September 1960, Dr Fuad Rouhani of Iran; Dr Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq; Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait; Abdullah Al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia; and Dr Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo of Venezuela descended on the Al-Shaab Hall in Baghdad, Iraq. At this conference, OPEC came into existence. As Dr Perez Alfonso said following the meeting: “We are now united. We are making history.” And indeed, together, we continue to make history.

Venezuela, as a Founder Member of our Organization, has played a unique role in OPEC’s evolution and successes over the course of the last 62 years. The land of Simon Bolivar has infused our Organization with some of the great liberator’s most treasured principles: cooperation among nations, unity and respect for national sovereignty.

Many critical events in the history of OPEC took place in this great city. The second meeting of the OPEC Conference took place in Caracas between 15 and 21 January 1961. At this meeting, the OPEC Statute, which established the structure and functions of the Organization was finalized and approved. This document has stood the test of time, as OPEC’s mission is as relevant in 2022 as it was in 1961.

In the year 2000, when our Organization needed to articulate its vision to meet the challenges of a new millennium, once again, Venezuela would come to the fore. This was due to the remarkable determination and skill of the late, great former President of Venezuela, Commander Hugo Chavez, whose enduring legacy for OPEC continues to be felt to this day.

Between 27 and 28 September 2000, the Second Summit of Heads of State and Government of OPEC Member Countries took place in this great city.

The significance of the event was enhanced by the concluding Second Solemn Declaration that accommodated new challenges within the context of the Organization’s original mission and vision. This included addressing issues such as environmentalism, broadening the concept of economic development to include sustainability and placing a heavy emphasis on eradicating energy poverty.

Ladies and gentleman,

We can collectively be proud of OPEC; actions our Organization has taken have contributed to economic growth, benefitted producers and consumers, and improved the livelihoods of millions. But despite these achievements, the clearest message I have today is this: our Organization’s best days lie ahead of it.

Of course, the industry faces challenges, both in the immediate and longer terms. The global economy is still recovering from the aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet there are many positive signals. According to OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), world economic growth is expected to constitute 3.1 % in 2022 and 2023. World oil demand is still expected to show healthy growth of 3.1 mb/d in 2022 and 2.7 mb/d in 2023.

On the supply side, geopolitical developments in Europe and in other regions continue to have an impact on the efficient functioning of the market. This is particularly the case with regard to restrictions imposed on the flow of crude oil and petroleum products. Such restrictions are harmful to both producers and consumers.

What the market can take comfort from is the fact that OPEC and the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ Participating Countries have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to pursue our goal of sustainable oil market stability. This was evident just last week at the 32nd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting. This body remains ready to meet at short notice to address any market developments, if necessary. This provides our endeavours with a level of flexibility and adaptability.

Looking further ahead, according to OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO), the global population is expected to increase by around 1.7 billion between 2021 and 2045, from 7.8 billion to 9.5 billion. The global economy in 2045 will be more than double the size it was in 2021. With more people and more incomes, there will be a concurrent rise in global energy demand, which is set to increase from around 286 mboe/d in 2021 to 351 mboe/d by 2045.

Global oil demand is expected to increase by close to 13 mb/d to reach close to 110 mb/d by 2045.

I highlight these numbers to show how challenging meeting the energy needs of the future will be. And it is clear, with the world’s largest proven crude oil reserves at 303 billion barrels, Venezuela, will be critical to meeting that challenge head on. I cannot stress this strongly enough: Venezuela has a critical role to play in our energy future.

Ours is an investment intensive industry, yet it currently suffers from chronic underinvestment. This is concerning as natural decline rates in our industry average approximately 5% annually. In the WOO, we see the global oil sector needing cumulative investments of around $12 trillion in the upstream, midstream and downstream through to 2045. These investments are essential for both producers and consumers. I use this opportunity to repeat OPEC’s call for more investments across the entire value chain.

Additionally, underinvestment does not support our common objective of eradicating energy poverty. It is a sad reality that currently, over 700 million people have no access to electricity and 2.4 billion people still use inefficient and polluting systems. Despite the progress achieved under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 7 which seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, without adequate investments in the energy industry, we are falling behind.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The oil resources of this world are not the private domain of one country or group of countries. They belong to the peoples of the world who have the right to access the benefits that come from oil in a responsible and sustainable manner. Producing countries, like our Member Countries, are the custodians of these precious gifts. It is up to us to nurture them for the benefit of all. It is a service we provide to the global community.

And this service is best provided when we have an efficiently functioning global oil market. The alternative is volatility, which is harmful for everyone, be they consumer or producer. At OPEC, we firmly believe that Venezuela must be part of that efficiently functioning market. Our Organization has benefitted enormously from your Membership and will continue to do so in the future.

The anniversary of our Organization’s founding is an opportunity to reaffirm the unique and unbreakable bonds of friendship between OPEC and Venezuela. The benefits of this relationship are not merely confined to the realm of energy. One of the great advantages of OPEC is the friendships forged between countries, the cultural exchange and the celebration of heritage. Venezuela is a land of music and music lovers. It has been a great privilege to hear the outstanding musical talents and gifts of students from ‘El Sistema.’ Their beautiful performance encapsulates the great affection I feel for your country.

Again, my thanks to President Maduro, and the people of Venezuela for this very generous welcome.

"2022-07-05","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is very refreshing, indeed a great pleasure to be back home and to join the NOG in person for the first time since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sharing this important platform with such a distinguished line-up of speakers, and seeing so many old friends, fellow comrades and familiar faces, is a special privilege.

We owe a debt of gratitude to the organizers of NOG, Odiri Umusu of DMG and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Ltd, along with all those who have worked so hard to make the NOG Conference and Exhibition one of the premier events on Nigeria’s energy calendar. Allow me to pay tribute to the founders of the NOG – late Dr. Rilwanu Lukman and Dr. Allirio Parra, both of blessed memory, and congratulate the Organizers for keeping their legacy alive.

Today, I would like to talk about some of the funding challenges facing our industry here in Africa and globally, as well as examine a few of the policy issues affecting investment in the sector.

Before I do so, I would like to draw your kind attention to a couple of important milestones in Nigeria’s recent history. One year ago this month, the Petroleum Industry Bill was adopted by both houses of the 9th National Assembly and signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. This was a ground-breaking achievement, culminating many long years of hard work. I am confident that the implementation of the law will help unlock the full potential of our petroleum industry, strengthen its ability to attract long-term investment, as well as support a dynamic and diverse economy.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

If our NOCs are to continue to innovate and flourish, it is of utmost importance that they have predictable and unfettered access to investment capital. Regular Investment at adequate levels is the lifeblood of our industry. It is essential if we are to develop new technologies, strengthen our human capacity and remain leaders in innovation so that we can do our part to meet the world’s growing need for energy, shrink our overall environmental footprint, and expand access to underserved communities.

Yet our industry is now facing huge challenges along multiple fronts, and these threaten our investment potential now and in the longer term. To put it bluntly, the oil and gas industry is under siege!

For starters, the evolving geopolitical developments in Eastern Europe, the ongoing war in Ukraine, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary pressures across the globe have come together in a perfect storm that is causing significant volatility and uncertainty in the commodity markets and, more importantly, in the world of energy.

Against this backdrop, a number of industrialized countries and multilateral institutions continue to pursue stringent policies aimed at accelerating the energy transition and fundamentally altering the energy mix.

Putting these issues aside for a moment, we must not forget that our industry is still reeling from the enormous investment losses of recent years.

In a very short timespan, the industry has been hit by two major cycles – the severe market downturn in 2015 and 2016, and the even more far-reaching impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2020, the first year of the pandemic and one of the darkest periods in the history of oil, upstream oil capital expenditure fell by around 30%. This exceeded the colossal 26% annual declines experienced during the severe industry downturn in 2015 and 2016.

Looking further down the road, OPEC’s most recent World Oil Outlook gives us some perspective on what is to come. It shows the global oil sector will need cumulative investments of $11.8 trillion in the upstream, midstream and downstream through to 2045 to meet expectations for significant growth in energy demand.

With regard to demand, there is only one direction, and that is up. In fact, OPEC projects that total primary energy demand will expand by a robust 28% in the period to 2045. Oil is expected to retain the largest share of the energy mix, accounting for just over a 28% share in 2045, followed by gas at around 24%. In other words, oil and gas together will continue to supply more than half of the world’s energy needs for many decades. These hydrocarbons are especially vital to the energy mix in regions like Africa, which will see massive population shifts and economic growth in the coming years. These developments increase the urgency of eradicating energy poverty.

The impacts of the two major market cycles are manifesting themselves in real time.

Years of underinvestment in the oil sector help explain the current market tightness and razor-thin spare capacity margins.

In OPEC’s 62-year history, spare capacity has never been as low as it is today, and this takes into account periods of war, natural disaster and other market shocks. If this trend continues, it could haunt us in the future.

We could, however, unlock resources and strengthen capacity if the oil produced by the Islamic Republic of Iran and Venezuela were allowed to return to the market. As we know, their oil industries have been held hostage by geopolitics, while Libya has faced internal challenges that have at times sharply curbed its exports. Unfortunately, the disruptions affecting these three OPEC Member Countries not only contribute to the current market tightness, they directly affect the welfare and development of these great nations.

Here, it is also important to remember that it takes time to return to normal operations and restore production capacity. This is especially the case in countries that have had to endure restrictions on investment and exports, and following severe market shocks like we saw in 2020. As we all know, you cannot turn a tap and solve the world’s oil needs overnight; it takes time, technology, logistics and capital.

Reading the daily news feed, the upstream has become a favourite scapegoat for the current market conditions. However, this discounts the current capacity challenges that also plague the downstream, especially with regard to transportation fuels. Refinery closures in recent years – coupled with a number of untimely accidents at important regional refineries – have curtailed supplies and helped fuel the energy market volatility of recent months.

OPEC’s 2022 Annual Statistical Bulletin, which was published last week, helps shed light on the situation. Worldwide refinery capacity fell by more than 330,000 barrels per calendar day year-on-year in 2020 and remained below pre-pandemic levels last year despite the robust global economic rebound. The Middle East, China, as well as Africa and India, have recorded refining capacity additions. However, refinery capacity in the OECD declined for the third consecutive year in 2021. Comparing the pre-pandemic year of 2019 to 2021, OECD refining capacity fell by a significant 1.5 million barrels per calendar day, or 3.3%. Given the global refining squeeze at the moment, the construction of the Dangote refinery in Lagos, with its capacity of around 650,000 barrels per day, is a huge step in the direction of addressing not only Nigeria’s longer-term demand – but significantly improving the capacity outlook of the global down-stream sector.

The urgent need to ensure predictable investment is one reason OPEC joined hands with a number of key non-OPEC oil-producing countries in the Declaration of Cooperation back in December of 2016. With our combined expertise and experience to guide us, the participating countries were able to move quickly and decisively to address the widening market crisis at the onset of COVID-19. Rarely in the history of our industry have we witnessed such far-reaching efforts to restore sustainable stability to the global oil market, which in turn has been vital to the global economic recovery.

Let me stress here that many African producing countries, both OPEC and non-OPEC Members, have been instrumental in supporting the framework Declaration of Cooperation from the start. These efforts have not gone unnoticed by policymakers, energy analysts and some of the leading stakeholders in the international oil industry. We remain optimistic these market-stabilization efforts will extend beyond the Declaration of Cooperation’s current production adjustment schedule, which is due to expire at the end of August, particularly taking into consideration the persistent volatility and enormous uncertainties in the market. Last week’s important OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, which by the way was the 30th held since the beginning of the DoC, demonstrated once again the commitment of our participating countries to remain resolutely focused on oil market stability and supporting the global economy.

OPEC is a unique Organization and has always dedicated itself to cooperation and teamwork regardless of the geopolitical landscape.

We have drawn on this experience to support the growth and stability of the global oil market by continually expanding data exchanges, technical capacity and high-level cooperation with many leading oil-consuming countries, producers and institutions. Our first High-level Meeting of the OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue took place last year, marking a major milestone in our collaboration with like-minded organizations across this great continent.

These efforts to build strong sustainable relationships are proving their worth. Over the longer term, we believe these Dialogues will facilitate the sharing of experiences, lessons learnt and best practices to support efforts for an inclusive and sustainable way forward.

Regrettably, we are seeing global energy cooperation becoming more fragmented.

New regional alignments are threatening to reverse years of progress towards creating a more stable and interconnected energy system. We cannot afford to allow multilateral energy cooperation and global energy security become collateral damage of geopolitics.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

As many of you know, I have been involved in the global climate negotiations since their inception three decades ago, representing Nigeria in the early years and more recently OPEC. The past negotiating sessions were never easy. However, there was always space around the table for multiple viewpoints to be heard and consensual outcomes to be found.

Unfortunately, the policy narrative in the run-up to and during COP26 last year in Glasgow, UK was heavily distorted against hydrocarbons and divorced from the reality of the world’s energy needs. Developing countries were urged to turn their backs on their own hydrocarbon assets, even though their right to sovereignty over the use of these natural resources is carved in the Paris Agreement’s principle of equity in the context of sustainable development.

Efforts to unwisely encourage divestment in the hydrocarbon industries are unfortunately becoming more pronounced. Last month, UN Secretary-General António Guterres suggested in remarks at a White House-sponsored event that our industry is ignoring its responsibility to address the climate change challenge and is undermining global climate policies.

Such misleading pronouncements are terribly unfair to many of us in this industry who have dedicated ourselves to working towards inclusive, just and sustainable solutions to the climate challenge. In fact, key stakeholders in the industry are participating in the intergovernmental arrangements and initiatives to develop, deploy and promote cutting-edge technologies to reduce emissions from the production and consumption of energy.

Furthermore, I would respectfully point out that the G7 countries only a few weeks ago called on energy-exporting countries to increase oil production and acknowledged the critical role of OPEC in this regard.

Then at last week’s G7 Summit in Germany, the leaders took a step in the right direction by recognizing the need for continued investment in fossil fuels to help meet the world’s energy needs. It is imperative that they translate these words into policy actions that affirm the importance of a broad portfolio of energy options, including oil and gas, and support an investment climate that makes this possible.

Inopportune remarks and efforts to discourage oil exploration and development are bound to sow the seeds of a more pronounced energy crisis and undermine global energy security. Moreover, they jeopardize efforts to achieve universal, reliable and affordable energy access for people across the globe, including those in developing countries.

Both the market and consumers deserve clear and consistent policies which recognize that oil is indispensable to global economic development and the world’s energy mix. Our industry cannot afford to sleepwalk into another crisis. It is of utmost importance that we seize opportunities to encourage world leaders to return to the roots and principles of the Paris Agreement. This means focusing on inclusive, Party-driven negotiations and decision-making based on the science and data, not emotions and rhetoric.

COP27, which will take place in Egypt later this year, offers a prime opportunity for developing nations, including those producing oil and gas, to make our voices heard. This is a chance to return to a balanced and holistic process to address critical issues such as adaptation, mitigation and the means of implementation, especially climate finance and technology.

Furthermore, COP27 provides a platform to reaffirm the importance of multilateralism and mutual respect among nations. These principles are pillars of OPEC’s own success dating back to its founding in 1960 in Baghdad, Iraq.

We also need more cooperation and financial firepower when it comes to tackling energy poverty. Globally, more than 750 million people lack reliable electricity. A further 2.6 billion do not have safe and clean fuels and technologies for cooking and heating. In Sub-Saharan Africa, OPEC data show that an estimated 47% of people have no electricity and approximately 85% lack access to clean cooking and heating fuels. Considering the enormous energy resources available on this continent, this is simply hard to accept.

At OPEC, we are committed to expand energy access and help achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Many of our Member Countries are already taking a lead in developing and deploying innovative technologies that can help ensure a stable and sustainable energy supply for all. We are proud that our sister Organization, the OPEC Fund for International Development, has helped finance energy projects across the global south since it was set up by OPEC Member Countries, including Nigeria in 1976.

Each step we take to improve energy access is a step in the right direction, but we need all forms of energy to reach our destination. As Nelson Mandela once said, ""You can start changing our world for the better daily, no matter how small the action.""

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

When I first became Nigeria’s delegate to OPEC in 1986, little did I know that I would end up as its Secretary General 30 years later. I will forever be grateful to President Muhammadu Buhari for sending me to OPEC to serve as its 28th Secretary General. It has been gratifying to enjoy his full support, advice and guidance throughout my tenure, during which time I drank from his fountain of wisdom and reservoir of knowledge of OPEC. Muhammadu Buhari is the only current President in the world to have served as Minister of Petroleum and Head of delegation to the Organization.

Serving as Secretary General of OPEC for two terms has been the honour of a lifetime. Over the past six years, we have witnessed both challenging and historic moments, which have underscored time and again the importance of cooperation and teamwork. It has also been a source of pride to see African oil-producing countries becoming more prominent on the global energy stage, not only in OPEC, but through organizations like the Gas Exporting Countries Forum and International Energy Forum with whom we share many members in common.

Together with my very able colleagues at the Secretariat in Vienna, our Member Countries and those in the Declaration of Cooperation framework, we have turned a historic page and wrote several glorious chapters of our industry in the last six years.

At the end of this month, I will hand over the baton as Secretary General to my brother and friend Haitham Al-Ghais of the State of Kuwait. He is a seasoned veteran of the oil industry and an astute diplomat who has dedicated himself to OPEC for many years.

As we move on to a new chapter, we can take comfort in knowing that OPEC and its Member Countries will continue to devote themselves to the core principles of the Organization’s statute: supporting a stable and secure energy future for the benefit of producers, consumers and the global economy. The best is yet to come for OPEC, for Nigeria, and for this great industry.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/6-05-july-2022.html"
"2022-06-19","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great privilege to launch the special book commissioned for the 60th Anniversary of OPEC’s founding; a book entitled: ‘OPEC 60 Years and Beyond: A Story of Courage, Cooperation and Commitment.’ For Iraq, and the city of Baghdad in particular, we are delighted to be the site of the launch of this book.

Of course, this is only fitting, for it was here, almost 62 years ago, between the 10th and 14th of September 1960, representatives from five courageous oil producing countries descended on Al-Shaab Hall in the Bab Al-Muaatham district in Baghdad: Fuad Rouhani of Iran; Dr. Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq; Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait; Abdullah Al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia; and Dr. Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo of Venezuela. As a result of the actions of these five founding fathers, visionary leaders of our Member Countries, OPEC came into existence.

To commemorate this history, the Iraqi government has graciously renovated the Al-Shaab Hall to preserve and honour its unique history.

The fact that our country is the birthplace of OPEC is an enormous source of pride for all Iraqis. We are proud of our role as a Founder Member; as a constructive force throughout the Organization’s history; a consensus forger and bridge builder. We are pleased that the Iraqi Government has sponsored this book and hope it will be a useful reference tool for future generations who seek to acquaint themselves better with our Organization.

One clear conclusion from this terrific book is that Iraq has continued to play an active role in furthering the Organization’s aims and promoting sustainable oil market stability for over six decades. OPEC has been greatly enriched by the dedication and contribution of a succession of dedicated and talented Iraqi public servants, Ministers, Governors, National Representatives, and OPEC Staff Members. They have represented our Organization and our country in the best possible light.

Iraq has been particularly supportive of OPEC’s market stabilization efforts through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process, signed on 10 December 2016, which has seen OPEC join hands with 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries as they work together towards a balanced oil market. This commitment has risen to new heights in 2019, as Iraq became a member of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee. It is one of my duties as Iraq’s Head of Delegation to OPEC, to represent our country at this committee when it meets on a monthly basis.

Iraq has also played a significant role in the endorsement of the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ at the 6th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 2 July 2019. This represents a significant step in the further institutionalization of the successful DoC partnership. Indeed, Iraq was the first country to ratify the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ through its national process.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to congratulate the staff members from the OPEC Secretariat, ably led by HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General, for the outstanding work they have put into this book. This book represents a singular accomplishment. It is meticulously researched, compellingly written and showcases the multitude of accomplishments that our Organization has achieved throughout its history.

All success in life comes as a result of teamwork and I would like to heartily thank the team in doing the Organization a great service in producing this book. It is a service sincerely appreciated by the Member Countries as it provides a one-stop source for information on the remarkable journey that OPEC has been on.

It is indeed one of the final activities of our dear colleague and friend, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo. His Excellency will soon be completing his six year assignment as Secretary General. On behalf of Iraq, I would like to thank him for his outstanding dedication and service. He has navigated the Organization through moments, notably, the severe oil market downturn in 2014-2016 and the demand contraction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Secretary General has made an indelible contribution to the unique format that is ‘the Declaration of Cooperation’ between OPEC and 10 non-OPEC oil-producing countries. Together our nations have worked hand-in-glove to support the oil industry and ensured its survival.

Mr. Barkindo has been a very good friend of Iraq. He has visited our country on a multitude of occasions over the last six years and sought to advance our country’s interests in the Organization. It is particularly pleasing that on his many visits he was able to see some of Iraq’s holy and cultural sites, such as the holy shrines of Najaf and Kerbala, the Masjid al-Kufa, the site of the ancient city of Babylon, adjacent to Hillah, the ancient city of Ur in Nasiriya, and the National Museum of Iraq.

We express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Barkindo and wish him every success in the next chapter of his life.

It is therefore a happy and joyous day; one when we can reflect on OPEC’s history, Iraq’s contribution to that history and the positive role OPEC has played in the oil market and indeed, international affairs for the last sixty years.

Thank you for your kind attention. I would like to hand the floor over to the Secretary General.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/7-19-june-2022.html"
"2022-06-19","Excellences, ladies and gentlemen,

Allow me to transport you back to Baghdad on the 14 September 1960. It was a day when the five Founding Fathers of OPEC, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo of Venezuela; Abdullah al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia; Dr Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq; Dr Fuad Rouhani of Iran; and Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait gathered together in the Al-Shaab Hall in this great city, to midwife OPEC into the world.

This seminal event, known as the historic ‘Baghdad Conference’, saw these five visionaries from our Founder Member Countries gathered together around the premise of cooperation and with the need to write their own story. Pérez Alfonzo said after the meeting: “We are now united. We are making history.”

That history now spans more than six decades, despite some sceptics suggesting that it would last little more than a few years. As an Organization we have come a long way, we have witnessed many ups and downs, we have seen seven major market cycles, including the latest in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have evolved as an integral part of the international energy community, and we have seen reams of column inches written about OPEC.

It is important to stress that in terms of OPEC’s history, the Organization is far more than just an appendage to the history of oil. It is a story of a family of nations, of people and populations, of feelings and emotions of countries rich in culture and heritage, and of the struggle of a group of developing countries to exercise the inalienable right of all countries to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources in the interest of their national development.

Towards the end of 2019, as we looked at OPEC’s impending 60th anniversary in September 2020, we decided to embark on telling this story. Putting words on paper, to document the first 60 years and bring OPEC’s history to a wider readership.

Our initial preparations for this was in the time before COVID-19! The original plan was to launch it in Baghdad to celebrate OPEC’s 60th anniversary, and while the book was ready, the pandemic put paid to its unveiling in September 2020.

However, I am extremely happy that we have the opportunity to officially launch it today, with the help of the Iraqi Government, and specifically Iraq’s Minister of Oil, His Excellency Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael, and his able team at the Ministry.

We could not have done this without Iraq’s help. Your generous commitment to this project, your support for the anniversary celebrations, and your continued backing for OPEC, deserve a round of applause.

Thank you, Your Excellency.

The book, titled ‘OPEC 60 years and beyond: A story of courage, cooperation and commitment’, consists of two main parts.

Part One chronicles the history of the Organization, starting with the build-up to OPEC’s creation on 14 September 1960 and up to its 60th Anniversary.

Part Two looks more deeply into specific cross cutting issues, to further explore what the Organization stands for and where it is heading, including chapters on dialogues, OPEC seminars, development, OPEC and its host country Austria, and the environment.

As the book highlights, the history of OPEC underscores the adversities the Organization has faced, the challenges overcome, the achievements made, and the value placed on dialogue and cooperation with other industry stakeholders, including both producers and consumers.

Surviving 60 years is a monumental achievement in and of itself for such an organization, but especially so for one representing one of the most volatile commodities – oil.

We hope this book will prove of interest and value to readers of every persuasion wishing to learn more about our Organization and its Member Countries, whether they be from within the industry itself, the world of academia, the media or other walks of life.

I should like to thank all those who have been directly involved in preparing this book, particularly Hasan Hafidh, Head of OPEC’s Public Relations Department and Editor-in-Chief of the publication, and the two main authors, James Griffin and Mathew Quinn.

As Chairman of the Editorial Board of the book, I was regularly updated on how the book was progressing, I read it many times before it was published to offer my thoughts, and it is clear to me that it has been both an onerous and an enjoyable task.

It was onerous because of the painstaking research carried out in studying and analyzing 60 years of OPEC’s history, and then collating this and presenting it in an easily digestible form for readers.

At the same time, it was an enjoyable and illuminating experience for the Secretariat, because of the many new insights gained about our Organization, our Member Countries, our objectives, our struggles and our achievements. We hope we have managed to convey these insights successfully to readers.

Alongside the support of Iraq in this project, the biggest gratitude should be reserved for all those people who have contributed to OPEC’s success over its first six decades.

This includes:

The visionary Founding Fathers who set it up and pointed it in the right direction;

The Ministers, Secretary Generals, Governors, National Representatives and other top officials who persevered robustly with asserting Member Countries’ sovereign rights in the early years and then strenuously abided by OPEC’s core values throughout the following years;

The Heads of State and Government whose landmark summits in 1975, 2000 and 2007 revitalized the Organization and permitted a fresh new look at the challenges facing Member Countries; and,

Last but by no means least, the Staff of the Secretariat, whose tireless efforts, enthusiasm and support across a wide range of disciplines have provided a sound base from which OPEC can achieve its aims and aspirations.

I very much hope everyone here enjoys reading the OPEC story.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/8-19-june-2022.html"
"2022-06-08","Friends, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon.

It is an immense pleasure to be back in the hallowed halls and rooms of this great institution.

It has been over three years since I was last here at the Atlantic Council. We all know the reason why. The pandemic truly turned the world upside down, but there is now far more light at the end of the dark tunnel we have been travelling through over the past two plus years.

I would like to thank my friends, Fred Kempe, President and CEO of the Atlantic Council and Randolph Bell, Senior Director and Richard Morningstar Chair for Global Energy Security at the Global Energy Center, as well as everyone at the Council, for inviting me back.

I am also thankful to see so many friends and colleagues here at the luncheon. I appreciate your engagement and I hope to be able to speak to each and every one of you today.

I took up the role of OPEC Secretary General on 1 August 2016. In some ways, it feels like yesterday, but in others, it feels like a lifetime ago given how much the world has changed since then.

Back then, wearing masks in public was frowned upon; the word ‘fake news’ had not gone mainstream; TikTok was something clocks did, rather than a social media phenomenon; and Greta Thunberg was an unheard of schoolgirl in Sweden.

For OPEC and the global oil industry, the last six years have seen major events and developments, but perhaps four stand out.

The first was the development of the Declaration of Cooperation back in 2016, to counter the severe oil market downturn as a result of the global supply imbalance of 2014-2016. The second was the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The third was the renewed prominence geopolitics have taken in the oil market, particularly in 2022. And the fourth was the ever-evolving discourse around the energy transition.

Allow me here to quote from a former British Prime Minister, a half-American one who also developed close relationships with Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. When Harold MacMillan was asked what was the greatest challenge during his time leading the country, he answered:

“Events, dear boy, events.”

It is a quote that strikes a personal chord. It has been some journey as OPEC Secretary General. I consider myself fortunate to have had a front row seat for some of the most momentous milestones in the history of this great Organization.

In looking at the major events of the past six years, perhaps what they all have in common are two things: ‘globalization’ and ‘multilateralism’.

Issues that I know go to the heart of the Atlantic Council.

Certainly, there have been a lot of column inches and boardroom discussions devoted to questions regarding the future of globalization, and indeed, multilateralism.

For example, investment patterns that have dominated the last three decades such as the idea of corporations opting for cheap offshore manufacturing and slick global supply chains holding costs down and keeping inflation levels low are being put to the test.

The deployment of sanctions and attempts to sever some countries from the global economic system has seen geopolitical fractures spill into the economic sphere. It was very interesting to hear the great Dan Yergin, vice chair of S&P Global, at Davos last month saying that he had not seen such a focus on geopolitics in his 25 years of coming to the annual World Economic Forum meeting.

We should not be under any illusion that the attempt to ‘decouple’ economies or reverse globalization is a product of the 2020s. Indeed, it has been a refrain for many politicians over the last ten years or so. Many communities have expressed grievances at missing out on the opportunities that come from globalization, or feel aggrieved by it. This has also fed into a scepticism of multilateralism and the multilateral system.

The reasons for this trend are multifaceted. It obviously includes geopolitics, but the prospect of trade wars between the world’s largest two economies have cast a long shadow over the global economy during the last six years; the unprecedented impacts of the pandemic, including ongoing supply chain disruptions; and anxiety about access to, and the costs of commodities and food, have also made contributions to this sentiment.

The fate of globalization, or at least the globalization in the form that we have known for the last three decades, possible geo-economic fragmentation, as well as the future of multilateralism, has consequences for the oil industry that are extremely complex.

I suspect these issues will dominate this Organization’s work for the foreseeable future.

From a personal viewpoint, at times it feels like the world is at an inflection point, shifting away from global dialogue and cooperation to more restrictive silos. It is vital that we keep channels of communication open, work together, and maintain the multilateral approach to dealing with all global challenges.

In this regard, it has been immensely pleasing over the past six years to witness the evolution of the multilateral Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

It was not an easy task bringing everyone together; it took a great deal of diplomacy, and if I might say, buckets of toil and sweat. The efforts, however, were worth it.

Its collaborative nature, and its comprehensive, adaptable and robust architecture, has allowed us to face a plethora of challenges head-on and navigate the many bumps in then road that have shaken the global economy.

I am proud to recall the way in which participants in the Declaration helped pull the industry back from the brink of catastrophe following the downturn in 2014-2016. It was a monumental effort, but one that helped the industry rise again, like a phoenix from the ashes, and, in turn, had a positive impact on the global economy, and trade worldwide.

Having the Declaration in place also proved extremely beneficial in 2020, when there was a need to react quickly and forcefully in the face of the devastating pandemic.

We can never forget April 2020. Global demand was down by 20 million barrels a day, WTI plummeted into negative territory. These were visceral events, and I personally recall sitting there open mouthed watching on TV how quickly WTI plunged on 20 April.

But the DoC decisions taken in the same month helped right the ship, and set us on a course, albeit slowly, to recovery.

The DoC has over the past six years also been a shelter and a beacon of stability despite any geopolitically-induced turbulence.

The commitment of the DoC to a balanced and sustainable market was evidenced only last week when participants advanced the planned overall production adjustment for September 2022, into July and August. This was quickly welcomed by the US Administration.

The importance of the Declaration has also received backing from other producers, as well as from consumers. April 2020 proved just what can be achieved with the backing of major producers and consumers at the very highest levels of government. We can all recall how this played out here in the US.

With regard to the US, I am also personally gratified to have witnessed the evolution of our cooperation with a variety of US stakeholders over the past six years. I have sat here in Washington with the Atlantic Council, as well as in Abu Dhabi, and opened talks with other US institutions and private sector bodies, as well with the industry, including US independents.

I believe this stands the Organization in good stead; with there now being a clearer understanding among engaged US stakeholders just what OPEC is about.

It is cooperation, and a word I have already highlighted, multilateralism, that will be vital to OPEC’s and the industry’s future.

This is evident when we look at the energy transition.

It is important to recognize there is no one-size-fits all pathway. We need to take an all-options approach, an all-solutions approach, and an all-technologies approach.

At OPEC, we fully believe that the oil and gas industries are part of the solution; they possess vital resources and expertise that can help unlock our emission-free future

We are fully supportive of an energy transition that draws on the strengths of all energy forms, including oil and gas.

The challenges before us are enormous and com­plex. We have been delivered a stark reminder of this with the recent strains and conflicts related to energy affordability, energy security, and the need to reduce emissions playing out in regions across the world at the end of 2021 and into 2022.

Focusing on only one of these issues, while ignor­ing the others, can lead to unintended consequences, such as market distortions, heightened price volatility, and energy shortfalls.

It requires a delicate balancing act, comprehensive and sustainable solutions, and all voices at the table. It is an energy sustainability trilemma, with each piece of the jigsaw having to fit together.

We need to ensure energy is affordable for all; we need to transition to a more inclusive, fair, and equita­ble world in which every person has access to energy as referenced in UN Sustainable Development Goal 7; and we need to reduce emissions. Oil has a role to play in each part.

To put energy demand growth in some context, we see global energy demand rising by 28% in the period by 2045. This clearly requires huge investments.

In the oil industry alone, our World Oil Outlook sees required investments totaling $11.8 trillion through to 2045. These investments are essential for both producers and consumers, particularly given the huge investment drop of 30% seen in 2020.

More energy, more investments are required. However, we also hear conflicting statements on these issues as exhibited most recently by the G7 Ministers of Climate, Energy and the Environment.

They called for oil and gas producing countries, including reference to OPEC, to play a key role in ensuring stable and sustainable global energy supplies, but at the same time committed themselves to end financing for most overseas fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022.

I think there is a saying in English: ‘you can’t have your cake and eat it.’

To put it simply: if investments are not made globally, if the capital does not flow, and at the same time if consumers are still demanding the product, we could see further major energy insecurity in various forms.

Here, we also need to be cognizant of how oil and gas industry investments are being impacted by Environmental Social Governance (ESG) and the climate disclosure drive from the financial community.

The environmental aspect of ESG is perhaps outweighing the need to address social and development issues.

We need to work with all industry stakeholders to ensure an investment friendly climate, with sufficient finance, along with technology research and transfer; one that is sustainable and works for both producers and consumers, and developed and developing countries.

We have no doubt that the resources and exper­tise of the oil industry can be harnessed again to help develop cleaner and more efficient technological solutions, contributing to a reduction of emissions as part of unlocking a low-emissions future.

For exam­ple, carbon capture utilization and storage, including direct air capture, blue hydrogen, and other technol­ogies, can be leveraged – along with the promotion of the Circular Carbon Economy – to improve overall environmental performance.

As I mentioned earlier, we need to follow all the right transition paths and appreciate that there is not just one path for all.

Different countries around the world have varying capabilities, diverse needs and priorities, particularly in relation to equity, historical responsibility and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Thus, reducing emissions has many avenues, as set out by the multilateral Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and we must consider all of them as viable options.

We need to connect all aspects of the energy sustainability trilemma.

Before I conclude, I also want to say how honoured I felt to be named earlier this year in the UAE as a Distinguished Fellow of the Atlantic Council in acknowledgement of my achievements as Secretary General.

Let me stress that this honour is also one that should be dedicated to the tireless efforts of the OPEC Secretariat’s staff members. Their commitment and professionalism are second to none.

I look forward to taking up this fellowship when my tenure ends in August, and I very much hope I can provide thought leadership, and work with your great team, on some of the issues I have broached today.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/9-08-june-2022.html"
"2021-12-16","Mr. President, Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a distinct honour to address the MSGBC Oil, Gas and Power Conference and we send our warmest greetings to all participants and delegates. We commend the wise leadership of HE Macky Sall, President of Senegal, for holding such a forward-looking and innovative conference at what is a critical juncture for the energy industry, not only in Mauritania, Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau and Guinea Conakry, but across the African continent and indeed the globe.

I would like to thank HE Aissatou Sophie Gladima, Minister of Petroleum and Energy, for the gracious invitation to address this distinguished gathering and such an illustrious lineup of speakers, participants and attendees. Our congratulations go to the Minister and her team, the event sponsors and organizers, and all involved who have ensured this is a prestigious and historic event.

It is regretful that due to the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, where the OPEC Secretariat is located, here in Vienna, Austria, I cannot attend the MSGBC conference in person. However, such is the power of the world-famous Senegalese ‘teranga,’ I feel the warmth of your welcome 3,000 miles away here in Vienna.

Senegal is known as the ‘Land of Teranga,’ and while this is sometimes translated into English as ‘hospitality,’ I know first-hand from my Senegalese friends, it means so much more. Teranga is a way of life, defined by a generosity of spirit, an openness and willingness to make everyone feel welcome, regardless of nationality, colour, creed, or class. It unites people, irrespective of their background, around their shared humanity.

Teranga has made Senegal an example to the rest of the world, a bastion of tolerance, good neighbourliness and shared community. At OPEC, we hope that our current efforts with 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries, under the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process, displays similar characteristics of good neighbourliness, respect for diversity and a desire to act as responsible members of the international community.

Signed on 10 December 2016, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between OPEC and 10 non-OPEC Producing Countries is a pioneering framework for multilateral energy cooperation and continues to contribute greatly to the post-pandemic economic recovery as a vital stabilizing force in the global oil industry.

Indeed, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has enabled the oil industry to withstand and recover from both the severe oil market downturn of 2014-2016 and the unprecedented oil market contraction following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The objective of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ can be summarized in just four words: sustainable oil market stability. OPEC does not seek stability for stability’s sake: rather we are acutely conscious of the broader social and economic benefits for all which come as a result of sustainable oil market stability. This is particularly the case for a global economy still reeling from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this context, OPEC full heartedly supports the spirit of cooperation and fraternity among nations that undergirds this conference. Our statute commits us to multilateralism and cooperation with all stakeholders in the energy industry. We recognize that the challenges of our age, require the international community to lift each other up and support each other.

African countries have historically assumed strong, proactive leadership roles in OPEC. Angola currently holds the Presidency of the OPEC Conference and will be succeeded by Congo next year. In September of this year, we celebrated a monumental milestone, the golden anniversary of Nigeria joining OPEC in 1971.

Recent years have seen an expansion of the African presence in our Organization. Congo became a Member Country in 2018, Equatorial Guinea joined in 2017 and Gabon rejoined in 2016.

This consolidates the incredibly positive, constructive and fruitful roles played by Libya since it joined our Organization in 1962, Algeria since 1969, Nigeria since 1971 and Angola since 2006.

Many of the most significant meetings in the 61 year history of our Organization took place in African cities. From the 9th Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Tripoli in 1965, critical meetings and conferences have been held in Algiers (including our first ever Summit), Oran, Lagos, Abuja, Luanda, and Libreville. We hope this expands in the future.

Indeed, the idea for our Organization was conceived in Africa, specifically Egypt. It was at the Cairo Yacht Club in 1959, that the Gentleman’s Agreement was forged which paved the way for the establishment of OPEC in Baghdad in September 1960.

Aside from the African countries who are OPEC members, two African countries have joined the historic “Declaration of Cooperation,” between OPEC and 10 non-OPEC producing countries, namely Sudan and South Sudan. Chad and Uganda declared their support for the DoC process in November 2017.

The strong bonds between OPEC and Africa reflect the critical role that our great continent will play in the future of the energy industry. This is one of the most dominant themes of OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2045. Our flagship publication presents OPEC’s medium to long-term projections for the global economy, oil and energy demand and other factors pertaining to the industry.

The first thing to underscore is that Africa has a young and vibrant population. The Middle East and Africa region is currently experiencing a swift rate of population growth. By 2045, it is forecast to be the leading region by overall population, adding 762 million people in the period 2020-2045.

We anticipate a bright future for Africa's oil industry with substantial opportunities for growth. The continent is home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world and several top gas-producing nations, including Senegal. The world will continue to rely on Africa’s precious resources in the long term in order to meet the rapidly rising global demand for oil and gas.

In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, Africa produced approximately 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around 9% of world output. The continent’s proven oil reserves amounted to around 126 billion barrels at the end of 2019.

In terms of the downstream sector, last year’s oil demand shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous refinery closures worldwide, and we will see additional closures in the coming years.

Looking ahead, from 2021 to 2026, we expect to see around 6.9 mb/d of new refining capacity come online, mostly in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Africa. Africa’s refining capacity is expected to increase by 1.2 mb/d by 2026 from their current levels of 4 mb/d.

Looking longer term to 2045, OPEC forecasts 14 mb/d of capacity additions, mostly in developing countries. In Africa, long-term demand growth will lead to an increase in refinery throughputs of almost 5 mb/d in 2045, up from 2.4 mb/d in 2019.

These overall positive developments in the African downstream will help increase local refined product output while reducing product imports from other regions.

In terms of downstream investment, we estimate a total of roughly $1.5 trillion will be spent during the period 2021-2045. $450 billion of this will be invested in new refinery projects and expansions of existing units. Most of these projects will be located in developing countries, including Africa.

Indeed, the importance of creating an investment-enabling environment is a further key conclusion from the WOO. Cumulative oil-related investment requirements amount to $11.8 trillion in the 2021-2045 period. Of this, 80%, or $9.2 trillion is in the upstream, with another $1.5 and $1.1 trillion needed in the downstream and midstream, respectively. And creating an investment friendly climate through oil market stability has been one of the objectives of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between OPEC and 10 non-OPEC producing countries.

We need to be cognizant of how oil and gas industry investments are being impacted by Environmental Social Governance (ESG) requirements and the climate disclosure drive from the financial community. We are concerned about the ESG footprint and stranded asset risk of the industry. The environmental aspect of ESG is perhaps outweighing the need to address the social and development issues. We need to work with all industry stakeholders to ensure an investment friendly climate, one that is sustainable and works for both producers and consumers.

Access to capital is particularly significant given the twin challenges of sustainable development and climate change, two sides of the same coin. This was a point OPEC raised at the COP26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland.

The COP26 negotiations were tense at times, but in the end, all Parties reiterated their commitment to the implementation and full operationalization of the Paris Agreement.

This was a positive step, giving the pressing need to reduce global emissions, alleviate energy poverty, counter the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and find a sustainable way forward that leaves no one behind.

However, as we all know the public discourse around energy, climate and sustainable development continues to be extremely emotive. This was evident in Glasgow, with some voices all but excluded, including many from our own petroleum industry.

At times, the narrative around the energy transition has been overtaken by emotional outbursts, with rational discussions based on facts, hard data and science, taking a back seat.

The parameters of the public discourse seem reduced to the question: are you for, or against fossil fuels? It is perhaps the ultimate false dichotomy.

It erroneously constrains what options are available. It should not be a question about ‘one or the other’.

The challenges before us are enormous, and we have seen recently that the strains and conflicts related to energy affordability, energy security and the need to reduce emissions require a delicate balancing act, comprehensive and sustainable solutions, and with all voices heard, and listened to.

Focusing on only one of these issues, while ignoring the others, can lead to unintended consequences, such as market distortions, heightened price volatility and energy shortfalls.

As President Sall in his remarks to the 76th Regular Session of the United Nations General Assembly said,

“Our countries cannot achieve an energy transition and abandon the polluting patterns of the industrialised countries without a viable, fair and equitable alternative….. Our countries, which are already shouldering the crushing weight of unequal trade, cannot bear the burden of an unfair energy transition.”

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy, is a right for all, not a privilege of the few, and is enshrined by the UN in Sustainable Development Goal 7.

The unfortunate reality for developing countries is that a staggering 759 million people worldwide did not have access to electricity in 2019, with around 79% of them located in Africa. Moreover, there were roughly 2.6 billion people or 34% of the global population who did not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies -- and this includes a massive 70% of Africans who have no access, exposing them to high levels of household air pollution.

The energy poverty numbers for Africa are stark. And to add in one further number, Africa accounts for only around 3% of global emissions.

OPEC believes that there is no “one size fits all” solution to addressing climate change. Different countries around the world have varying capabilities and diverse needs. Thus, reducing emissions should have multiple paths, as set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and all of them should be regarded as potential options.

As an industry, we must approach these critical issues together through dialogue and cooperation, ensuring that all voices are heard and all viewpoints are considered.

The oil industry can play a role in working towards our common goals. It possesses resources and expertise that should be utilized in developing more efficient technologies, particularly within the sphere of Carbon Capture and Sequestration technologies (CCUS).

Ladies and gentlemen,

As I alluded to earlier, in his remarks to the UN General Assembly, President Sall, made an eloquent address that resonated with OPEC, particularly when he said,

“The promise of a better world for all can bloom in the soil of dialogue and mutual respect…..To this end, we cannot be satisfied with a future of promises. We must work for a future of fulfilled promise.

This future requires us to lay down our arms, to stand in stronger solidarity, to protect our environment, to cultivate our shared values, to accept and respect our differences…. In this way, we will bring forth the world of our dreams, a world of peaceful coexistence, a better world for all.”

Well said, Mr President. OPEC shares and supports this vision for a better world.

Our Organization wants to work and strengthen our relations with energy stakeholders in West Africa and across the MSGBC Basin. We are delighted to participate in this event and look forward to seeing you all in person when it is safe to do so.

I wish everyone a successful MSGBC Oil, Gas and Power Conference and Exhibition.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/10-16-december-2021.html"
"2021-12-08","My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,

It was with great sadness that we had to postpone our in-person participation at the 23rd World Petroleum Congress (WPC). This was due to the ongoing challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic with a recently reintroduced lockdown in the OPEC Secretariat’s home country of Austria, as well as the emergence of the Omicron variant that has further complicated conditions.

The WPC is an extremely important global petroleum event, one I have attended on many previous occasions, and this year’s host Houston, the energy capital of the world, gives it even more pre-eminence.

When I am in Houston I always feel at home, with many oil industry executives, innovators and friends having their offices and homes there. I look forward to returning to Houston in the not too distant future.

It is also a great pleasure to share a platform again with my good friend, Joe McMonigle, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum. Joe has years of rich experience working on energy-related issues, both in the public and private sectors, and his views and thoughts are always welcome in any debate.

The topic of this session is – ‘Energy Transition: Scenarios for the Future’. It is very apt following on from the recent COP26 meeting in Glasgow, Scotland.

The COP26 negotiations were tense at times, but in the end, all Parties reiterated their commitment to the implementation and full operationalization of the Paris Agreement.

This was a positive step, giving the pressing need to reduce global emissions, alleviate energy poverty, counter the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and find a sustainable way forward that leaves no one behind.

However, as we all know the public discourse around energy, climate and sustainable development continues to be extremely emotive. This was evident in Glasgow, with some voices all but excluded, including many from our own petroleum industry.

At times, the narrative around the energy transition has been overtaken by emotional outbursts, with rational discussions based on facts, hard data and science, taking a back seat.

The parameters of the public discourse seem reduced to the question: are you for, or against fossil fuels? It is perhaps the ultimate false dichotomy.

It erroneously constrains what options are available. It should not be a question about ‘one or the other’. The complexity of the challenge calls for an inclusive approach; not the pursuit of a single ‘one size fits all’ panacea.

The challenges before us are enormous, and we have seen recently that the strains and conflicts related to energy affordability, energy security and the need to reduce emissions require a delicate balancing act, comprehensive and sustainable solutions, and with all voices heard, and listened to.

Focusing on only one of these issues, while ignoring the others, can lead to unintended consequences, such as market distortions, heightened price volatility and energy shortfalls.

Climate change and energy poverty are two sides of the same coin. We need to ensure energy is affordable for all; we need to transition to a more inclusive, fair and equitable world in which every person has access to energy as referenced in UN Sustainable Development Goal 7; and we need to reduce emissions.

It is an energy sustainability trilemma, with each piece having to move in unison.

What is clear is that the world will need more energy in the future. OPEC’s recently released World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2021 sees global energy demand expanding by 28% by 2045. It underlines the need to have a holistic view of the energy sector, and appreciate what each energy source can offer.

For oil and gas, there are some who believe that these industries should not be part of the energy future, that they should be consigned to the ‘dustbin of history’, and that the future is one that can be dominated by renewables and electric vehicles.

It is important to state clearly that the science does not tell us this, and the statistics related to the blight of energy poverty do not tell us this either.

Renewables are coming of age, with wind and solar expanding quickly, but – even by 2045 – in our WOO they are only estimated to make up around 24% of the global energy mix. Oil and gas combined are forecast to still supply over 50% of the world’s energy needs by 2045, with oil at around 28% and gas at just over 24%.

It is important to stress that many OPEC Member Countries have great solar and wind resources, and huge investments are being made in this field. OPEC welcomes the development of renewables, which will be vital to help quench the world’s growing thirst for energy.

In terms of electric vehicles, there is no doubt that they will continue to see expansion in the transportation sector. In our WOO, the share of electric vehicles in the total road transportation fleet is projected to expand to close to 20% in 2045. We support their development in a sustainable manner.

However, for many of the world’s population, electric vehicles do not offer a viable alternative to the internal combustion engine, primarily due to cost. There is also debate about how environmentally friendly they are considering their build process, especially the required batteries, mining for minerals and metals, and the sourcing of the vehicles’ electricity.

The key point to make is that the challenge of tackling emissions has many paths. It is not just one path for all, whether that be a country or an industry.

We fully believe that the oil and gas industries can be part of the solution to tackling climate change, and evolving the energy transition.

The history of Houston and the oil and gas industry is one of innovation. Of providing solutions to the most intractable of challenges.

I have no doubt the resources and expertise of our industry can be harnessed again to help develop cleaner and more efficient technological solutions, contributing to a reduction of emissions as part of unlocking a low-emissions future.

For example, carbon capture utilization and storage, blue hydrogen and others, can be utilized, as well as the promotion of the Circular Carbon Economy, to improve overall environmental performance.

We are ready, willing and able to play a key role. As we have seen through the prism of recent events, any talk of the oil and gas industries being consigned to the past and halting new investments in oil and gas is misguided.

On the investment issue, let me stress that this year’s WOO shows that investments of $11.8 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream oil sectors.

To place this in some further context, upstream capital expenditure fell by around 30% in 2020 as a result of the impact of the pandemic, and this follows drops of 27% in both 2015 and 2016. Investments have not recovered since a global level of $700 billion was witnessed in 2014, and they were at only half this level last year.

Let me stress that the return of investments is a core objective of the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, which has done so much to return balance and stability to the market since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020.

If the necessary investments are not made it could have knock-on implications, and leave long-term scars, particularly for security of supply, affecting not only producers, but consumers too.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me also stress how important the US will be to our energy future.

The US is a vital cog in the global oil and energy markets, as both a major producer and consumer.

We welcomed the decision of the Biden administration to return to the Paris Agreement, and take the lead at COP26. The energy transition and the global conversation around it would be incomplete without the US at the head of the multilateral table.

We also welcome the role of US oil and gas producers. They are a key part of addressing the energy transition, as are all oil and gas producers around the world.

It is OPEC’s deeply held conviction that dialogue and action on the energy transition should be inclusive and broad to try and evolve it in the least disruptive manner.

We need to think and act carefully about what an energy transition actually means; and we all need to follow the right paths.

The current energy market turmoil seen across the world in recent months is perhaps an early insight into some of the issues we are dealing with, and what can occur if we do not see the bigger picture and the interwoven complexities.

We need to connect all aspects of the energy sustainability trilemma.

Our energy future is not about ‘Them’ or ‘Us’. It has to be about ‘We’.

Working together we can build an energy future worthy of future generations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/11-8-december-2021.html"
"2021-11-10","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

This is no ordinary time. It is a landmark COP, where the future of humanity is at stake.

With negotiations of such magnitude and consequence, we must remember the often ignored scientific fact: climate change and energy poverty are two sides of the same coin.

The delicate balance between reducing emissions, energy affordability and security requires comprehensive and sustainable policies, with all voices being heard, and listened to. Focusing on only one of these over the others can lead to unintended consequences; market distortions, heightened volatility and energy shortfalls.

We need to ensure energy is available and affordable for all; we need to move towards a more inclusive, fair and equitable world in which every person has access to energy, aligned with SDG 7; and we need to reduce emissions.

It is an energy sustainability trilemma, with each piece having to move in unison.

The science tells us that tackling emissions has many paths. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, for countries or industries. The narrative that the energy transition is from oil and other fossil fuels to renewables is misleading and potentially dangerous to a world that will continue to be thirsty for all energy sources.

The capacities, national circumstances, and development priorities of developing countries must be taken into account.

The adverse socio-economic impacts on developing countries due to mitigation activities should be considered, to identify remediation measures and share best practices.

Financing is critical to reach climate targets set in developing countries’ NDCs. Developing countries have underscored the need for enhanced support, including financial resources, technological development and transfer, and capacity building, as well as a new collective goal for climate finance, to aid adaptation and back increased ambitions for climate mitigation action.

OPEC advocates putting multilateralism at the centre of energy, climate and sustainable development. We remain committed to the UNFCCC process, particularly the core elements of equity, common-but-differentiated responsibilities and national circumstances.

The oil and gas industry can foster its resources and expertise to help unlock a low-emissions future, through its role as a powerful innovator in developing more efficient technological solutions.

OPEC subscribes to a sustainable path forward; one that works for us all.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/12-10-november-2021.html"
"2021-11-09","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a distinct honour to address African Energy Week. I would like to congratulate and thank the African Energy Chamber for organizing this event and bringing together stakeholders in the energy industry from across our great continent to discuss the pressing issues of our day.

I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the Hon. Gwede Mantashe, South Africa’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy; HE Dr. Diamantino Pedro Azevedo, Angola’s Minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum and President of the OPEC Conference 2021; HE Bruno Jean-Richard Itoua, Minister of Hydrocarbons of Congo; HE Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Minister of Industry, Mines and Energy of Equatorial Guinea; HE Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources of Nigeria; all of whom worked to ensure that African Energy Week takes place in Africa, in the great city of Cape Town. Africa must be the destination of Africa related events.

I would also like to sincerely thank NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of the African Energy Chamber, for his tireless work in making this event possible.

African countries have historically assumed strong, proactive leadership roles in OPEC. Angola currently holds the Presidency of the OPEC Conference and will be succeeded by Congo next year. In September of this year, we celebrated a monumental milestone, the golden anniversary of Nigeria joining OPEC in 1971.

Recent years have seen an expansion of the African presence in our Organization. Congo became a Member Country in 2018, Equatorial Guinea joined in 2017 and Gabon rejoined in 2016.

This consolidates the incredibly positive, constructive and fruitful roles played by Libya since it joined our Organization in 1962, Algeria since 1969, Nigeria since 1971 and Angola since 2006.

Last year, to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of its founding, OPEC prepared a book chronicling the Organization’s history. What is remarkable are the number of key events that took place in African cities. From the 9th Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Tripoli in 1965, critical meetings and conferences have been held in Algiers (including our first ever Summit), Oran, Lagos, Abuja, Luanda, and Libreville. We hope this expands in the future.

Indeed, the idea for our Organization was conceived in Africa, specifically Egypt. It was at the Cairo Yacht Club in 1959, that the Gentleman’s Agreement was forged which paved the way for the establishment of OPEC in Baghdad in September 1960.

Aside from the African countries who are OPEC members, two African countries have joined the historic “Declaration of Cooperation,” between OPEC and 10 non-OPEC producing countries, namely Sudan and South Sudan. This enterprise, which began in 2016, involves OPEC working in concerted action with 10 non-OPEC Countries towards sustainable stability in the oil market.

The strong bonds between OPEC and Africa reflect the critical role that our continent will play in the future of the energy industry. This is one of the most prominent themes of OPEC’s recently launched World Oil Outlook 2045. Our flagship publication presents OPEC’s medium to long-term projections for the global economy, oil and energy demand and other factors pertaining to the industry.

The first thing to emphasize is that Africa has a young and vibrant population. The Middle East and Africa region is currently experiencing a swift rate of population growth. By 2045, it is forecast to be the leading region by overall population, adding 762 million people in the period 2020-2045.

We foresee a bright future for Africa's oil industry with significant opportunities for growth. The continent is home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world and several top gas-producing nations. The world will continue to rely on Africa’s precious resources in the long term in order to meet the rapidly rising global demand for oil and gas.

In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, Africa produced approximately 8.5 mb/d of oil, which is around 9% of world output. The continent’s proven oil reserves amounted to around 126 billion barrels at the end of 2019. Of this, Nigeria held the majority with an estimated 36.9 billion barrels, or 29%, of the continent’s total reserves.

In terms of the downstream sector, last year’s oil demand shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous refinery closures worldwide, and we will see additional closures in the coming years.

Looking ahead, from 2021 to 2026, we expect to see around 6.9 mb/d of new refining capacity come online, mostly in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Africa. Africa’s potential refining capacity is expected to start increasing in 2022 at just below 0.4 mb/d, before reaching just above 1 mb/d in 2026. Many of these projects will involve petrochemical integration.

Looking longer term to 2045, OPEC forecasts 14 mb/d of capacity additions, mostly in developing countries. In Africa, long-term demand growth will lead to an increase in refinery throughputs of almost 5 mb/d in 2045, up from 2.4 mb/d in 2019.

Another important downstream factor has to do with global refinery utilization rates, which are forecast at a rate of 81% in 2024 and slightly lower by 2026, yet still higher when compared to 2019 levels. These rates are forecast in consideration of recovering demand, in addition to the realization of numerous closures triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the longer term, utilization rates are expected to drop to approximately 76% in 2045 as more capacity comes online and demand declines in developed regions. This, of course, will result in additional closures in order to maintain rates at sustainable levels.

These overall positive developments in the African downstream will help increase local refined product output while reducing product imports from other regions.

In terms of downstream investment, we estimate a total of roughly $1.5 trillion will be spent during the period 2021-2045. $450 billion of this will be invested in new refinery projects and expansions of existing units. Most of these projects will be located in developing countries, including Africa.

Indeed, the importance of creating an investment-enabling environment is a further key conclusion from the WOO. Cumulative oil-related investment requirements amount to $11.8 trillion in the 2021-2045 period. Of this, 80%, or $9.2 trillion is in the upstream, with another $1.5 and $1.1 trillion needed in the downstream and midstream, respectively.

Creating the stability in the oil market necessary to attract the required levels of investment has been one of the primary motivations behind OPEC’s collaborative efforts with 10 non-OPEC countries under the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ umbrella. This pioneering framework for multilateral energy cooperation continues to contribute greatly to the post-pandemic economic recovery as a vital stabilizing force in the global oil industry.

Indeed, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has enabled the oil industry to withstand and recover from both the severe oil market downturn of 2014-2016 and the unprecedented oil market contraction following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We cannot talk about Africa’s energy future without discussing the twin challenges of sustainable development and climate change, two sides of the same coin.

This event promotes the vision of ‘Making Energy Poverty History by 2030.’ OPEC wholeheartedly subscribes to this noble vision. As this event takes place in the homeland of the late, great Nelson Mandela, Madiba, I cannot help but recall his words, when he said,

“Overcoming poverty is not a task of chaZrity, it is an act of justice. Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings.”

Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy, is a right for all, not a privilege of the few, as enshrined by the UN in Sustainable Goal 7.

The unfortunate reality for developing countries is that a staggering 759 million people worldwide did not have access to electricity in 2019, with around 79% of them located in Africa. Moreover, there were roughly 2.6 billion people or 34% of the global population who did not have access to clean cooking fuels and technologies -- and this includes a massive 70% of Africans who have no access, exposing them to high levels of household air pollution.

The energy poverty numbers for Africa are stark. And to add in one further number, Africa accounts for only around 3% of global emissions.

These factors need to be carefully considered at the ongoing 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26), currently taking place in Glasgow.

One of the most eloquent articulations of the need for a just energy transition, was penned by HE Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa, in advance of the COP. It was heartening to read how aligned the views of South Africa and OPEC are, in this regard.

As President Ramaphosa wrote,

“We must contend not only with these primary dangers [of climate change], but also with potential economic and social damage should the global community fail to deal with the crisis in a way that works for developing as well as developed markets.”

The President also noted,

“The only way for a transition to be successful is if there is broad commitment to a transition that is just – a journey to net zero that leaves no one behind.”

Similarly, OPEC has argued for a transition that is broad and inclusive, equitable and fair, and reflects common but differentiated responsibility.

President Ramaphosa also highlighted the need to capitalize on the advantages that many African countries have in the energy transition.

“South Africa is endowed with abundant natural and mineral resources. These can be harnessed to build a new economy in such areas as renewable energy and green hydrogen.”

The President also spoke sagaciously about the issue of climate finance.

“South Africa’s ambitions cannot be achieved without the more developed economies meeting promises they have made to provide financial assistance to developing economies in their energy transition….To be clear, this is not about charity. This is about fairness and mutual benefit.”

Well said, Mr President.

OPEC believes that there is no “one size fits all” solution to addressing climate change. Different countries around the world have varying capabilities and diverse needs. Thus, reducing emissions should have multiple paths, as set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and all of them should be regarded as potential options.

As an industry, we must approach these critical issues together through dialogue and cooperation, ensuring that all voices are heard and all viewpoints are considered.

The oil industry can play a role in working towards our common goals. It possesses resources and expertise that should be utilized in developing more efficient technologies, particularly within the sphere of Carbon Capture and Sequestration technologies (CCUS).

Ladies and gentlemen,

The challenges of our age can often appear overwhelming. We will continue to wrestle with the long-term scars of the COVID-19 pandemic for many years, if not decades. And yet, despite this context, this event, in this great country, inspires hope and courage.

In his autobiography, ‘Long Walk to Freedom,’ Nelson Mandela wrote,

“Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death.”

Let us seize the opportunities and confront the challenges of our age, inspired by the titans of African history and the spirit of the great people of this continent.

I wish everyone a successful African Energy Week.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/13-9-november-2021.html"
"2021-09-30","Distinguished delegates, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

I want to thank you all for attending this virtual launch of the 2021 Annual Statistical Bulletin. Allow me to thank our special guest and co-sponsor of this event Professor Thomas Lindner of the Vienna University of Economics and Business, for his participation in this launch here today. Your support of this flagship OPEC publication and our ongoing efforts to promote accurate, timely and transparent data in the global oil and gas industry are highly valued. Professor, we look forward to future collaboration with you on this and other projects of mutual interest.

I would also like thank the Head of the Data Services Department, Ms. Boshra AlSeiari and her team for the very rich presentations and engaging panel discussions on the ASB’s key highlights.

Again, I must also recognize the crucial contributions of our Member Countries to the production of this publication. This includes, of course, the OPEC Conference, the Board of Governors and the Economic Commission Board. Their contributions and leadership have been indispensable to our efforts.

Finally, allow me to express my appreciation to the staff here at the OPEC Secretariat who were involved in the production of this fine product, which will provide a wide array of stakeholders across this industry with reliable oil, gas and energy data made available at their fingertips through the ASB SmartApp. Although the Data Services Department led this project, valuable editorial, communications and public relations support was provided by the Department of Public Relations and Information.

Delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

Today’s launch of the 56th Edition of the Annual Statistic Bulletin helps to remind us what lies at the core of our work here at the OPEC Secretariat. And that is: numbers, figures, statistics and data. Every single decision taken is based on these, and that is why we spend so much time making sure they are accurate, up-to-date and transparent.

Year after year, for 56 years now, we have steadily enhanced the ASB and refined it to the point at which it has become a standard-bearer in this industry. Consequently, today, industry stakeholders rely on it as a trusted and valuable source.

Thus, it is with great pleasure that we once again release this flagship publication and provide it as a service to the global energy industry.

The ASB is just one of many initiatives OPEC continues to pursue in our overarching goal of promoting oil market stability, strengthening transparency while deepening the understanding of OPEC’s role within the global energy community.

OPEC and our non-OPEC partners of the Declaration of Cooperation are a leading example today of what can be achieved in our industry by working together and openly exchanging information and outlooks. This indeed goes to the core of OPEC’s vision and mission, and fully underpins our efforts to promote multilateral stakeholder engagement with our global partners.

We look forward to what we can achieve together in the coming years. My hope is that, going forward, the transparent data exchange and mutually beneficial dialogue at the global level will continue to flourish in the years ahead. This will underpin our ongoing efforts to promote a sustainable stability in the global oil market, in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/14-30-september-2021.html"
"2021-09-30","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome to this official launch of the 2021 Annual Statistical Bulletin.

Allow me to begin by welcoming our special guest and co-sponsor of this event Professor Thomas Lindner from the Vienna University of Economics and Business. This excellent institution of higher-education located right here in OPEC’s host city of Vienna is providing valuable training to the next generation of managers through its Masters programme in Energy Management.

Professor Lindner, the work you are doing through this programme is of high importance, particularly when you see the ongoing need for highly qualified professionals to lead our industry into the coming decades. We thank you for joining us today as a co-sponsor and hope we can continue to collaborate together in the coming years.

Ladies and gentlemen,

First published in 1965 and now in its 56th edition, the Annual Statistical Bulletin, the ASB, is one of OPEC’s flagship publications. Through the decades, it has become a highly valued resource for stakeholders across the industry.

A leading corporate executive once said, and I quote:

“The goal is to turn data into information and information into insight.”

These words encapsulate perfectly what we are trying to achieve with this publication.

Our readers, which include heads of industry, policymakers, energy analysts and academics, have increasingly turned to the ASB as a go-to reference tool for essential data on the global oil and gas industry. What they glean from the pages of the ASB will help them both form their insights and inform their decisions.

We at OPEC are dedicated to enhancing data transparency through broad dissemination of accurate and timely oil and gas data, not only for the ASB, but for all of our publications. Indeed, maintaining transparency in all that we do underpins our core goal of establishing sustainable oil market stability.

In terms of content, the ASB offers key statistical data for all of OPEC’s Member Countries, as well as valuable data related to non-OPEC oil producing countries. Readers will also benefit from valuable data on exports, imports, production, demand, refineries and shipping.

This year’s edition of the ASB reflects some of massive shifts in the industry that have resulted from the unprecedented effects of last year’s COVID-19 pandemic. This global health crisis has had massive implications for OPEC’s Member Countries and the entire industry value chain, which are still in various stages of recovery. These trends are captured in the ASB’s extensive time-series data, which will provide industry leaders and analysts alike with valuable input as to the future prospects for the industry.

In order to maximize access to this publication, we continue to leverage the latest emerging technologies. Now, in addition to the published print edition, there is a PDF version as well as an interactive online version that present historical data going back to 1960. Additionally, to further enhance access to the ASB’s content, we offer a SmartApp version for iOS and Android devices enabling access to valuable data at virtually any time and wherever you may be in the world.

Ladies and gentlemen,

This year’s Annual Statistical Bulletin is being launched amidst a special occasion as we celebrate the 61th Anniversary of OPEC’s founding on September 14th, 1960. This flagship publication has been produced for more than five-decades through a wide variety of industry environments and oil market cycles that experienced great successes but also very challenging down-swings.

Through it all, the ASB has, time and again, successfully fulfilled its mandate of providing a thorough, yearly statistical overview on OPEC’s Member Countries and the global industry.

Today, and moving forward, data will continue to stay at the core of OPEC’s ongoing activities in the global energy markets.

OPEC and its non-OPEC partners of the Declaration of Cooperation continue to make highly responsible and effective decisions based predominantly on accurate, timely and transparent data and statistics.

I would like to commend the OPEC Conference, the Board of Governors and the Economic Commission Board − OPEC’s economic think-tank − for their highly valuable contributions to our common efforts in optimizing our data flows in the interest of oil market stability. Without our Member Countries’ crucial input and contributions, we would not be able to produce this publication.

Additionally, OPEC continues to collaborate with the Joint Organizations Data Initiative (JODI), to ensure that accurate, timely and transparent data flows are constantly being optimized for the benefit of our joint efforts and for the wider oil industry.

These initiatives all point to OPEC’s ongoing commitment to 100% transparency in all that we do. The credibility of the Organization has indeed been further enhanced thanks to these endeavours.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to take a moment before closing to thank our colleagues at the OPEC Secretariat, particularly the Data Services Department, under the leadership of Ms. Boshra AlSeiari, for their formidable efforts in collaborating with our Member Countries to develop this excellent piece of work. I commend you all for producing a publication of high quality and timeliness that will be of great benefit to industry stakeholders.

We will now have the opportunity to screen a video highlighting the key findings of this year’s Annual Statistical Bulletin, after which we will hear remarks from our special guest and co-sponsor. This will be followed by a panel discussion on the key findings featuring analysts from the Data Services Department and finally a Q&A session with the international media.

I thank you all for attending and I wish us all a highly successful launch event today.

Thank you for your attention.

HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/15-30-september-2021.html"
"2021-07-07","Distinguished colleagues and guests,

It is my pleasure to welcome you to OPEC’s 4th Technical Workshop on Climate Change. It is good to see so many familiar faces joining us for this very timely discussion.

We are very pleased to see participants from some non-OPEC countries in the Charter of Cooperation, as well as China and India, along with many other valuable partners and our sister Organization, the OPEC Fund for International Development.

I would like to thank Khalid Abuleif for moderating today’s event. Besides being the senior advisor on Sustainability and Climate Policy for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, he is a highly respected veteran negotiator on international climate change agreements. We are most fortunate to have a line-up of distinguished panellists representing diverse perspectives, and I look forward to a robust exchange of ideas.

Distinguished colleagues and guests,

In less than four months, the 26th meeting of the Conference of Parties will begin in the UK. This year’s hosts see COP26 as an opportunity to accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

These global climate discussions come at a defining moment in our history. The COVID-19 pandemic and its terrible health and socio-economic impacts have laid bare the vital importance of global cooperation – including in the energy sector.

I shudder to think what would have happened last year had it not been for the unprecedented efforts undertaken by OPEC and our non-OPEC partners in the Declaration of Cooperation to restore oil market stability and support the global recovery. Significantly, the need for concerted action was recognized at the highest policy levels and by key global energy stakeholders, a reflection of the central importance of oil to the worldwide economy and our way of life.

However, today we are seeing increasing pressure coming from decision-makers, investors and even the boardrooms of oil majors to pursue policies and initiatives that could fundamentally alter the current energy mix – and create energy favourites. The publication of the International Energy Agency’s ‘Net Zero by 2050’ Report in May – six months before COP26 – exemplifies the shifting narrative, with pronounced implications across the board, including on the oil industry’s ability to invest across the value chain.

Also in May, a court in the Netherlands ordered Royal Dutch Shell to cut its global carbon emissions 45% by the end of 2030 compared to 2019 levels. This dramatic, far-reaching decision sets a precedent which could further shape energy policy directions and investment trends that are exclusionary in nature.

As the energy system transitions to a lower-carbon future, the oil industry needs capital to remain part of the solution – and, of equal importance, to continue to address the world’s growing thirst for energy. Looking ahead 25 years, OPEC’s respected World Oil Outlook sees the global economy doubling in size, the world’s population growing by more than 20%, and energy demand rising by around 25%. Energy stability is and will remain vital to our way of life.

The consensus among all leading forecasters is that oil, together with natural gas, will continue to provide at least half of the world’s energy needs for the foreseeable future. As a result, it is crucial that we continue to have access to capital to innovate, attract highly skilled workers, and to support sustainable stability.

At a time when the oil sector is coming under increasing pressure, it is only fair to keep an open mind about the full environmental impact and social footprint of other fuel sources, including the raw materials used in components for renewable energy. These impacts should be weighed against the ongoing advances in productivity across the petroleum value chain, as well as the oil industry’s many decades of experience in driving innovation and efficiency.

Another point I would like to make about the ongoing climate talks relates to something that is very dear to my heart – energy poverty. In my home continent of Africa alone, more than 600 million people have little or no access to electricity and around 900 million lack safe and clean cooking fuels. The scale of this challenge requires a portfolio of energy options, including abundant and economic resources like oil and gas. The post-COVID-19 recovery will not be complete so long as hundreds of millions of people live in energy poverty.

To support the consultative process on the issues I just mentioned, the OPEC Secretariat is hosting the First Ministerial Roundtable on Energy, Climate and Sustainable Development for oil-producing countries, to take place on September 6th under the umbrella of the OPEC and non-OPEC Charter of Cooperation.

The Roundtable is the first event of its kind held under the two-year-old Charter of Cooperation. It will bring together Ministers and a broad coalition of global energy stakeholders who will play a crucial role in the energy transition.

We aim to establish a regular forum that can develop common positions for oil-producing countries as they pursue the implementation of global environmental goals, and to ensure that the perspectives of our countries are included in the global climate discussions.

Distinguished colleagues and guests,

Today’s technical workshop provides an exciting opportunity to discuss in greater detail the climate initiatives of one of our Member Countries, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Last year, as you may recall, Saudi Arabia held the rotating presidency of the G20. The Kingdom used this influential platform to put the circular carbon economy (CCE) and its ‘4Rs’ – reduce, reuse, recycle and remove – on the global energy agenda. Leaders of the world’s top economies threw their support behind this holistic, integrated and inclusive approach to managing emissions and expanding energy access. Then in March of this year, Saudi Arabia launched the ‘Saudi Green Initiative’ and the ‘Middle East Green Initiative’ as a further contribution to the global climate efforts.

This trio of pragmatic initiatives form an integral part of the Kingdom’s efforts to enhance global engagement on energy and environmental policies through the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’. Moreover, Saudi Arabia wants to work with regional partners, many of them OPEC Member Countries, to transfer knowledge and share experiences.

In mid-June, John Kerry, the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, visited both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for consultations related to COP26. We understand that hydrogen and other promising technologies were among the topics of discussion. With regard to hydrogen, it is our view that this energy source has enormous potential to provide a multisector solution to the trilemma of secure, affordable and sustainable energy.

To help set the stage for today’s discussions, we have prepared several questions as a guide for our panel of respected experts. The floor is also open to other issues relevant to today’s workshop.

Before we begin the discussions, I would like to draw your attention to the words of HRH Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman when he announced the Kingdom’s key initiatives in March:

“Climate action will enhance competitiveness, spark innovation, and create millions of high-quality jobs. Young people, both in the Kingdom and the world, are demanding a cleaner, greener and more inclusive future, and we owe it to them to deliver on this. The Kingdom will work with all international partners to further develop these two initiatives and the various programmes and timelines entailed in them.”

I would now like to turn the microphone over to Khalid Abuleif, our moderator. I very much look forward to a robust exchange of ideas.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/16-7-july-2021.html"
"2021-07-06","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is both an honour and a privilege for me to address this 20th edition of the Nigeria Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition. Although it would have given me the utmost pleasure to return home and be with you in person, unfortunately the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions have prevented me from doing so. This being the case, we nevertheless join you there in Abuja in heart and soul!

Allow me to first recognize His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari and express my deep appreciation for his avid, undying support of Nigeria’s energy industry, which is so well represented at the proceedings of this Conference and Exhibition.

Mr. President, allow me, on behalf of OPEC, to congratulate you on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which was just passed by both chambers of 9th National Assembly of our great country. This long-awaited legislation for the oil and gas sector will help guide the necessary reforms designed to strengthen institutions, solidify regulatory and fiscal frameworks and attract much-need investment in a sustainable manner. The 9th National Assembly has engraved itself in gold in passing the Petroleum Industry Bill.

Additionally, OPEC is deeply indebted to President Buhari for the leading role he has played and continues to play in support of the OPEC-non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation process. This historic achievement has ushered in a new era in global energy cooperation as OPEC and its non-OPEC partners continue to provide crucial support to the oil market, in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy.

I would like to also recognize my brother, His Excellency, Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and Head of Delegation for OPEC. Excellency, your leadership and active participation continue to enrich our ongoing pursuits to forge a lasting stability in the oil market. On the domestic front, your ongoing contributions and leadership in guiding Nigeria’s energy industry into the future are both impressive and commendable.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

In its 20 years, the Nigeria Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition has risen to become one of Nigeria’s and indeed Africa’s largest and most prominent industry events.

Its creation was the brainchild of two icons of our industry. I am referring, of course, to the late Dr. Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria and the late Dr. Alirio Parra of Venezuela.

Their close working relationship, visionary leadership and even more importantly their strong personal friendship were the key ingredients behind the creation of this important forum we are having today.

We will miss these two industry icons more than ever this year as OPEC returns to its birthplace in Baghdad, Iraq this September to commemorate the 60th anniversary of its founding. I assure you, however, that their names will figure prominently in the many heartfelt tributes that will be made on this very special occasion.

Indeed, we will have a full programme of festivities planned to mark this momentous occasion, including the launch of the 60th Anniversary commemorative book, entitled OPEC at 60 and Beyond, which offers an in-depth chronology of the life and times of OPEC from 1960 to date.

Speaking of commemorations, we have another major milestone to celebrate this July, and that is the 50th Anniversary of Nigeria’s Membership in OPEC. We commemorate this golden anniversary with a very special edition of the OPEC Bulletin, which provides us with a splendid walk down memory lane from July of 1971 when Nigeria joined OPEC to the present day. This collector’s edition will be a fitting tribute for a nation that has been so instrumental in OPEC’s rich history.

Over the last five decades, OPEC and Nigeria have sown the seeds of friendship to build a highly fruitful and mutually beneficial relationship, forging strong ties that will last forever. Both the Nigeria at 50 special edition of the OPEC Bulletin and the 60th Anniversary Book chronicle and pay due tribute to this enduring partnership.

Many leading figures in the Nigerian energy establishment have contributed greatly to its successful membership in OPEC.

Over the past 50 years, Nigeria has had 23 Petroleum Ministers, 6 of whom have served as OPEC Conference Presidents and 4 of whom served as Secretary General.

The Conference Presidents were: Shettima Ali Monguno, Mallam Yahaya Dikko, Dr. Rilwanu Lukman, Prof. Jibril Aminu, His Royal Highness, Dr. Edmund Daukoru and Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu. Of these, Dr. Lukman takes the record, having presided over 14 Ministerial Conferences! These Presidents chaired 26 OPEC Ministerial Conferences around the world, including in Lagos, Abuja, Vienna, Geneva, Brioni, London, Osaka and Caracas.

The 4 Nigerian Secretaries General, including myself, were: Chief M.O. Feyide, Dr. Lukman, who held the post twice, and His Royal Highness, Dr. Edmund Daukoru. They served a combined total of 15 years, which is 30% of the time we have been a Member of OPEC! This is testament to Nigeria’s role as a diplomatic force and consensus builder within the Organization.

It is also important to mention here that our current esteemed President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, also served as Minister of Petroleum Resources from May 1976 until September of 1978, during which time he led Nigeria’s delegation to OPEC. He is currently the only President who has also served as an OPEC Minister.

I invite you all to join us as we celebrate the countless contributions Nigeria has made to OPEC’s rich history over the last half-century.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

In OPEC’s eventful 60-year history, one thing that we have learned is that, in this industry, you must learn to “expect the unexpected”.

And sure enough, last year, we were reminded of just this when the World Health Organization announced on March 11th 2020 that the rapidly spreading COVID-19 virus was now a global pandemic.

This health crisis was and continues to be, first and foremost, a human tragedy with countless innocent lives being lost. But, it has also exacted major damage on the global economy and on oil demand, which dropped by a stunning 22 mb/d in April of 2020 at the height of the pandemic. The world economy contracted by 3.4% year-over-year in 2020.

Nigeria and its fellow OPEC Member Countries suffered massive economic losses, and its oil and gas industries were in dire straits. However, the rapid and decisive response of the DoC producers once again came to the rescue and delivered CPR to an industry on the verge of collapse.

In the past weeks and months, we have seen a welcome shift in momentum as significant progress continues to be made on the rollout of global vaccination campaigns.

More than 3.2 billion doses have now been administered globally, and millions more are being provided each day. Additionally, there are signs that the international community is ramping up its support to developing countries to help bolster their acquisition of life-saving vaccines. In this regard, the G7 recently announced combined pledges of 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to be distributed around the world, of which at least half are expected to be delivered by the end of 2021.

Our hope is that this support will continue to grow in the weeks and months to come. The world will only truly defeat this pandemic when both developing and developed countries have the ability to vaccinate their populations to reach herd immunity. This, in turn, will enable all countries to re-open their economies and bring their energy industries back up to full-speed.

The global economy has, for the most, part recovered and is expected to see growth of 5.5% this year, and we forecast world oil demand to rise by 6.0 mb/d. Both the economy and oil demand are expected to see accelerated growth in the second half of this year.

There is, however, a range of uncertainties that we are monitoring closely. These include an elevated risk of inflation due to massive financial stimulus programmes, uneven vaccine rollouts across the world and the spreading COVID-19 Delta Variant, which is now even impacting countries with high vaccination rates.

This challenging backdrop will require the Declaration of Cooperation producers to remain proactive, flexible and vigilant. This prudent approach moving forward will enable the DoC to remain agile and responsive while avoiding unwanted market imbalance after April 2022. In this regard, following the most recent Ministerial Meetings held at the beginning of July 2021, the DoC producers will continue to convene on a monthly basis within the context of the Declaration of Cooperation.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

I would like to now switch gears and move to the theme of this keynote address, which is: Global Oil Market Dynamics in a Decarbonizing World.

As you have surely read in the headlines over the past year, the unpredictability and volatility brought on by the pandemic has intensified discussions related to climate change and the energy transition.

Countries around the world are feverishly attempting to adapt to the rapidly changing dynamics in the energy industry in an effort to adapt and mitigate the impacts of climate change.

Investors, environmental lobbyists and even some corporate boards are pressuring oil companies and governments to pursue radical policies and initiatives that could, in the end, be more disruptive than productive for the global energy industry.

There have recently even been calls for investments in oil and gas to be discontinued, which is a dangerous and unrealistic scenario. These voices have emerged particularly in the context of the net-zero 2050 emissions discussions.

The fact is, however, that oil and gas have an important role to play in the energy transition. Let me be clear, OPEC supports the need to reduce emissions, bolster efficiency and embrace innovation, but we must be aware of the risk we run of not adequately investing in the future of this industry. We are already dealing with the harsh impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had on investment, which declined by 30% in 2020.

If this were to continue, we could see demand exceed supply, posing a significant energy security risk to both producers and consumers. And this, of course, could result in knock-on effects for both the global economy and geopolitics.

One must also consider that, although many of OPEC’s Member Countries have made good progress in diversifying their economies, many of them rely primarily on revenue from their oil and gas assets to support their economic and social development.

Let’s face it, there is simply not a “one size fits all” solution to addressing climate change. Different countries around the world have varying capabilities and diverse needs. Thus, reducing emissions has many paths, as set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and we must consider all of them as viable options.

Additionally, when considering the scale of the energy transition, we must harness all available energies.

The oil and gas industries have much to offer in this regard, including some of the world’s most cutting-edge technologies and advanced innovations, which can all be leveraged to promote a lower carbon future.

From the perspective of science and innovation, we believe technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), hydrogen and other technologies are viable options for reducing the carbon footprint.

Energy efficiency programmes will also be key, and the Circular Carbon Economy, which was endorsed by the G20 under the Presidency of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a blueprint for how this industry can improve its efficiencies while reducing emissions. CCE with its four “Rs” - reduce, reuse, recycle and remove – provides a balanced and inclusive solution for dealing with greenhouse gas emissions.

OPEC also welcomes the development of renewables, and many of our Member Countries are leading the way with massive investments in solar and wind resources.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

Achieving net zero emissions by 2050 is already a great challenge for advanced economies, some of whom have expressed their doubts about the reality of achieving this ambitious goal. And thus, for developing nations, it is even that much more daunting, particularly as they are occupied with ensuring their basic needs are met day in and day out. Each day is a challenge to simply put food on the table and earn a decent living wage.

There are emerging doubts as to how realistic the net-zero approach is, particularly when considering the unique circumstances of developing countries, especially in combatting another scourge, namely energy poverty.

Allow me to point out three significant challenges to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, namely scale and timing, supply chains and the developing world.

In terms of scale and timing, the 28-year period from now until 2050 is not adequate to achieve net-zero emissions, considering the scale of investments required, the availability of land, the required massive expansion of the electricity grid and a host of nearly 400 milestones that would need to be reached to achieve the net-zero goal. The last transition took nearly 200 years to cycle through, and now we want to achieve an even more ambitious transition in less than 30 years! This is simply not realistic.

Additionally, a swift transition to clean energy sources would be highly reliant on the steady, robust supply of critical minerals such as copper, cobalt, lithium, nickel and aluminium, many of which are produced in a geographically centralized area. We must also consider that the amount of mineral material needed to produce energy is higher than with fossil fuels. For example, a typical electric car requires six times the mineral inputs than that required to power a conventional vehicle with fossil fuels, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more mineral resources than a gas-fired plant of the same capacity. Furthermore, lengthy lead times on mining projects, which can surpass 16 years, could inhibit the sector from responding to increases in demand.

Finally, the net-zero scenario assumes that both developed and developing countries will achieve the proposed targets by 2050, with developed countries reaching their targets earlier. However, let me remind you that a staggering 790 million people worldwide did not have access to electricity in 2020, most of them located in Sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia. Moreover, there were roughly 2.6 billion people who did not have access to clean cooking fuels, 35% of whom were in Sub-Saharan Africa, 25% in India and 15% in China. And, let us not forget that these are the very regions that are expected to see the most rapid population growth by 2050.

This brings me to the critical topic of energy transition financing, which will be a highly debated issue at the upcoming COP26 in November.

The achievement of the net-zero 2050 goals would assume that developing countries will receive the required financing and technological know-how they require to build and readjust their energy systems in line with the net-zero ambitions by 2050.

However, climate financing for adaptation and mitigation is an extremely complex process, and questions continue to be raised as to how the $100 billion per year committed in the Paris Agreement will be secured, much less the even more ambitious $5 trillion annual funding needed globally as set out by the net-zero 2050 plan.

Another issue of concern is that climate financing is increasingly being administered as loans, which means that developing countries are required to borrow at interest rates that can sometimes be prohibitively high, effectively leading them to defer or cancel their clean energy projects.

These important factors all point to the fact that an energy transition on such a massive scale and within such a short timeframe will take time and patience to achieve, especially if it is done responsibly, in an equitable and inclusive manner.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

Let us remind ourselves that Sustainable Development Goal number seven of the United Nations was established to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all people. OPEC firmly believes that nobody should be left behind in the energy transition.

History tells us, however, that in times of great challenge and crisis, developing countries are more prone to experience social unrest, rising inequality and increased poverty. Thus, it is of utmost importance that this energy transition be both equitable and inclusive. To achieve this, we must work through the multilateral system with the dedication and support of all energy stakeholders.

OPEC will continue to work closely with its Member Countries to advocate for real change on this topic in all relevant international fora, including the upcoming COP26 in Glasgow.

It is essential that we use as our energy and climate roadmap in accordance with the core principles of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, namely equity, historical responsibility and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

Excellencies, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

To meet the future challenges I have just outlined, we are convinced more than ever, that the world needs to see more dialogue and more cooperation in an inclusive fashion. OPEC is doing its part through the landmark OPEC and non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation, and we also continue to engage in high-level producer-consumer dialogues with the European Union, China, India and the United States, as well as with a host of international organizations.

In closing, allow me to inspire you with the sage words of 13th century philosopher and scholar Muḥammad Rūmī who said, and I quote:

“Don't be satisfied with stories, how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth.”

Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

When we think about our beloved continent of Africa, let us not be satisfied with stories of how it has gone with others, but, as Muhammad Rumi teaches us here, let us unfold our own myth, let us tell our own story and let us do all we can do to see Africa thrive and reach its full potential for this and future generations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/17-6-july-2021.html"
"2021-06-01","Excellencies,

Two months ago today, the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting took the forward-looking step of gradually increasing production, in line with the brightening outlook for both the economy and oil demand. Today marks the start of the second month of the stepped-up production increases, and our compass continues to point in the direction of a durable recovery.

Step-by-step progress is being made on providing life-saving vaccinations to the world. Around 1.9 billion doses have now been administered globally, and millions more are being given every day. We are encouraged by the international commitments to support developing countries so they can acquire sufficient vaccines, and thus improve the chances for a durable and inclusive recovery.

Turning first to the global economy, our latest projections show GDP growth of 5.5% in 2021, up from 5.4% at our last meeting and driven by expectations for a robust second half of the year.

China and the US continue to fuel the growth prospects for the year, with China’s economy on course to expand by 8.5% and the US by 6.2%. Despite the tragic second wave of COVID-19 in India, India’s economy is still expected to grow by 9.7%. The Euro-zone, where there has been a gradual easing of strict lockdowns, should benefit from pent-up consumer demand and the beginning of the summer holiday season. Growth in the Euro-zone this year is forecast at 4.2%.

The projections for oil are largely unchanged from our last meeting, with demand expected to grow by 6 mb/d to around 96.5 mb/d on average for the year, an increase of 6.6%. As with the economy, the market outlook for later this year looks especially promising. In fact, we anticipate that demand will surpass 99 mb/d in the fourth quarter, which would put us back in the range of pre-pandemic levels.

Overall, demand in countries outside the OECD should rise by nearly 6.8%, or 3.3 mb/d, this year, and by almost 6.4%, or 2.7 mb/d, in the OECD. This is a welcome turn of events from the sombre situation we experienced in 2020.

Here, I would caution that this is no time for complacency. As we know from experience over the past year, COVID-19 is a persistent and unpredictable foe, and vicious mutations remain a threat to both human health and the recovery. Furthermore, many leading economies are pumped up by record levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, debt levels have soared, and inflation is beginning to rear its ugly head in some countries.

We are also monitoring the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action talks that are taking place here in Vienna. IR Iran is a Founder and an extremely important and valued Member of OPEC. We anticipate that the expected return of Iranian production and exports will occur in an orderly and transparent fashion, thereby maintaining the relative stability that we have worked hard to achieve since April of last year.

Turning to the supply side, non-OPEC liquids production is now forecast to grow at a slightly slower pace than we expected last month, rising by around 700,000 b/d in 2021 to an average of 63.6 mb/d. In the US, liquids production is expected to dip slightly, to around 17.6 mb/d, despite the improving market conditions and demand prospects. Both conventional and tight crude production are forecast to decline in the US, while NGLs and biofuel output are expected to rise. In contrast to the US, liquids production is expected to grow in Canada, Brazil, China and Norway.

We continue to keep a close watch on OECD commercial oil inventories. April data showed a drop of 6.9 mb from the previous month, to 2.96 billion barrels. On the positive side, inventories have fallen by 250 mb from their peak of 3.2 billion barrels in the middle of 2020. OECD commercial stocks fell to 66 days in April 2021, 12.3 days lower than the April 2020 levels, but still 3.9 days above the 2015-2019 average.

In the US, total commercial stocks fell by more than 8% in April, to nearly 1.3 billion barrels, about 2% below the latest five-year average. Yesterday was the Memorial Day holiday in the US, the traditional start of the summer driving season, and we are hopeful this will accelerate the drawdown.

Our latest data also show that the backwardation structure of all three major benchmarks lessened slightly in April. Hedge funds and other money managers slightly raised their long positions in crude following the sell-off seen in March, with gains concentrated mainly in Brent.

Month-on-month, the actions of the Declaration of Cooperation continue to support the rebalancing process, and have helped reduce the global supply by more than 2.9 billion barrels since May 2020.

However, there continues to be significant overproduction by some of the participating countries. The overproduced volumes need to be accommodated to achieve the goals we have set for ourselves.

In this regard, the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting agreed to extend the very generous compensation period for overproduced volumes until the end of September 2021. Our continued contributions to sustainable oil market stability depend upon all participants achieving 100% conformity and, where necessary, working dutifully to compensate for overproduction.

The advice and guidance of this Committee, along with the support of the Joint Technical Committee, is vital to supporting the Declaration of Cooperation decision-making process.

As we prepare for the 17th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, allow me to draw inspiration from the renowned Russian writer Ivan Turgenev, who said - and I quote:

“If we wait for the moment when everything, absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin.”

From the very beginning of the Declaration of Cooperation, we have never stood back and waited to act. Rather, we have worked proactively and with determination, and our efforts to restore oil market balance and stability continue to bear fruit. I look forward to the work before us today, and to our continued and valued cooperation going forward.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/18-1-june-2021.html"
"2021-04-08","Dear distinguished Members and Observers of the IMFC,

The global economy and, consequently, the global oil market are slowly emerging from one of the most severe crises in recent history, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, countries around the world virtually shut down, imposed travel restrictions and mandated social-distancing measures. These measures are still necessary in some regions to combat new waves of infections and virus mutations, with a recovery to pre-pandemic levels not yet projected for 2021. Following an estimated decline of 3.5% in 2020, the OPEC Secretariat forecasts global economic growth of 5.4% in 2021.

The measures to stem the spread of COVID-19 not only severely affected global economic growth, they also caused a historic demand shock in the oil market, which led to extreme volatility in oil prices. The impact of the lockdown measures has disproportionally affected mobility and thereby fuel demand. World oil demand is therefore estimated by the Secretariat to have contracted by a very significant 9.5 mb/d in 2020 and is forecast to grow by around 6 mb/d in 2021. Similarly, non-OPEC supply suffered from the unprecedented events and is estimated to have declined by around 2.5 mb/d in 2020, while it is forecast to grow by around 1 mb/d in 2021.

In response to the global crisis and the massive oil demand contraction, OPEC and 10 non-OPEC participating countries under the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ (DoC) acted swiftly and decisively to contribute to more stability in the oil market, by voluntarily adjusting production. These are the largest and longest in duration in the history of the oil industry, lasting until well into 2022. A series of technical and ministerial Meetings of both the OPEC Conference and the countries participating in the DoC throughout 2020 and 2021 have successfully responded to market challenges and confirmed the commitment to sustainable oil market stability. These joint efforts succeeded in driving down the unprecedentedly high commercial oil inventories.

In closing, OPEC would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm its longstanding commitment to supporting oil market stability for the mutual benefit of consuming and producing nations, contributing significantly to addressing the common challenges to the global economy.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/19-8-april-2021.html"
"2021-04-01","Excellencies,

I would like to take this opportunity to offer a very warm welcome to HE Mohamed Ahmad Aoun, Libya’s new Minister of Oil. Excellency, on behalf of OPEC and the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), we wish you great success in your important role. We would also like to extend our sincerest thanks to HE Mustafa Sanalla, Chairman of the Libyan National Oil Corporation for the many contributions he has made to OPEC and the DoC throughout his tenure as Libya’s representative to OPEC.

Excellencies,

It is exactly one year ago that we were beginning the horrifying month of April 2020. None of us will forget the traumatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on people’s lives, and on the oil industry, with demand dropping by more than 20 mb/d, and WTI plunging to a negative $37/b!

It was a visceral time for us all, but it was also broken by the historic production adjustments from the group of producers I see before me on the screen today.

It has proven to be a prescient decision. The Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) and the steadfastness to conformity and compensation from participants has been central to the recovery of the industry that is such a vital cog in oiling the global economy.

We need to continue on this path, be guided by the data and analysis, review the outlook on a regular basis and take things one step at a time. The cautious and careful approach has proven effective thus far, as can be viewed in the decision taken at the 14th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

The decision to approve a continuation of the production adjustment levels of March 2020 into April was judicious, particularly given the market volatility we all witnessed in the last two weeks of March, with significant market sell offs and crude futures flipping into contango. This was driven by a combination of rising coronavirus cases and new variants, further lockdowns in Europe, concerns over softening oil demand and generally more fragility in the outlook.

Crude futures, however, did move back into backwardation following the longer than expected blockage of the Suez Canal, a vital artery for global trade.

On the topic of crude futures, let me say that the launch on March 29 of the world’s first Murban Futures contract, pricing the flagship Abu Dhabi grade, is an historic moment for the UAE, ADNOC, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Abu Dhabi. The exchange is also supported by nine of the world’s largest energy companies and traders, and has been realized with great vision, fortitude and years of hard work in the UAE.

This is also an opportunity to commend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and HRH Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on the launch earlier this week of the ‘Shareek’ programme that focuses on strengthening partnerships between the government, the private sector and local companies. There is no doubt that this will contribute towards the country’s economic growth and development, and be vital to prosperity in global markets.

Returning to the oil market, there are evidently many positives to focus on too, such as the rollout of vaccines, further fiscal stimulus, particularly the huge $1.9 trillion package in the US, and of course, the continued commitment of the DoC on sustained market stability and bringing down inventory levels.

Today, we need to decide on the next step as we chart a path for the rest of the second quarter of 2021 and beyond, so allow me to provide you with a few highlights and shifting trends to forecasts since we met last at the beginning of March.

Last month we saw global economic growth in 2021 at 4.8%, but expectations are now higher at 5.1%. The additional US stimulus measures are a major driver in this upward impetus, but our recent scenario analysis suggests that this slight uptick may need to be revised given the many uncertainties elsewhere.

Global oil demand in 2021 is slightly lower at 5.6 mb/d. We also need to remember that demand contracted by 9.6 mb/d in 2020, so a return to 2019 levels is not expected before 2022.

On the demand front, we continue to see a divergence between the first and second half of 2021. The first half has again been adjusted lower, primarily on the back of extended measures and new lockdowns in many key parts of Europe. Oil demand growth in the second half, however, remains intact. This reflects prospects for a stronger economic recovery with the positive impact of further vaccination rollouts.

What the economic and demand outlook are showing us is that we need to be watchful, and tread a prudent path. There remains many impediments and potential obstacles to the recovery, including further lockdowns; the uneven rollout of vaccines across the world; the prevalence of COVID-19 variants; sovereign debt levels in many regions; and inflationary pressures and central bank responses.

From the supply perspective, non-OPEC liquids is forecast to grow by almost 1 mb/d in 2021, compared to 0.7 mb/d expected at our last meeting. One important point of reference is that the US liquids supply forecast remains unchanged, with growth of 0.16 mb/d in 2021.

Looking at inventories, preliminary February 2021 data shows a further OECD commercials drawdown of around 45 mb. This follows a drop of around 14 mb in January. The February level is 95 mb higher that the same time one year ago, and 58 mb above the average for the period 2015-2019.

What is evident in the February stock draw is that it is mainly attributed to products, particularly in the US. Product inventories moved sharply lower on the back of very low refinery runs as a result of severe US winter weather.

The realignment of inventories is also been driven by the excellent conformity to the production adjustments from DoC participants. The large and generous additional commitment of 1 mb/d for February, March and April from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has also been instrumental in the rebalancing process, and in helping achieve a more stable market. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has shown exemplary leadership.

The forward-looking commitment is eloquently summarised by Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī:

""Patience is not sitting and waiting, it is foreseeing. It is looking at the thorn and seeing the rose, looking at the night and seeing the day. Know that the moon needs time to become full.”

The dedication, teamwork and flexibility we have shown over the past year has been a guiding light for the recovery we have all witnessed. In this regard, I would like to applaud the exemplary leadership of the co-Chairs, HRH Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman and Alexander Novak, who have led from the front during this most extraordinary year in the history of oil.

This focus and commitment needs to remain front and centre of everything we do, as we look to build on what we have achieved so far.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/20-1-april-2021.html"
"2021-04-01","Colleagues, distinguished delegates,

Welcome to the 15th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

Let me begin by expressing my appreciation to our Chairman and Co-Chairman for their skilled leadership, and I thank all the delegates for your dedication to our common cause.

I am aware that a new, strict lockdown began today for Vienna and parts of Austria. On behalf of all OPEC Member Countries, I thank His Excellency Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo and his capable staff at the OPEC Secretariat for the consistently excellent research, technical support and coordination you provide despite the challenging circumstances in our host city.

It has been nearly a year since the 9th and 10th Extraordinary Meetings of this group took place amidst a rapidly spreading pandemic, and rising uncertainty about the stability of the crude oil market.

All of us who were in attendance at those meetings will recall the urgency of the situation, and the urgent need for action.

Today, the outlook for the oil industry is much more positive, thanks largely to our resolute efforts to stabilize the global oil market, restore its potential, and provide a platform for recovery.

We continue to see progress on COVID-19 vaccinations, which are injecting hope for the future and energizing the global economy. Of course, the way forward needs to be inclusive: developing and emerging countries must not be left behind on the road to renewal and recovery.

I sincerely hope we never again experience the oil market turmoil we witnessed in the first months of the pandemic. Speaking from an African perspective, our oil-producing countries need sustained market stability to enable the industry to grow, and to support the resilience of African economies.

Globally, we have seen steady improvements in oil market fundamentals and the demand outlook. Producers, consumers and the global economy all share the benefits of our joint efforts to restore stability, optimism and opportunity.

I would like to recognize all participating countries for their individual and collective efforts on conformity, which stood at 113% in February. This is a noble accomplishment and attests to our unity and resolve. Each participating country must continue to do its part so that, together, we achieve our full potential.

I thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the additional voluntary adjustment of 1 million barrels per day for February, March and April. This generous contribution gives those who have not yet reached full conformity the opportunity to achieve their goal.

Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources of Nigeria, has also been instrumental in supporting improved conformity as Special Envoy to Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and South Sudan. I thank him and our colleagues from these countries for their hard work. Their participation in workshops on conformity further support our mutually beneficial efforts.

Colleagues, distinguished delegates,

Despite the light we can see on the horizon, we must be aware of the clouds that remain.

The pandemic continues to disrupt international travel and traditional ways of doing business, casting a lingering shadow over the prospects for oil demand growth. Our meetings are evidence of this. This is the seventh time in a year that our distinguished group has met on a virtual platform.

In a few months, athletes from around the world are due to compete in the ultimate symbol of friendship and cooperation – the Olympics. Already delayed by a year, the Tokyo Games will take place in mostly empty stadiums because of travel restrictions. Even the athletic competitions that test physical endurance cannot escape the strong grip of this pandemic.

The OPEC and non-OPEC partners in the Declaration of Cooperation have endured Olympic-sized tests and trials through the 2014-2016 market crisis and now COVID-19. When it comes time for the awards, I believe we are well positioned to win a Gold medal for our teamwork.

The observed volatility in the market during whole month of March, in particular last week, once again has proven the value of our prudent approach with cautious optimism.

Today, it is our task to again demonstrate the forward-looking leadership that has helped restore market confidence, support sustainable stability, and provide a platform for recovery.

Thank you, and I look forward to another successful meeting.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/21-1-april-2021.html"
"2021-04-01","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Excellency and Co-chair, Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federa-tion,

Excellency President of OPEC,

Welcome to the 15TH meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers.

Before we get to the scheduled business of to-day, I must thank OPEC for its recent state-ment in support of the Kingdom’s ‘Saudi Green Initiative’ and the ‘Middle East Green Initiative’.

These form an important part of the King-dom’s efforts to address climate change and reduce emissions and the region’s environmen-tal footprint.

OPEC and its Member Countries are natu-rally committed to sustainable oil market sta-bility.

But they are also committed to addressing is-sues of global concern, including sustainable development, environmental initiatives and cli-mate change, and the eradication of energy poverty.

The new initiatives would allow the Kingdom to work with regional and global partners, many of whom are Members of this Group, and to transfer knowledge and share experi-ences.

OPEC and the oil and gas industry must be part of the solution to climate change. They possess critical resources and expertise that can help meet the challenge of reducing global Green House Gas emissions.

G20 leaders have already endorsed the strat-egy advanced by Saudi Arabia to deal with cli-mate change - the Circular Carbon Economy and its 4Rs - reduce, reuse, recycle and remove - as an inclusive and balanced solution for dealing with greenhouse gas emissions.

It also embraced advanced technology as a crucial part of the global energy agenda.

On such a vital subject as climate change, which impacts the lives and livelihoods of eve-rybody on the planet and of generations to come, we must draw on this same spirit of unity that we have shown in dealing with the oil market over the past year.

We look forward to working with this Group in exploring possible work streams that would enhance our collaboration in this important area.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Last month, we called for a cautious and re-strained approach, and - unfortunately - we have been proved right by subsequent develop-ments.

Those who said we were behind the curve and not being responsive to the needs of the market have now recognized that OPEC+ cautious po-sition was the correct course of action.

We should all act in humility and recognize the limitations of our predictive powers in the face of unprecedented conditions.

In today’s uncertain environment, charting a rigid path to recovery is unwise.

The reality remains that the global picture is far from even, and the recovery is far from complete.

On the supply side, we have continued to play our part.

Compliance with the levels we agreed has - once again - been impressive, with new aggre-gate levels set at 113 per cent.

But we have to approach the coming weeks with the same admirable commitment.

And until the evidence of the recovery is unde-niable, we should maintain this cautious stance.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Few months back, we found ourselves in the eye of the storm. The sea conditions have im-proved and through our efforts we have stead-ied the ship.

For most part, the market is on stable footing and stocks continue to draw down.

In some parts of the world such as the US and the UK, the rollout of vaccines has been very effective.

Stimulus measures are providing much needed support to revive the global economy.

Even in those sectors that were badly hit such as airline travel, there are signs of meaningful improvement.

But the waves are still tall and the sea remains rough.

In the Eurozone, infection rates continue to rise and countries are reimposing full or par-tial lockdowns and extending restriction to combat a third wave.

Steering the ship in these current conditions where different scenarios are playing out in various regions of the world requires a steady hand on the tiller as I said back in February. It also requires flexibility and being responsive to market needs.

Our agreement back in December 2020 pro-vided us with a flexible mechanism to hold monthly meetings starting from January 2021 and to decide on whether to adjust output, be it increase, maintain, or decrease production depending on market conditions.

Continuing with this flexible approach will serve us best.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/22-1-april-2021.html"
"2021-03-31","Excellencies,

One year ago, we were on the precipice of heading into the dark month of April 2020. It would be a harrowing month for the oil industry, with economies in lockdown, oil demand dropping by more than 20 mb/d and WTI plummeting negative.

The month of April 2020, however, also saw the landmark production adjustments from the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC). The commitment that this group of producers has shown to this decision, with strong conformity to the adjustments, as well as support for the compensation mechanism, has been front and centre in the recovery.

In the first three months of 2021, we have witnessed further positives for the recovery in terms of vaccine rollouts, as well as from fiscal stimulus, most recently the huge $1.9 trillion package in the US.

The positives offer hope, but we need to remember that the environment remains challenging, complex and uncertain, with the market volatility we have witnessed in the last two weeks of March a reminder of the fragility facing economies and oil demand.

These monthly meetings are vital for the DoC, and with this in mind, allow me to give you a brief overview of developments in the key metrics since we last met.

Expectations for global economic growth in 2021 are now higher at 5.1%, compared to 4.8% at our last meeting. This positive impetus is driven by the additional US stimulus measures, as well as a continued acceleration in the recovery in Asian economies, although we have recently seen a temporary stalling of the rebound in India.

However, we should not be out smelling the flowers just yet, and this forecast may be revisited. It is surrounded by uncertainties, including the prevalence of COVID-19 variants; the uneven rollout of vaccines; further lockdowns and third waves in several countries; and inflationary pressures and central bank responses.

Moreover, we have also seen crude futures flip into a contango for the first time since mid-January, although they returned again to backwardation as markets digested the blockage of the Suez Canal.

Global oil demand in 2021 is revised slightly to stand at 5.6 mb/d, and we need to keep in mind that demand contracted by a huge 9.6 mb/d in 2020.

There is also a continuing divergence between the first and second half of 2021. The first half has again been adjusted lower, mainly due to extended measures and new lockdowns in many key parts of Europe. In contrast, oil demand prospects in the second half have remained relatively steady, reflecting expectations for a stronger economic recovery and positive impact of vaccination rollouts.

On the supply side, non-OPEC liquids for 2021 is forecast to grow by almost 1 mb/d, compared to expectations of 0.7 mb/d at our last meeting. It is also interesting to note that the US liquids supply forecast remains unchanged, with growth of 0.16 mb/d in 2021.

From the perspective of inventories, preliminary data for February 2021 shows a further drawdown of around 45 mb in OECD commercials, following a drop of around 14 mb in January. The February level is 95 mb higher that the same time one year ago, and 58 mb above the average for the period 2015-2019.

It is important to note that the February stock draw is attributed mainly to products, particularly in the US market, as product inventories moved sharply lower on the back of very low refinery runs as a result of severe winter weather.

The realignment of inventories is also been driven by the excellent conformity to the production adjustments from DoC participants, and here we should again acknowledge the large and generous additional commitment of 1 mb/d for February, March and April from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

This leadership, this goal-focused commitment is summed up wisely by Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī:

“If you want the moon, do not hide from the night; if you want a rose, do not run away from the thorns.”

The guidance and advice from this JMMC, ably supported by the JTC and the OPEC Secretariat, continues to be vital to the DoC decision making process. It is our task again today to review the current situation and provide feedback for tomorrow’s OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting as we navigate a course for the rest of the second quarter of 2021 and beyond.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/23-31-march-2021.html"
"2021-03-29","Mr President, Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.

I am deeply honoured to have been asked to deliver this goodwill message as my home country Nigeria opens its ‘Decade of Gas’ summit.

Under the visionary leadership of our esteemed President, HE Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, the ‘Decade of Gas’ from 2021-to-2030 looks to place Nigeria at the forefront of this vital global industry.

From OPEC, I would also like to express our deep gratitude to President Buhari, who has long been an advocate, including as Minister of Petroleum and Head of Nigeria’s Delegation to OPEC, in the Organization’s overarching commitment to sustainable market stability.

This was clearly on display during the unprecedented oil market slump in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the President playing a leadership role in unifying the commitment of participants in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) and, in turn, helping pull the industry back from the brink.

We continue to strongly follow his consensus-building foot steps that came to the fore during his tenure as Nigeria’s Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources during the late 1970s.

The President has been witness to many great moments in OPEC’s history, and Nigeria’s role in these. Our great country celebrates its 50-year anniversary of OPEC Membership in July this year. It has been both a leader and bridge builder over the past five decades, and this continues under President Muhammadu Buhari.

The ‘Petroleum Industry Bill’ that seeks to comprehensively reform Nigeria’s oil and gas industry is currently moving through the hallowed chambers of the National Assembly, and thus the ‘Decade of Gas’ is both timely and relevant.

The importance is also evident from OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO).

The WOO sees natural gas as the fastest-growing fossil fuel over the forecast period, driven by higher urbanization rates, industrial demand and its competiveness over coal in power generation.

Moreover, at the end of the WOO forecast period in 2045, oil and gas are still expected to make up over 50% of the global energy mix.

In fact, global primary energy demand is set to increase by 25% in the period to 2045. The world needs more energy and Nigeria, as a reliable and dependable supplier of hydrocarbons to global markets, has a key role to play in this regard.

At the same time, there is the ongoing energy transition and the associated challenge: ensuring there is enough energy supply to meet future demand growth, and achieving this in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy, and the environment?

Looking at the scale of the energy transition challenge, we need to utilize all resources.

Tackling emissions has many pathways and we need to explore them all. The oil and gas industries are part of the solution; we possess critical resources and expertise that can help unlock our carbon-free future.

It is also important to remind ourselves of the historic plunge in oil and gas investments in 2020. In the oil sector alone, upstream oil capital expenditure could fall by more than 30% in 2020, a shrill wake-up call, exceeding the annual dramatic declines seen in the severe industry downturn in 2015 and 2016.

To put this in some perspective, globally, to 2045, our projections show that investments of more than $12 trillion will be needed in the upstream, midstream and downstream.

I would like to commend the President for keeping faith with the requirements of continued heavy investments, including critical gas projects, such as the Ajaokuta–Kaduna–Kano Natural Gas Pipeline, the Nigeria LNG Train 7 project and actively promoting several fertilizer blending plants across the country, supporting the ongoing agrarian revolution.

Nigeria’s ‘Decade of Gas’ initiative also shines a beacon of light on the importance of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), and the value of multilateralism. OPEC and the GECF have much in common. We have some of the same Member Countries, including Nigeria, share similar founding principles, and collaborate together.

Gas is vital to Nigeria’s future, as is oil. And both will be fuels of choice globally for the foreseeable future and instrumental in facilitating the energy transition.

What is clear is that no-one should be left behind. Sustainable Development Goal number seven of the UN ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all people of the world.

I hope that viewpoints, information and analysis from this summit can benefit all stakeholders. It is by working together that we can build a future worthy of future generations.

On behalf of OPEC, I salute Mr President for taking yet another giant stride in the development of our great country Nigeria.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/24-29-march-2021.html"
"2021-02-17","Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to participate at the 11th IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks. The last edition of the symposium took place on the 19 February 2020. It would be something of an understatement to say that things have changed since then!

The great historian of the energy industry, Dan Yergin, said it most succinctly, when he wrote,

“The world seemed a different planet at the end of March [2020] from what it had been in the beginning of March [2020]… such a sudden, massive decline in oil demand that has never been seen before.”

First and foremost, we must remind ourselves that the COVID-19 pandemic has been a human tragedy. Almost 110 million people have been sickened by the virus, over 2.4 million have died, and millions of livelihoods have been destroyed. No region or sector has been spared.

Some commentators have noted that the energy industry may have been the most impacted of all sectors by the pandemic. As the world economy contracted by 4.1% in 2020, global oil demand declined by 9.7 mb/d.

The nadir of this annus horribilis came in April. Industry veterans saw things happen that they could never have imagined possible.

Oil demand plunged 22% during the month and on 20 April 2020, WTI went negative for the first time in history, with prices plummeting to -$37.

In response to this unprecedented situation, OPEC knew it had to act. Thankfully, we did not need to reinvent the wheel. We turned to the mechanism that had helped us emerge out of the 2015-2016 oil market downturn: the ‘Declaration of Cooperation.’

Together with our partners and ably supported by the Saudi Arabian Presidency of the G20, we agreed on 12 April 2020 to the largest and longest-in-duration production adjustments in the industry’s history.

Thereafter, participating countries have subsequently adjusted these decisions to proactively anticipate market developments, improve the core principles upon which our enterprise was founded (transparency, equity and fairness) and compensate for over-produced volumes. High conformity levels with these production adjustments have been testimony to the depth of our commitment.

Consequently, we have seen a recovery in the industry that has multiplier benefits for the global economy.

While there are grounds for optimism that 2021 will be the year of recovery, there are many uncertainties ahead. As the IMF recently stated,

“Much now depends on the outcome of this race between a mutating virus and vaccines to end the pandemic, and on the ability of policies to provide effective support until that happens. There remains tremendous uncertainty and prospects vary greatly across countries.”

Furthermore, other factors can have a disruptive impact on the energy industry. As the extreme weather in Texas has shown, we cannot take energy security for granted, even in a country like the US. An Arctic blast has disrupted electricity supply and demand has surged to record heights. Oil and gas production have plummeted by a third and 5 million people across the country face the freeze without heat or power.

The DoC partners are determined to play their part and provide that effective policy support. In doing so, we will always act in the interests of producers and consumers.

Excellencies,

Energy outlooks are an essential component of our Organizations’ work. Comprehensive, accurate and fact-based analysis is crucial in supporting policy-makers in taking informed decisions, especially in the current circumstances.

The pandemic has complicated the process of preparing energy outlooks. In such circumstances, this inter-agency forum has once again proven itself invaluable as a means to exchange data, analysis, information, on the short-, medium and longer-term outlooks. We can even ‘blow-off steam’ about the frustrations of preparing outlooks! The wisdom of the trilateral work programme adopted in Cancun in March 2010 is further vindicated by the need for dialogue, cooperation and engagement in challenging times!

Our outlooks are based on factual analysis, careful modelling, and detailed reasoning. While we are not in the business of predicting the future, we adopt methodologies grounded in rational scrutiny of the data.

Since we have enhanced collaboration between our Organizations, the quality of our output has improved exponentially. A clear indication of what we have achieved is reflected in regular technical meetings among the agencies to compare our projections and further improve the data quality and transparency. The achievements of the JODI to date is an illuminating example of this, as well as the analysis in the newly released IEF-RFF Outlooks Comparison Report that will be presented today.

This is crucial, particularly with regard to the energy transition, which seems to have multiple definitions depending on the perspective of the person talking about it! To recall the words of Dan Yergin again,

“‘Energy transition’ means different things to different nations, especially in the developing world. A billion people lack access to electricity; three billion do not have access to clean cooking fuels. Instead they burn wood or charcoal or crop waste or cow dung indoors, impairing their health. This leads to a different perspective.”

As the 14th edition of our OPEC World Oil Outlook, which was launched on October 8 of last year, stated, global primary energy demand is forecast to continue growing in the medium and long term, rising by a hefty 25% by 2045. Oil will remain the largest contributor to the energy mix in 2045 at 28%.

To meet this future demand, the global oil sector will need cumulative investment of $12.6 trillion in the upstream, midstream and downstream through to 2045. These investments are essential for both producers and consumers.

Underinvestment remains one of the great challenges for our industry and this was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of 2020, investments declined by 30%. We need to work towards creating an investment friendly climate.

Excellencies,

There is a common thread linking the cooperation between our Organizations; the DoC actions to restore market stability and the producer-consumer dialogue. It is something deeply ingrained in OPEC’s raison d’etre.

In our fast-changing and unpredictable world, we seek to contribute to greater stability, more predictability and enhanced transparency. We constantly seek to improve our capacity to do so, for we believe this will help us build a better future; one which serves the interests of generations of producers and consumers.

May this sense of purpose guide our discussions today and always.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/25-17-february-2021.html"
"2021-01-27","Ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning to our friends on the other side of the Atlantic, and good afternoon to everyone here in Europe.

It is a great pleasure to deliver this ‘Special Address’ at the S&P Global Platts Americas Petroleum and Energy Conference. I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation, and to all those who have taken time out from their busy schedules to listen in today.

I have been asked to speak about ‘the pursuit of global multilateralism to help drive the global energy transition’. It is a topic very close to my heart, and central to the Organization that I humbly lead as Secretary General.

Multilateralism has a long history, but it has perhaps never been more important to the world as we look build and shape today’s architectures for tomorrow. It will be vital for the energy transition, which is both a massive challenge and an enormous opportunity in the decades ahead.

To put it simply: we need to mould multilateralism and the energy transition into a form that delivers for each and every person on this planet.

For OPEC, what has been clear since it was founded back in Baghdad in September 1960 is the value placed on ever broadening dialogue and cooperation.

As an intergovernmental organization we have always been a proud member of the multilateral system. It is integral to our existence and central to our raison d'être.

The Founder Members acted in strict accordance with UN Principles and purposes in establishing OPEC and the very first resolution of the fledging Organization put dialogue front-and-centre.

Over the decades, this has expanded far and wide. Today, we have established productive dialogues with other international organizations such as the International Energy Agency, the International Energy Forum, the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, and cooperate and hold talks with the G20, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and various UN entities.

There are also a variety of constructive dialogues with major oil consumers and producers, such as the EU, India, China, the Russian Federation, as well as with a number of US energy industry stakeholders.

These relationships were particularly vital in 2020, in the face of the colossal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, something I will return to later.

It all underscores how OPEC is now an established part of the international energy community and the multilateral system.

In this regard, an outstanding example of the multilateral approach can be viewed through the prism of the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC), now in its fifth year, which has brought together 23 oil producing nations to help return balance to the market, and achieve a sustainable stability, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

It has helped the industry traverse two historic downturns. It has ushered in a new era in global energy cooperation.

Back at the start of 2017, the focus of the DoC was on returning balance and stability to the oil market in the aftermath of the devastating 2014-16 oil industry downturn.

The downturn had brought the industry to its knees. Nearly half a million people lost their jobs; an estimated one trillion dollars in investments were either frozen or deferred; a record number of companies filed for bankruptcy; and by July 2016 the OECD commercial stock overhang had soared to a record high of about 403 million barrels (mb) over the five-year industry average.

Over the subsequent three years, from 2017-2019, the diligent and coordinated response through voluntary production adjustment decisions taken by the DoC helped rebalance the market, restore stability and revive the industry.

When the year turned from 2019 to 2020, there was a great deal of optimism for the oil market in the coming 12 months. Not only for the oil market; the global economy too.

By March, however, the COVID-19 pandemic had pervaded almost every aspect of our daily lives, with widespread lockdowns, economies in major distress and many businesses shuttered in.

In terms of the oil and gas industry, every producer was impacted. No-one was immune.

The DoC had to again stand up and be counted. Action was needed, and act we did with the largest and longest production adjustments in the history of the OPEC, the DoC and the oil industry agreed on 12 April 2020 to help counter the massive oil demand decline that at times was above 20 mb/d in April.

The phased reductions in the adjustment levels over a two-year period demonstrated the full commitment of all participants a common goal.

I am sure each and every one of us can recall the dire situation the industry was in, which was most dramatically illustrated on 20 April 2020 when the price of WTI went negative. It was a visceral day, and one often described as ‘Black Monday’.

It was a time when the industry faced a potential crude oversupply of nearly 1.3 billion barrels. There were even deep concerns that some storage hubs could actually reach tank tops.

Thankfully, this never came to pass, in part due to the decisive actions of the DoC. Since then the DoC has shown great courage and flexibility and has adapted as and when necessary to changing market dynamics, particularly with the post-summer advent of second and third waves of COVID-19.

We have never been complacent. It has been one step-at-a-time, guided by the data and analysis and robustly supported by the strong multilateral process we have in place.

Another pivotal outcome of the April 2020 meetings has been the broader encouragement and support that DoC participants have received. This came from the very highest levels of government, from the G20 and from the very largest global oil producers, including Norway, US and Canada, as well as consumers.

This was further built on with OPEC comparing notes with US independents, a relationship that has blossomed since we first met in Houston in 2017; other producing nations, such as Norway, Colombia and Brazil; major consumers, such as China, India and the EU; and select energy policymakers and experts from international institutions, consulting firms, the oil industry, the financial community and think tanks from around the world.

There was an acknowledgement of our mutual interdependence, and the benefits of working together to return confidence and stability to the global oil market.

The DoC was at times a polestar for the oil market during some of the dark days of 2020; a multilateral approach helping guide the industry through stormy waters.

We also realize our work is not done. We have our eyes firmly fixed on 2021. It is clear the recovery has been fragile and uncertainties remain, particularly in terms of the pandemic. Vaccines offer some much needed light at the end of the tunnel, but the ever increasing number of COVID-19 cases, and sadly human loss, as well as renewed lockdowns, are a harsh reminder of how delicate the situation remains.

Nonetheless, we are cautiously optimistic for the global economic rebound in 2021, and for significant oil demand growth. But we will continue to take a month-by-month approach to assessing market conditions, and stand ready to take any necessary actions through the DoC.

In looking further ahead, oil market stability, and more broadly, energy market stability, will be vital to the energy transition.

Stability begets stability, and this will be essential to helping bring on board the huge investments required in the years ahead. Our World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2020 shows that $12.6 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream oil sectors.

To place this in some further context, our current assessments show that upstream capital expenditure could have fallen by more than 30% in 2020, beyond the 23% losses experienced in both 2015 and 2016.

If this is not rectified it could leave long-term scars, not only for producers, but consumers too.

The return of investments is a core objective of the DoC. And, of course, huge investments will be required across all energies.

The multilateral approach of the DoC has shown just what can be achieved by working together, but as I think we can all appreciate, the future will need the coalescing of a broader coalition to tackle the energy challenges in the years ahead.

What is clear to all of us is that the world will continue to need more energy in the decades ahead.

In the near-term, as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and looking longer term to 2045, as the global economy is expected to more than double in size, world population is projected to grow by over 1.7 billion people and given that we need to rid the world of the scourge of energy poverty, bringing light, heat, power, and low-emission fuels for cooking to billions that still go without.

There are obviously many facets to the future energy transition, but the basic challenge is simple: how can we ensure that there is enough energy supply to meet expected future demand growth, and how can this growth be achieved in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy, and the environment?

There are some who believe the oil and gas industries should not be part of the energy future, that they should be consigned to the past, and that the future is one that can be dominated by renewables and electric vehicles.

It is important to state clearly that the science does not tell us this, and the statistics related to the blight of energy poverty do not tell us this either.

We fully support the science. This is a given. We do not deny the existence of climate change. What the science and statistics tell us that we need to reduce emissions and use energy more efficiently.

Renewables are coming of age, with wind and solar expanding quickly, but – even by 2045 – in our WOO they are only estimated to make up just over 20% of the global energy mix. Oil and gas combined are forecast to still supply over 50% of the world’s energy needs by 2045, with oil at around 27% and gas at 25%.

We appreciate that some will view this as an OPEC forecast, dispute the numbers, and state that the Organization is against renewables.

In response, it is clear that many OPEC Member Countries have great solar and wind resources, and huge investments are being made in this field. OPEC welcomes the development of renewables. However, we do not see any reputable outlook projecting in their base cases that renewables will come anywhere close to overtaking oil and gas in the decades ahead.

In terms of electric vehicles, there is no doubt that they will continue to see expansion in the transportation sector. In our WOO, the share of electric vehicles in the total road transportation fleet is projected to expand to around 16% in 2045. We support their development in a sustainable manner.

However, for many of the world’s population, electric vehicles do not offer a viable alternative to the internal combustion engine, primarily due to cost. There is also debate about how environmentally friendly they are considering their build process, especially the required batteries, and the sourcing of the vehicles’ electricity.

Here, I think it is also relevant to highlight one key detail from our WOO. In the period to 2045, fuel efficiency improvements are expected to result in a far greater reduction in oil demand, than the increasing penetration of alternative fuel vehicles.

Looking at the scale of the challenge of the energy transition, we need to utilize all available energies, and it is crucial that we appreciate just what each energy source can provide in the decades ahead.

The challenge of tackling emissions has many paths and we need to explore them all. Complex problems require comprehensive solutions. The oil and gas industries are part of the solution; they possess critical resources and expertise that can help unlock our carbon-free future.

We need to look for cleaner and more efficient technological solutions everywhere, across all available energies. We will need a very broad portfolio of emission removal technologies to tackle climate change. We are believers that solutions can be found in technologies, such as carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) and others, as well in the promotion of the Circular Carbon Economy to improve overall environmental performance

It is vital that the required investments are made, in all energies, to ensure stable and continuous supplies, and to help reduce and, ultimately, eliminate emissions.

Without the necessary investments, there is the potential for further volatility and a future energy shortfall, which is not in the interests of either producers or consumers.

Moreover, if billions of people in the developing world suffering from a lack of energy access feel they are excluded from access to energies that have helped fuel the developed world, then this could sow further divisions and expand the divide between the haves and have nots, the global North and the South.

Let me be clear: nobody should be left behind in the energy transition. Sustainable Development Goal number seven of the UN ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all people – not just for a select group.

OPEC and its Member Countries have been directly involved in the evolution of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement and fully support the multilateral approach to addressing climate change and the energy transition. The core elements of the UNFCCC, particularly equity, historical responsibility and national circumstances must be considered at all junctures moving forward.

At OPEC, we welcome coordinated action and engagement with all stakeholders in the energy community. We also believe we have a perfect vehicle – the Charter of Cooperation (CoC). The CoC is open to all producers and offers a platform to address issues such as climate change, the energy transition and energy access in a coherent and inclusive way.

OPEC reaffirms its faith – time and time again – of the need for dialogue, cooperation, and respect.

We need to talk to each other and not at each other. We need to work with each other and not against each other.

This was perfectly illustrated by UN Secretary General, António Guterres, the world’s leading advocate for multilateral engagement. He said:

“I'm not a multilateralist against anybody. I'm a multilateralist because I believe in a multilateral order.”

Multilateralism is a means to discuss, reason and lay a path forward for us all. The challenges our planet faces require solutions from every corner of society – developed and developing nations. No-one can act alone.

That is not to say that multilateralism is easy. It is not. It is often complicated, but it is the only possible response. We need to keep on communicating and keep on partnering.

Looking across the Atlantic, we believe that we have established mutually beneficial and productive relationships with the oil industry in the US, as well as in Canada. We have much in common and we hope to further deepen these bonds in the years ahead.

The US is a vital cog in the global oil market, as both a major producer and consumer.

We also welcome the swift decision of the Biden administration to return to the Paris Agreement. The energy transition and the global conversation around it would be incomplete without the US at the head of the multilateral table.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We are all dedicated and passionate about evolving a sustainable energy future for all, and in this we need to leverage all available resources.

It is our deeply held conviction that dialogue and action on this matter should be inclusive and broad to try and evolve this energy transition in the least disruptive manner.

We need to think carefully about what an energy transition actually means; and we all need to follow the right paths.

Working together, through a multilateral approach, we can build a future worthy of future generations and one where no one is left behind.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/26-27-january-2021.html"
"2021-01-04","Your Highness,

Excellencies,

Distinguished delegates,

Good day, happy new year, and welcome to the 13th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

It is a pleasure for me to chair this meeting, my first as President of the OPEC Conference, as we begin yet another new and very exciting chapter in the history of the Declaration of Cooperation.

Allow me to begin by thanking His Royal Highness Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia, and Alexander Novak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation for their inspiring remarks, their leadership and their tireless dedication to our cause.

I thank my predecessor as President of the OPEC Conference, HE Abdelmadjid Attar, Algeria’s Minister of Energy, for so ably guiding us through many difficult months in 2020.

I also extend a warm welcome to HE Dr Mohammad Alfares, Kuwait’s new Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity and Water, and to thank his predecessor, Dr Khaled A. Al-Fadhel, for his dedication to OPEC and to the Declaration of Cooperation process.

I wish to express my appreciation to HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC’s hard-working Secretary General, and the entire staff of the OPEC Secretariat, for ensuring the full and efficient operation of the Secretariat throughout the past year. I am aware that Vienna is now under its third lockdown and strict containment measures continue day and night. The entire team at the Secretariat have carried out their duties with diligence and supported our meetings despite the challenging circumstances, and they deserve special commendation from us all.

Your Highness,

Excellencies,

Distinguished delegates,

My country, Angola, is one of the newest OPEC Member Countries, having joined in 2007. By being part of the OPEC family, we have not only strengthened our capacity and expertise. We have also gained stature and influence on the global stage.

Angola is proud to have engaged directly in the decision-making process that led our great Organization to expand the scope of collaboration through the Declaration of Cooperation.

The benefits of the Declaration of Cooperation were clear enough in the wake of the 2014-2016 market crisis – it helped restore market confidence and stability, and it paved the way for the Charter of Cooperation in 2019, giving us a new platform for collaboration beyond the important market-balancing process.

Last year, however, was truly a defining moment for our cause.

Since the decisive 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC meeting last April, we have taken unprecedented steps to prevent a market collapse; restore stability; and breathe new life into the industry. Rarely in the history of crude oil have we witnessed such swift, decisive and determined action to help put the market on the road to recovery.

I believe all the OPEC and non-OPEC countries here today can be proud of what we did – together – in the face of an unprecedented crisis. World leaders, oil majors and energy stakeholders everywhere turned to us to take the lead.

And lead we did.

The past year has not been easy for any of us. COVID-19 has been a blow to our economies; it has torn deep holes in budgets; it has significantly set back investment plans. OPEC’s projections for 2021 – crude oil demand growth in the neighbourhood of 5.9 million barrels per day – are a welcome turn of events from last year’s market devastation.

However, with global demand expectations of around 96 million barrels per day, we are 4 million short of the Secretariat’s pre-pandemic projections for 2020. 96 million barrels per day is a throwback to demand levels we saw in 2016, when the Declaration of Cooperation began.

I am reassured by signs that economic growth will resume, but there are risks that it could be uneven.

Our African economies, for example, lack the financial firepower to undertake stimulus programmes on the scale we have seen in other countries, particularly those in the OECD. The storm surges of this crisis could be stronger in some regions than in others, and more long-lasting – thus creating uncertainties for oil demand.

Your Highness,

Excellencies,

Distinguished delegates,

As we start a new year, we also begin an important new phase in our production adjustments. We are transitioning from managing the crisis to supporting the global recovery.

We have made impressive progress on conformity, with the overall conformity level standing at 101%, especially in the final quarter of 2020. The strength of the Declaration of Cooperation, and of our efforts to support the market, depend upon 100% percent conformity and achieving compensation for overproduction.

We are here today because we recognize that the challenge is greater and inherently more complex than any single country, producer or company can shoulder. We all stand to benefit when we stand together – and stay the course together.

I again want to thank the OPEC Secretariat for providing the most up-to-date data and technical coordination that enable us to make the right decisions, at the right time.

In closing, let me say again that Angola is proud to be a part of this market-leading effort and the contributions we are making, shoulder-to-shoulder with all the OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries. We are working to help restore stability and confidence in the oil market not just for those present here today, but in the longer-term interest of consumers, investors and the global economy.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/27-4-january-2021.html"
"2021-01-04","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Welcome to the first OPEC+ ministerial meeting of 2021.

I wish you all a very happy New Year.

I would like to recognize the work of the co-chair, Alexander Novak, deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, whose continued dedication and leadership have, once more, been vital in helping us progress towards our goals.

Allow me to welcome HE Mohammed Abdullatif al-Fares, the energy minister of Kuwait, and give thanks for the work of his predecessor, Khaled al-Fadhel.

I also want to welcome the HE Diamantino Pedro Azevedo, Minister of Mineral Resources, Petroleum and Gas of Angola, as he assumes the OPEC presidency.

Our thanks are due to HE Abdelmadjid Attar for his sterling work and leadership during his time as President.

As ever, I thank the OPEC Secretariat for the ongoing support provided to these meetings.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I am sure that each of us has a story to tell of the rollercoaster ride we experienced, and of the trials and tribulations we faced in the year just gone.

But when the historians look back on this period, we should hope they write a big chapter on the extraordinary successes OPEC+ has achieved in 2020, in the face of such acute adversity.

Not only did we achieve the biggest ever cuts to oil supply, but we also saw those cuts through, in a disciplined and united manner, that said a lot about the effectiveness of our joint efforts.

We achieved the highest levels of conformity in the four years OPEC+ has been operating, and for the first time we agreed a mechanism for compensation to make up for any past slippage from our goals.

Let’s hope we can continue to build on the past year’s momentum, and succeed in achieving full compensation.

Our collaborative approach has helped us go a long way towards rebalancing global oil markets after the shocks of last year.

But now, as we see light at the end of the tunnel, we must - at all costs - avoid the temptation to slacken off our resolve.

It is true that the arrival of several vaccines against the COVID-19 virus is a very welcome sign.

I said before that vaccination would be the single most important factor in bringing about economic recovery, leading to a sustained improvement in demand for oil.

We have seen this in the general return to optimism within the market since the first vaccines were authorized late last year.

But, at the risk of being seen as a killjoy in the proceedings, I want to urge caution, even in this generally optimistic environment.

The level of uncertainty in the world remains high.

Global oil demand is still well short of where it was at the beginning of the year. Demand for transport fuels, in particular aviation fuel, is especially fragile.

The new variant of the disease is a worrying and unpredictable development.

In many parts of the world, where infection rates have increased worryingly, a new wave of lockdowns and restrictions are being put in place, which will inevitably impact the rate of economic recovery in those countries.

So I urge you today NOT to take for granted the progress we have made as a group over the past year.

Do not put at risk all that we have achieved for the sake of an instant, but illusory, benefit.

As well as caution, I also urge a sense of responsibility - because our job is not yet done, and there is plenty of hard effort still to be undertaken.

We must remain vigilant and proactive in the face of any unwelcome developments.

As we agreed at the last meeting, we must retain the flexibility to respond to events as they occur and make the necessary adjustments to attend to the markets’ needs.

We should make every effort to achieve both full compliance and full compensation.

There is no room for complacency.

The markets have rewarded our determined efforts of the past year, but now is not the time to rest on our laurels.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/28-4-january-2021.html"
"2021-01-03","Mr Chairman,

Mr Co-Chairman,

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me wish you and all our colleagues a happy new year, and congratulate you all for your hard work in 2020. You deserve very warm applause.

I would also like to express my appreciation to the OPEC Secretariat staff for continuing to do their utmost to meet all their targets and deliverables, and for supporting these meetings. I also thank you for working on a Sunday.

It has now been a year since the first human case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. How time flies.

Mr Chairman, I first heard of this virus upon arriving at the airport in Saudi Arabia one year ago today. The rapid progression of the virus since then has caused agonizing human loss and infected many millions of people across the world, including some of our dear colleagues.

This morning I saw that more than 83 million people have now been affected and 1.8 million have lost their lives to the coronavirus. I am very moved by the dedication of those who have overcome this terrible virus, and returned to work with a renewed sense of purpose.

Tomorrow, we begin a new chapter in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) with the start of monthly OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings to evaluate the market.

It was only one year ago that the DoC participating countries began to introduce adjustments of a then-astonishing 1.7 million b/d, with additional voluntary contributions pushing that number to 2.1 million b/d.

How times have changed.

These adjustments, as agreed at the 7th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in December 2019, were a pre-emptory response to support continued stability in 2020, actions that were welcomed widely as the market rang in a new and promising year. Looking back at the projections provided by the JTC, I don’t think anyone could have done a better job.

In retrospect, those efforts taken at the end of 2019 pale in comparison to the scope and scale of the actions we have carried out since a series of ground-breaking Ministerial Meetings in April, June, and culminating in the visionary decisions taken at the last meeting one month ago today.

The outcome of the December 3rd Ministerial Meeting paved the way for a gradual return of 2 million b/d to the market over the coming months, while the participating countries stand ready to adjust these levels depending on market conditions and developments.

Collectively over the last nine months, we have delivered an unprecedented response to an unparalleled market shock and continue to lead the industry on the road to recovery.

Mr Chairman,

Mr Co-Chairman,

Ladies and gentlemen,

We are witnessing the very early stages of COVID-19 vaccinations and the progress so far has injected optimism into the economy. These promising developments, in parallel with the Declaration of Cooperation’s market leadership during the crisis, have contributed to a healthier oil market outlook for 2021.

Following the last Ministerial Meetings, the price of Brent crude inched above $50 per barrel for the first time since early March, while Brent crude and US West Texas Intermediate experienced their longest stretch of advances since June.

After the unprecedented shock experienced last year, the economic forecast calls for brighter days ahead. Our analysts expect the global economy to grow by 4.4 per cent in 2021 compared to a sharp contraction of around 4.2 per cent last year. The COVID-19 vaccinations provide upside potential for the economic outlook and may help usher in a strong rebound in the second half of 2021.

Furthermore, we continue to see upward momentum in Asia, especially China, which remains on course for positive growth in 2020 – a singular achievement among the world’s bigger economies. China’s broad-based recovery forecast stands at about 6.9 per cent for 2021 and provides a beacon of hope for other economies, in the region and beyond.

Our analysts in the Secretariat anticipate that crude oil demand will shift from reverse to forward gear and rise to 95.9 million b/d this year, a gain of 5.9 million b/d from 2020. The non-OECD will be in the driver’s seat with growth of around 3.3 million b/d.

These projections are a move in the right direction, but there is a wide valley separating this outlook from the Secretariat’s pre-pandemic forecast. Before the current crisis, at around this time last year, we expected demand reaching 102 million b/d in 2021 – 6 million b/d more than the current projections.

I am, however, encouraged by the positive momentum in the energy commodity markets, with crude oil prices up by around $7 per barrel or 17 per cent since our last meeting.

Amid the hopeful signs, the outlook for the first half of 2021 is very mixed and there are still many downside risks to juggle. We are only beginning to emerge from a year of deep investment cuts, huge job losses and the worst crude oil demand destruction on record.

Curbs on social and economic activity remain in place in a number of countries, and there is concern about the emergence of a pernicious new strain of the virus. Last night I saw on the news there are now about 30 countries that have reported this new strain.

Though the ongoing restrictions are necessary to combat the pandemic, they have chipped away at business sentiment and consumer confidence in some of the world’s biggest economies. It is too early to tell how quickly key sectors will bounce back to their pre-pandemic growth trajectories even if the vaccines defeat this terrible virus.

Mr Chairman, sectorally, travel, tourism, leisure and hospitality continue to be affected. Our projections show that there will be rebound in the second half of 2021 with upside potential. However, it could be another a couple of years before these sectors bounce back to pre-COVID levels, with corresponding lagging impact on oil demand.

The Christmas Eve trade agreement between the UK and EU is a promising development for the recovery process after months of very difficult and rancorous negotiations.

Stimulus packages have clearly helped prevent deeper economic contractions and continue to lend crucial recovery support. The EU and US have now approved measures which, taken together, provide nearly $2 trillion in additional support for those economies. It is worth noting that fiscal and monetary stimulus packages in the G20, including bank guarantees, have reached $25 trillion, corresponding to more than 20 per cent of the global economy.

Finally, inventory levels show positive momentum – though they remain stubbornly high. Preliminary November data shows total OECD commercial oil stocks fell by around 24.8 million barrels m-o-m. The current levels are more than 205 million barrels higher than the same time one year ago and about 163 million barrels above the latest five-year average. Seesawing stock levels dented market momentum heading into the year-end holidays, and outside the OECD, inventories remain well above average levels.

As we turn an eye to this year, we can only speculate on how the social and working habits developed out of necessity last year will ultimately affect important areas such as mobility over the longer term. Furthermore, the new strain of the virus is a harsh reminder of how delicate the situation remains after a year of human loss, economic shock, and historic oil market destruction.

The open questions about the future point to the need for the DoC participating countries to stay the course and remain faithful to our commitment to full conformity, and to compensate for earlier overproduction.

Mr Chairman,

Mr Co-Chairman,

Ladies and gentlemen,

I know there have been occasional differences of opinion in fine-tuning the production adjustments, and this is to be expected for such an abnormally difficult and in-depth crisis. It is a sign of our enduring success that we continue to work in tandem to find common ground to tackle uncommon challenges.

We are most fortunate that the architects of the DoC constructed a framework so solid that it allows us to be agile and flexible, to act in a timely way to support market stability as different conditions arise. The positive outcomes of the 12th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting are a reflection of the DoC’s visionary and adaptable structure.

We are now into the fifth year of the Declaration of Cooperation and better equipped than ever as we shift from managing a crisis to supporting the recovery.

We continue to benefit from the endurance, patience and commitment gained since the historic decision to create the DoC in response to the severe downturn of 2014 to 2016.

The DoC participating countries have shown without hesitation that we are ready, willing and able to work together to help sustain oil market stability – and this explains why so many global energy stakeholders have been looking to us for guidance.

Looking back, December 2020 was not simply the last month of a horrific year. It was a month of important milestones for the DoC. It was the fourth year since the Declaration was signed on December 10th 2016, and the Ministerial Meeting on December 3rd capped a year of historic actions by the participating countries.

Mr Chairman, I would be remiss today if I did not draw on the fountain of wisdom of Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī:

“The wound is the place where the light enters you.”

Our industry has certainly endured its share of wounds over the past year, and the scars may remain for some time to come. But through our teamwork and collective endeavours, we have helped provide the light that will see us through to better years ahead.

Mr Chairman, I look forward, as always, to a productive meeting today and throughout this new year of 2021.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/29-3-january-2021.html"
"2020-12-17","Excellencies, Mr. Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a real pleasure to speak at the 31st Meeting of the Energy Charter Conference.

Allow me to begin by paying tribute to the indefatigable President Ilham Aliyev, the Government and people of Azerbaijan for their recent efforts that will contribute to pave the way for stability and prosperity in the whole region. These decisive efforts will hopefully lead towards finding a lasting solution that has been long awaited.

I would also like to congratulate my dear friend, HE Parviz Shahbazov, Minister of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Chair of the Energy Charter Conference, for doing such an outstanding job in chairing this conference at such a historic moment.

Azerbaijan’s Chairmanship is a fitting demonstration of the country’s commitment to the promotion of dialogue between cultures. Throughout the world, Azerbaijan is recognised as a centre of multiculturalism. This is clear through the ‘Baku Process’ launched in 2008 to strengthen inter-cultural dialogue and the World Forum on Intercultural Dialogue held every two years in Azerbaijan.

Furthermore, Azerbaijan is the cradle of the oil industry.

Azerbaijan was the location of many “firsts” in the historic development of our industry. In 1846, more than a decade before ‘Colonel’ Edwin L. Drake struck oil on American soil for the first time, a 21 meter well was drilled in Bibi-Heybat for oil exploration--the first successfully drilled oil well in human history. Within three decades of the first oil well being drilled in 1846, the world witnessed the building of the first wooden oil derrick in 1871, the first distillery in 1876 and the first oil tanker ship in 1877- all in Azerbaijan- truly the cradle of the oil industry.

At OPEC, we know first-hand about Azerbaijani statesmanship. Azerbaijan has been a pivotal member of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ since its inception in 2016. President Aliyev was the first world leader to publically call upon OPEC and non-OPEC countries to close ranks and collaborate in order to rescue the oil industry. His visionary leadership honours his country’s incredible history.

Minister Parviz Shahbazov has continuously been a forger of consensus, widely admired by the entire DoC family for his wise interventions, diplomatic skill and depth of knowledge of the energy industry. At OPEC, we feel very fortunate to have such a friend and partner.

OPEC’s relationship with the Energy Charter Secretariat goes from strength to strength. Earlier this year, we convened the First OPEC-Energy Charter Secretariat-OPEC Fund Annual Legal Workshop. We were honoured to learn from the wise words of my colleague and friend HE Dr. Urban Rusnák, Secretary General of the Energy Charter Secretariat.

This is just one way in which we hope our cooperation can continue to expand in the future.

We commend the chair for the judicious selection of the topic of this conference, ‘Energy Efficiency for all: Innovations and Investments.’ Azerbaijan and the Energy Charter Secretariat have worked well together on this critical issue, including through the Energy Charter Secretariat’s ‘In-Depth Review of the Energy Efficiency Policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan,’ prepared in 2019. This helped the development of an energy strategy and the preparation of Azerbaijan’s first national Energy Efficiency Action Plan.

At OPEC, we recognise the importance of energy efficiency as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while allowing for sustainable development.

Dan Yergin, the great historian of our industry described energy efficiency as the “energy resource that has the potential to have the biggest impact of all.” If we look at OPEC’s recently published World Oil Outlook 2020, oil demand in the transportation is an illustrative example. Between 2019 and 2045, improved fuel efficiency is expected to be responsible for a decline in demand of 8.6 mb/d. In the OECD, this will be 4.4. mb/d. In both cases, this amounts to more demand reduction than that achieved by penetration by alternative fuel vehicles.

It is worth recalling that energy efficiency requires efficiency improvements in both demand and supply. It is often said that digitalization is one of the most effective means of unlocking energy efficiency improvements. OPEC is extremely supportive of measures to improve data transparency, particularly through our proactive role in the Joint Organizations Data Initiative. Additionally, we organise a multitude of meetings with our partners on the issue of data transparency, including with the IEA and IEF, as well as secondary source reporting agencies. Our aim is to constantly improve the accuracy and timeliness of data.

We also believe that dialogue between consumers and producers is critical to improving efficiency. For this reason, we have an extensive range of formalised, international dialogues with a broad range of partners. These offer indispensable platforms for exchanging views, providing clarity and finding mutually beneficial solutions.

Ladies and gentlemen,

This conference is being convened in extraordinary circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause serious disruption across the globe. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Azerbaijan for the vigorous and proactive measures taken in combatting COVID-19. In May of this year, the WHO described as Azerbaijan an ‘exemplary country’ in the fight against the pandemic. Azerbaijan’s voluntary contributions to the WHO are astounding. Azerbaijan has provided humanitarian and financial assistance to over 30 countries, during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pandemic has underscored how unity and efficiency are required in response to these unprecedented times. The oil demand destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic greatly imperilled our industry, which threatened to present even greater challenges to the global economy.

To help counter the situation, OPEC and our DoC partners agreed at two Extraordinary Meetings on April 9 and 12 to new voluntary production adjustments, beginning with 9.7 mb/d, in May and June 2020, which was extended to July. Moreover, the tailored adjustments would also run two years until April 2022. Azerbaijan, ably represented by Minister Shahbazov, played a critical role in ensuring the adoption of these decisions, by ably deploying his immense diplomatic skills and acumen during these contentious moments.

These supply adjustments are the largest and longest in the history of OPEC and the oil industry.

The adjustments were subsequently ‘enhanced’ at the 11th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 6 June, indicative of our adaptability. We also agreed to a compensation mechanism for Participating Countries for underperformed volumes.

On, December 3, 2020, at the 12th OPEC and Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, participating countries unanimously agreed to a further flexible implementation of the DoC voluntary production adjustments in the first quarter of 2021. In light of the current oil market fundamentals and the outlook for 2021, we agreed to reconfirm the existing commitment under the DoC decision from 12 April 2020, then amended in June and September 2020, to gradually return 2 mb/d, given consideration to market conditions. We decided to voluntary adjust production by 0.5 mb/d from 7.7 mb/d to 7.2 mb/d beginning in January 2021. Furthermore, we agreed to hold monthly OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meetings starting January 2021 and we extended the compensation mechanism to the end of March 2021.

The objective behind our actions is the pursuit of a sustainable stable market in the interests of producers and consumers. This is essential to attract the levels of investment necessary to meet the oil demand of the future. According to OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2020, the global oil sector will need cumulative investment of $12.6 trillion in the upstream, midstream and downstream through to 2045. These investments will be vital for improving the efficiency of the industry.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Allow me to conclude by once again reiterating OPEC’s support for the noble goals at the heart of the Energy Charter Conference. We hope cooperation between our two Organizations will continue to grow from strength to strength.

Although we cannot, in the current circumstances, meet in Baku, may the spirit of this great multicultural city; a city of intercultural dialogue and the birthplace of the oil and gas industry; inspire this meeting today and all our discussions going forward.

Thank you for your kind attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/30-17-december-2020.html"
"2020-12-08","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, fellow compatriots,

I am deeply honoured to have been granted the title of Honorary Conference Chairman for the virtual 19th Nigeria Oil and Gas Conference, a legacy of the great minds of Nigeria’s Dr. Rilwanu Lukman and Venezuela’s Dr. Alirio Parra, of blessed memory.

These two legendary OPEC and oil industry icons, had a vision to inspire the next generation of industry leaders, and the fruits of this vision can be viewed through the conference we are all part of today.

I would like to thank you for convening this conference at such challenging times, when hosting such events has made meeting in person impossible. I am very pleased that despite the unforeseen and difficult circumstances, you have been able to preserve continuity through videoconferencing. I hope we can join together face-to-face again very soon.

This conference has evolved over many years, rising in prestige and prominence. Today, it is a crucial event on the energy calendar, for Nigeria, Africa, OPEC and the world.

I would like to begin by paying tribute to whom tribute is due President Muhammadu Buhari, the government and my fellow Nigerian compatriots for their heroic efforts in confronting and combating the global health and economic crisis as a result of the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.

The government rose to the challenge with virus containment measures, campaigns to sensitize the population to the devastating impacts of the pandemic, and in promptly providing much needed stimulus to the economy. The government’s proactive response with economic stimulus packages helped protect the economy from a more severe contraction.

The economic contraction in the second and third quarters was not as much as had been originally anticipated, and considering the drop in revenues over this period, the government’s measures have helped minimize the effects of the economic downturn.

Nigerian crude oil export earnings plunged by 77% within three months between January to April 2020, but since then they have gradually improved and rebounded by 116% in November compared to April 2020 levels.

The government should be applauded for its quick and robust actions.

From the perspective of OPEC, I would also wish to express our deep gratitude to President Buhari, who has long been an advocate of OPEC in its overarching commitment to market stability.

All of us in the OPEC family know the enormous debt of gratitude we owe President Buhari for the pivotal role he has played in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) process between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries. Particularly his interventions at the highest level to secure the decisions at the 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in April 2020.

These decisions were taken in response to the unprecedented demand slump resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. OPEC and our non-OPEC DoC partners agreed over two Extraordinary Meetings on April 9 and 12 to new voluntary production adjustments, which are the largest and longest in the history of OPEC and the oil industry.

The President’s inspirational leadership, visionary courage and diplomatic judgement were instrumental in bringing together OPEC and non-OPEC countries and reaching consensus. He has consistently shown his impeccable credentials as a bastion of the principles underpinning international relations: respect for all nations, fulfilling one’s responsibilities, transparency and fairness.

We thank the President most sincerely for his contribution to ensuring that the DoC evolved from a noble vision to a transformative force-for-good, which has had a profoundly positive impact on the global oil industry.

Nigeria is consistently regarded as one of the most admired and respected Members of the OPEC family, particularly in the realm of consensus-building. For his contribution to making this the case, I would like to pay tribute to His Excellency Timipre Silva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources. He is a man of timbre and calibre, bringing his wisdom and experience to the process, for which we are all appreciative of.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The year 2020 will definitely leave a lasting impact on the hearts and minds of people for years and decades to come. The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects came as a shock to us all and is unprecedented in its disruption of the lives of everyone on the planet — and all in such a short space of time.

Today we face a new wave of infections and renewed lockdowns in many regions of the world. The world economy and oil market were on a positive trajectory coming into the year of 2020, but that feels like long ago now.

Let me quote from OPEC’s January 2020 Monthly Oil Market Report published at the beginning of this year. In that report, global economic growth was at a positive 3.1% for 2020. For this year, total world oil demand was projected to rise from 99.77 mb/d in 2019 to 100.98 mb/d.

Only a few weeks later the world plunged into an unparalleled health crisis that has had severe implications on every aspect of our lifes. The economy plunged into a deep recession.

The global economy is now forecast to shrink by 4.3% in 2020; all OECD economies are forecast to see a contraction, and all countries in Africa are anticipated to see a drop in GDP too. China is the only major economy expected to witness growth in 2020.

Millions of jobs were also lost as lockdowns took hold, with the OECD seeing unemployment more than double to 10% in 2020, and the commodity market — including oil — virtually collapsed overnight, with demand dropping up to 30% in the lowest moments in April.

The headwinds we have faced in the oil industry, and as humankind, have at times seemed nearly insurmountable.

We hope to never again experience a day like ‘Black Monday’ – when West Texas Intermediate crashed by $56/b into negative territory in the futures market for the first time ever on April 20, 2020, reaching an incredible -37.6/b. Our latest estimations for the year 2020 see overall oil demand contracting by 9.8 mb/d to average 90 mb/d, an overall loss of about 10%.

Ladies and gentlemen,

There is an African proverb that states: “Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors.” This unparalleled situation required quick and decisive action, and our DoC partners rose to the occasion boldly and proactively in April 2020. This helped reduce volatility and stabilize the oil market, and created a platform for recovery for the coming months and years.

The unprecedented decisions taken at the 9th and 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial meetings provided a rock for the oil market to hold to, helping alleviate the acute imbalance in the market and calming the extreme volatility.

The decisions were historic both in magnitude and duration, with initial adjustments nearly five times more than those made during the last downturn in 2014-2016. The two-year time frame implemented also showed recognition that the situation would not turn around overnight and would require diligence and continuous support. It was also a sign of the sheer dedication of the DoC participating countries.

Just last Thursday on December 3, our Member Countries and participants in the DoC proved once again that we are cohesive, committed and collaborative. The 12th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting decided to reconfirm the existing commitment of the DoC decision from April 12, amended in June and September 2020, and to gradually return 2 mb/d to the market, with effect from 1 January 2021.

Starting in January 2021, participating countries will adjust production by 500,000 tb/d from 7.7 mb/d to 7.2 mb/d. Additionally, the meeting decided to hold monthly OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings starting in January 2021 to assess market conditions and determine further production adjustments on a month-by-month basis. The compensation period for over-production by DoC participating countries was also extended until the end of March 2021 to ensure full compensation.

The oil market responded immediately in a positive manner, with statements made that the actions reinforce the conviction that the DoC is focused on maintaining its steady and stable course through 2021.

These responsible and measured decisions ensure regular consultations and incremental production adjustments so that DoC participants remain vigilant and agile to prevailing uncertainties. In this way, sharp output changes that may destabilize the oil market will be avoided.

Distinguished delegates,

A silver lining to the horrific COVID-19 situation has been witnessed in the engagement, commitment and support throughout the year by other major producers, as well as at the highest policy levels. Solidarity to this degree — international, governmental and from the oil industry — constitutes a marvel in and of itself. We have been witnessing the triumph of multilateralism.

The bold decisions by DoC participating countries also garnered the support of the G20 Extraordinary Energy Ministers Meeting of 10 April 2020, which stressed the importance of working together “in the spirit of solidarity”. It further acknowledged the commitment and sacrifice of the DoC participating countries in stabilizing energy markets and clearly acknowledged the vital importance of international cooperation in ensuring the resilience of energy systems.

Thus, at the 10th Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting of the DoC, all major oil producers were requested to provide timely contributions to support stabilization of the oil market. This call was taken up by many non-DoC countries, who pledged to help where possible. This included contributions from some countries, as well as production shut-ins in other places such as North America due to bursting storage facilities. The adjustments from Brazil, Canada, Norway, the US, and other countries added up to an additional minimum of 4 mb/d.

At this time, tank-top for inventories had become an urgent concern, with floating storage also filling up. OPEC data now show that without the decisive action by so many countries, led by the DoC, the market collapse would have been far more serious.

In fact, between May and October, participating OPEC and non-OPEC countries contributed to reducing the global supply by approximately 1.6 billion barrels, including voluntary adjustments. This has been key to market rebalancing.

The decisions taken in response to this world-scale calamitous event was a clear manifestation of the open dialogue and multilateral approach, which benefits producers, consumers, and the world economy at large.

Distinguished delegates,

The DoC between OPEC and non-OPEC producers was agreed back on the 10 December 2016, and has now proved decisive in helping the oil market confront two downturns. In fact, the earlier work of the DoC was excellent preparation for the much bigger disaster that befell the world economy and oil industry in the year of COVID-19. DoC members had already worked together and consolidated relationships. Monitoring bodies and architecture were tried and tested.

Another African proverb states: “If you make friends with the boatman in the dry season, you will be the first to cross when the rains come and the tide is high.”

The maturity of this cooperation, with its friendships and trust, gave us the ability to engage quickly and effectively in a way that would not have been possible if the DoC had not already existed.

While this year has been a bleak one, interspersed with positives, such as the role of the DoC, it is also important to take a look at the future.

Despite second waves of the pandemic and spreading lockdowns in several regions, the recent announcements of COVID-19 vaccines has already provided much hope and driven positive sentiment. However, we also realize we cannot get ahead of ourselves. Our recent decisions have been cautious — we have been careful to avoid a supply overrun under fragile market conditions and pandemic-bound risks.

The year 2021 certainly looks brighter, with preparation underway for widespread delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Once this process is in motion, the global economy and oil demand are expected to progress in leaps and bounds.

Looking even further up the road, this year’s recently released World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2020 provides the OPEC Secretariat’s in-depth look at the unprecedented scale and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global energy and oil markets, and for the first time extends out to 2045.

From the WOO, I draw the following promising figures: after a large drop in 2020, global primary energy demand is forecast to continue growing in the long term, increasing by a significant 25% in the period to 2045.

The key drivers of this demand are the more than doubling of GDP from $121 trillion in 2019 to more than $258 trillion in 2045 and the addition of around 1.7 billion people worldwide by 2045 to a level of close to 9.5 billion. Other demographic factors also figure into this, including urbanization and a growing middle class, particularly in developing countries.

The petroleum sector will remain the secure base in meeting global energy needs. This view is widely shared by other leading agencies. We expect oil to retain the largest share of the energy mix throughout the forecast period, providing nearly 28% of global requirements in 2045, followed by gas at around 25% and coal at around 20%.

Regionally, an evolutionary shift in demand will continue from developed to developing regions, including Africa. Clearly, all forms of energy will be needed to support the post-pandemic recovery on this continent and beyond, along with addressing long-term energy needs, so that no one will be left behind.

However, there will be long-term scars from this most recent downturn, including in investment. Our current assessments show that upstream capital expenditure could fall by more than 30% this year, beyond the 23% losses experienced in both 2015 and 2016. Our WOO shows that $12.6 trillion will be required between now and 2045 in the upstream, midstream and downstream. We are alarmed at the pull back of capital from the industry. We must all be proactive in pushing for policy discussions on energy and ensure that oil remains a key part of energy’s diversified portfolio to avoid a future energy crisis.

Distinguished delegates,

We at OPEC are working continuously to enhance our ties with Africa. This also supports OPEC’s medium- and long-term goals regarding energy poverty eradication and the continued use of conventional oil.

In recent years, more African oil producers have been joining or re-joining OPEC — including most recently Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, in addition to members Algeria, Angola, Libya and Nigeria. We would like to intensify our focus on the continent. Africa’s potential regarding energy and sustainable development is impressive, and we hope to help unlock it together.

Africa's oil industry holds huge untapped potential. The continent was home to nearly 8.0 mb/d of production in 2019, just below 10% of world output. At the end of last year, Africa was estimated to have proven reserves of oil of around 126 billion barrels, with Nigeria’s proven crude oil reserves at the end of 2019 alone standing at around 36.9 billion barrels, corresponding to more than 29% of the reserves on the African continent.

There are vast possibilities to achieve more in terms of production. Local production could in turn be used in a win-win scenario to alleviate the energy poverty facing millions on the continent.

Many, if not most, African countries face severe energy shortages, which holds back industrial development. With the continent’s tremendous conventional and renewable energy potential, this need not be the case.

According to OPEC data, the world’s deficit in global electrification is concentrated mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 47% of the population have no electricity. Additionally, the number of people without access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking in this region has further increased as a result of fast population growth. About 85% of people lack access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.

Along with meeting the continent’s own energy demands, which is vital to development and growth, we hope to see the continent diversify within the petroleum sector to stimulate the job market and help protect economies.

We cannot forget the second great scourge facing mankind today: climate change. Along with being harder hit by the fallout of COVID-19 due to starting from a less secure economic base, African countries stand to also disproportionately suffer from the consequences of climate change. The inequalities already in place before stand to be exacerbated.

I wish us all a very fruitful and enlightening conference. Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/31-8-december-2020.html"
"2020-12-07","Your Excellency, Zhang Jianhua, Administrator of the National Energy Administration (NEA) of the People’s Republic of China,

Your Excellency, Wang Qun, Permanent Representative and Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary of the Permanent Mission of the People’s Republic of China to the UN and other International Organizations in Vienna.

Distinguished colleagues of the NEA,

Ladies and gentlemen, friends,

Good afternoon Beijing! Good morning Vienna!

I would like to thank Your Excellency for the kind words. To our colleagues at the NEA who have organised this meeting, I would like to express our gratitude to you. It is not easy to organize a meeting with a seven-hour time difference, so we appreciate your efforts!

I am delighted that we are joined by Ambassador Qun who is a familiar friend at the OPEC Secretariat. We remain so grateful for his briefing at an extraordinary meeting of the Joint Technical Committee held on 4 February this year.

In the current circumstances, we are unable to meet in Beijing. This is a real pity because my mission to Beijing in December 2017 has been one of the highlights of my tenure as Secretary General. Few places on earth come close to the extraordinary historical panorama that your capital city has to offer.

Once the pandemic is behind us, perhaps we will have the opportunity to meet in Beijing again. If we are fortunate, it might even coincide with the Winter Olympics in 2022! This is historic, as Beijing will become the first every city to have hosted both the summer and the winter Olympics!

Excellency,

The year 2020 marks the fifteenth Anniversary of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue, the first High Level Meeting of which took place on 22 December 2005 in Beijing.

Since then, cooperation between OPEC and China has intensified across a range of fronts, particularly on the technical level. Indeed, we last interacted at our milestone webinar on 14 May 2020, when I had the great pleasure of speaking with Your Excellencies.

We convene this meeting at an extraordinary time for the global community. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc across the world: more than 67 million people sickened; more than 1.5 million have perished; massive economic disruption; millions unemployed; businesses threatened; schools closed; health systems under intolerable strain…the list goes on, as sadly does the heartache and loss. No country has been spared.

This global crisis requires a global response. Multilateralism, international dialogue and cooperation among nations have become more essential than ever. These are the principles that underpin the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue.

In this time of crisis, we must turn to the leading international statesmen to reassure us with clear and concrete plans about how we will overcome these trying times. For this reason, I was truly inspired by the words of wisdom of Chinese President, HE Xi Jinping, especially at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit on 21 November.

In a concise manner, President Xi was able to synthesise the required international response into eight points in that speech, which was entitled, ‘Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future.’

In my remarks, I would like to outline how these eight points align with our own activities and objectives at OPEC.

Firstly, President Xi spoke of the need to ‘build a global firewall against COVID-19.’ He said,

“Several G20 members have made progress in vaccine R&D and production. We should speed up action and support the WHO in mobilizing and consolidating resources and distributing vaccines fairly and efficiently.”

At OPEC, we recognise the important role the oil industry will play in ensuring the speedy distribution of vaccines, particularly through the transportation sector. Additionally many of the medical supplies, surgical masks and respirators, as well as other equipment essential in the fight against COVID-19 come from petroleum-based products.

In such circumstances, volatility in the oil market is simply unthinkable, and consistently, OPEC and our partners in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ (DoC) have taken action to contribute to sustainable oil market stability.

This also relates to President Xi’s second point, ‘ensuring the smooth functioning of the global economy.’ As the President stated, “While containing the virus, we need to restore the secure and smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains.”

Again, the oil industry plays a vital role in lubricating the global economy, allowing the smooth functioning of the supply chain and acting as the engine for sustainable industrialization.

These two points were at the forefront of the minds of the DoC partners when the COVID-19 pandemic and its resultant impacts severely imperilled our industry. The month of April 2020 was ghastly. Large-scale oil demand destruction, at a level never seen before; a massive supply and demand imbalance; and, global storage capacity filling quickly.

Perhaps the nadir of this was April 20, or what some have called ‘Black Monday’, when the WTI May contract went negative, ending the day at close to minus $40/b.

To help counter the situation, OPEC and our DoC partners agreed at two Extraordinary Meetings on April 9 and 12 to new voluntary production adjustments, beginning with 9.7 mb/d, in May and June 2020, which was extended to July. Moreover, the tailored adjustments would also run two years until April 2022.

These are the largest and longest in the history of OPEC and the oil industry.

They were subsequently ‘tweaked’ at the 11th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 6 June, indicative of our flexibility and adaptability. We also agreed to a compensation mechanism for Participating Countries for underperformed volumes.

Just last Thursday, December 3, 2020, at the 12th OPEC and Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, Participating Countries unanimously agreed to a further tweak of the DoC voluntary production adjustments. In light of the current oil market fundamentals and outlook for 2021, we reconfirmed the existing commitment under the DoC decision from 12 April 2020, then amended in June and September 2020, to gradually return 2 mb/d, given consideration to market conditions. We decided to voluntary adjust production by 0.5 mb/d from 7.7 mb/d to 7.2 mb/d beginning in January 2021. We agreed to hold monthly OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meetings starting January 2021 to assess market conditions and decide on production adjustments for the following month, with further monthly adjustments being no more than 0.5 mb/d; and extended the compensation mechanism to the end of March 2021.

Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,

President Xi also emphasized the importance of ‘harnessing the role of the digital economy.’ He said,

“We could foster an enabling environment for the development of the digital economy, enhance data security cooperation.”

Enhancing data transparency has long been a priority for OPEC. We are actively involved as members of the Joint Organisations Data Initiative; we regularly meet with Secondary Source institutions and other reporting agencies in order to improve the accuracy and timeliness of data sharing. The OPEC Secretariat is also developing its own Big Data platform, which contains easily accessible oil and gas data from multiple sources for the use of OPEC Member Countries’ representatives.

President Xi’s fourth point called on the G20 to pursue more inclusive development: “We should keep our support for developing countries and help them overcome the hardships caused by the pandemic.”

OPEC is unequivocal in its supports of the Sustainable Development Agenda, particularly SDG 7 which calls for access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. We must never forget that 1.1 billion live in energy poverty and 2.8 billion people have no access to modern cooking systems. These issues were discussed at the 75th Session of the UN General Assembly and the First Annual SDG Moment, which was held on 18 September 2020.

I would like to congratulate China on its efforts in combatting energy poverty.

We commend how China has recently outlined its plans to scale up its Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, as you outlined your opening remarks.

OPEC and its Member Countries remain fully committed to the Paris Agreement. We heartily agree with China that enhanced global collaboration is vital to address the challenge of climate change. Furthermore, international cooperation could allow a more coherent, balanced, integrated and inclusive approach for realizing the Paris Agreement goals and interlinked sustainable development aspirations.

For an intergovernmental organization like ours, President Xi’s fifth and sixth points resonate particularly strongly. He called on all nations to strengthen the UN system and improve the governance architecture for economic globalization:

“Global governance should be based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint cooperation and shared benefits.”

If ever proof was needed that relations between China and OPEC are based on shared values, a shared vision, it is these sagacious words. The President emphasised these points at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the UN, under the theme, ‘The future we want, the UN we need: reaffirming our collective commitment to multilateralism,’ held on 21 September 2020.

‘Extensive consultation’ and ‘joint cooperation’ is at the heart of everything our Organization does, from our cooperation with our non-OPEC partners under the ‘Declaration of Cooperation,’ to our energy dialogues with a range of partners, including your great country.

We know that no single actor possesses all of the answers or even knows all of the questions. It is only by reaching out and working together that we are able to confront in unison, the challenges of our times.

It is very much this spirit that has permeated the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue over the last fifteen years. This is also part of our broader recognition of the importance of China’s role over the coming decades.

In the immediate term, China’s ongoing economic recovery is one of the few brighter spots across the globe. According to OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), China’s economic growth is forecast at 2.0% for 2020 and 6.9% in 2021.

The more long-term perspective clearly underscores the immense importance of China to the global economy and energy industry. This was a recurrent theme in OPEC’s flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook 2020, which you made reference to in your opening remarks. The global economy is expected to more than double from 2019 to 2045. While China accounted for 19% of global GDP in 2019, this amount is projected to reach a whopping 24% by 2045!

World oil demand is to rise from 99.7 mb/d in 2019 to 109.1 mb/d in 2045. Accordingly, China’s demand for oil is set to rise from 13.1 mb/d in 2019 to 17.1 mb/d in 2045, or by 4 mb/d.

Your great country became the world’s biggest importer of crude oil in 2017, overtaking the US. In 2019, almost 70% of OPEC crude exports went to the Asia Pacific region. A large portion of these exports goes to China.

The percentage of oil in China’s fuel share in the energy mix is also expected to remain stable between 2019 and 2045, at 19% per cent. This means that although China has been making great leaps and bounds in the field of renewables, the need for oil will remain significant.

The oil market stability that OPEC tirelessly works towards is conducive to supporting the recommendations for formulating China’s 14th five-year plan, recently adopted at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee. It is critical also for the promotion of the sound development of the digital economy and the Belt and Road Initiative.

President Xi’s final point concerned the need to build up capacities for tackling global challenges. I truly believe that the OPEC-China energy dialogue is one crucial cog in that apparatus.

Excellency, Ladies and gentlemen,

The wise Chinese proverb tells us,

A single tree does not make a forest; a single string cannot make music.

Cooperation is what humanity needs in this dark hour. China and OPEC have repeatedly demonstrated their willingness to work together on energy matters. In this manner, we can make our contribution to fulfilling President Xi’s words, when he said,

“I believe that when COVID-19 is over, our world will rise from the pandemic and emerge even stronger. In that spirit, let us join hands to deliver a better life for our people and build a community with a shared future for mankind.”

Well said, Mr. President. May the wisdom of these words guide our discussions today and the OPEC-Chinese relationship going forward.

Xie-xie

Thank you for your kind attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/32-7-december-2020.html"
"2020-11-23","Good morning, and good afternoon.

It is an honour and pleasure to participate in today’s Crescent Ideas Forum discussion on the Energy Outlook. I thank Majid Jafar, the CEO of Crescent Petroleum, and his team for organising this very timely event.

It is always a privilege to exchange views and compare notes with my friend and colleague, Fatih Birol, from the International Energy Agency. I look forward to the day when we can again do so in person.

At OPEC, we are very fortunate to enjoy a strong bond of friendship and cooperation with the IEA, a bond that has grown stronger under Fatih Birol’s leadership. Our Organizations share a commitment to improving data timeliness, quality and transparency, and to strengthening producer and consumer dialogue in pertinent areas.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Before I speak about the market outlook, allow me to highlight some of the important outcomes of yesterday’s G20 Summit.

To begin, I would like to point to the significant contributions made by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through its capable leadership of the G20 throughout this tumultuous year, which culminated in last weekend’s successful Summit.

As part of yesterday’s G20 outcomes, the world’s leading economies underscored the pivotal importance of a stable and uninterrupted energy supply to the recovery process, and to achieve a secure and sustainable energy future.

The G20 endorsed the Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) platform with its 4Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle and remove), recognizing the key importance and objective of reducing emissions, taking into account system efficiency and national circumstances. The CCE is a voluntary, holistic, integrated, inclusive, practical and complementary approach to promote economic growth while enhancing environmental stewardship through managing emissions in all sectors, including – but not limited to – energy, industry, mobility and food.

We call on all parties to the UNFCCC to also endorse this game-changing toolbox.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We began this year on an optimistic note, optimistic about the global economy and healthy oil market growth. But our 2020 vision did not foresee the devastating impact of the coronavirus, the deadly toll it has taken across the world, nor the blow it has dealt to many economic sectors, especially crude oil.

We are heartened by the promising vaccine developments, and the hope that they can quickly be brought to market to save lives, first and foremost, but also to help reboot the global economy.

Nonetheless, the oil market today is overshadowed by the resurgence of COVID-19 and a slower pace of economic recovery than we had envisioned in the second half of the year.

In this respect, our OPEC outlook for 2020 oil demand is now slightly above 90 million b/d. This represents a sharp decline of nearly 10 million b/d from where we started the year, and almost an 11 million b/d contraction compared to what we forecast for the year back in January.

In 2021, we expect growth to bounce back to 6.2 million b/d, to just over 96 million b/d, compared to our pre-coronavirus expectations for demand reaching almost 102 million b/d next year.

The recent revisions are due to the easing pace of the economic recovery and recent COVID-19 containment measures, which are assumed to impact transportation and industrial fuel demand well into next year.

The crucial market rebalancing efforts are further complicated by high stock levels. Preliminary data for October shows that total OECD commercial oil stocks were 208 million barrels above the latest five-year average, compared to 13 million barrels below the five-year average in January of this year.

Total global inventories have surged by more than 1 billion barrels since the beginning of this year. These figures would have been dramatically higher – and clearly unsustainable – had it not been for the unprecedented cooperative efforts taken to address the imbalance in fundamentals and stabilize the market.

In April, we delivered an unprecedented response to an unparalleled market shock, by adjusting output down by 9.7 million b/d, or roughly 10% global demand at the time. These efforts were spearheaded by leaders of major world oil producers and further supported by the G20, in the spirit of solidarity, at the group’s Extraordinary Energy Ministerial Meeting on April 10th. Both Fatih and I participated in this meeting.

The DoC’s unprecedented response has already gained notice in the annals of our time. One of the world’s leading energy writers, Daniel Yergin, encapsulates the significance of the DoC in his newest book, The New Map. He describes the actions undertaken by the DoC in this way:

“The deal itself was historic, both for the number of participants and the sheer complexity ... Nothing like this had ever happened before in the world of oil.""

In June, the DoC re-affirmed the importance of these contributions to overall market stability and full participation in the agreed adjustments.

In addition, the participating countries agreed to a fair and effective compensation mechanism for those who were unable to achieve 100% conformity in the first months of the agreement. These provisions stand out as a remarkable acknowledgement of both the commitment by these countries to support the market, and the scale of the challenge.

There is no doubt in my mind that these decisive and proactive efforts helped put the oil market back on stable footing. In doing so, the DoC provided much-needed support to the global economy as it began to pick up steam in the third quarter of this year.

Since May, the production adjustments undertaken by the participating countries have helped reduce the global supply by around 1.6 billion barrels, a truly impressive feat given the economic uncertainty overshadowing the industry.

I would like to stress that these efforts were undertaken not just for the good of the DoC participating countries, but in the wider interests of consumers, investors and the global economy in general. There can be no recovery without market stability, and no one stands to benefit from volatility.

Looking further into the future, I would like to draw on the analysis and insights provided by OPEC’s 2020 World Oil Outlook – or what we call the ‘WOO’.

Published last month, our flagship annual publication provides additional context on both the short-term implications of COVID-19, as well as market prospects through 2045.

Let me say here that our WOO and the IEA’s World Energy Outlook, the latest edition of which was also published in October, supply different perspectives on energy. But we are on the same page when it comes to our commitment to providing a better understanding of the current market, and prospects for the future.

The outlook for crude oil may look anaemic now, but we anticipate a gradual normalization of demand growth as the world recovers from the COVID-19 shock. Our analysts foresee global oil demand returning to relatively robust annual growth and reaching nearly 104 million b/d by 2025.

In the longer term, there are a number of factors that will drive consumption, such as population and economic growth, especially in developing and emerging economies. We expect the global economy to more than double from 2019 to 2045, to $258 trillion, and the population to grow by at least 20%, to 9.5 billion.

Simply put, our world will continue to thirst for energy. The WOO anticipates that oil will remain the dominant fuel in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future, accounting for a nearly 28% share in 2045, followed by gas at around 25%.

It is important to point out that it is the mainstream consensus of the leading reporting agencies is that oil and gas will retain their prominence in the energy mix for the foreseeable future.

In absolute terms, we see oil demand rising by almost 10 million b/d from 2019’s levels to around 109 million b/d in 2040, and then begin to plateau. The non-OECD will be the growth powerhouse, accounting for around 68% of overall oil demand by 2045, with the economic tigers of India and China leading this growth.

In absolute terms, we expect oil demand in the developing and emerging economies rising by 22.5 million b/d to around 74 million b/d in 2045.

Last week, the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations members joined with China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand in signing a trailblazing trade pact. The participating countries account for a significant 30% of global GDP, and around 28% of the world’s population. In terms of size, this new free trade zone surpasses those of the European Union and North America.

The pan-Asian agreement is a beacon of hope for the recovery and longer-term growth, and a model of regional cooperation and the critical importance of multilateralism.

I would next like to highlight a few points about sectoral demand. Our outlook shows that petrochemicals and transportation will underpin crude oil demand going forward. Electricity generation is the only area expected to see a decline as oil gives way to renewables and natural gas.

Road transportation will be the real driver of oil needs, just as it is today, and will account for 43% of total demand by 2045. We again see the growth shift to emerging and developing economies as the use of alternative powertrains rises in the OECD countries.

Aviation fuel consumption nosedived this year, falling by almost 50%, but we expect it to recover and be a primary driver of oil demand going forward, growing by 2.8 million b/d by 2045.

On the supply side, non-OPEC liquids are likely to recover from pandemic-related shut-ins over the medium term. Further down the road, however, non-OPEC liquids are expected to decline from a peak of nearly 72 million b/d by the end of this decade to around 65 million b/d in 2045, similar to levels in 2019.

OPEC liquids will increase from nearly 34 million b/d in 2019 to 44 million b/d in 2045. By the end of our outlook period, OPEC Member Countries will account for 40% of global liquids supply, up from 34% last year.

Turning to the downstream, we anticipate a wave of refinery closures as new capacity comes online in the Middle East and Africa, as well as the Asia-Pacific, with crude distillation capacity expected to increase by 15.6 million b/d until 2045.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We cannot have a meaningful conversation about the energy future without addressing the pressing global challenges of climate change and energy poverty, two of the action areas addressed at the G20 Summit this past weekend.

Let me be very clear that OPEC and its Member Countries are fully supportive of the Paris Agreement. All 13 countries signed the Paris Agreement and nearly all have ratified it.

We also back an energy transition that draws on the strengths of all energy forms, including oil and gas, which are and will remain the workhorses of our global energy system.

Many of our Member Countries are blessed with virtually limitless solar potential, and they are already hard at work diversifying their domestic energy mix.

A good example is the United Arab Emirates, the home base of our hosts today, which is tapping its solar potential and expanding the use of carbon capture, utilization and storage to harness the full potential of its diverse natural resources.

Another example is Saudi Arabia, which has successfully used the G20 platform to promote the Circular Carbon Economy to improve overall environmental performance.

We must not forget that there can be no fair and responsible transition without addressing energy poverty. The coronavirus pandemic has been a rude awakening for rich and poor, but this and other public health threats add a new layer of vulnerability for the 800 million people in the world who lack access to electricity.

We cannot take a leap forward without first taking steps to significantly expand energy access.

Nor can the oil industry move forward without the adequate capital to sustain its historic leadership in innovation and production efficiency. We will need financial firepower to grow out of the coronavirus-induced crisis, to sustain technological development and human resources, and to help provide a stable, economic and secure energy supply for the future.

For OPEC and its Member Countries, stable and timely investment is essential if we are to successfully achieve our cherished goals of economic diversification and development, and importantly, to help diverse our own energy mix.

In fact, OPEC’s World Oil Outlook shows that upstream capital expenditure could fall by more than 30% in 2020, exceeding the annual dramatic declines seen in the industry downturn of 2015 and 2016. Looking ahead, our projections for the oil industry show that investment of around $12.6 trillion will be needed in the upstream, midstream and downstream between now and 2045.

To get there, it is very important that the policy discussions on energy and investment remain inclusive and supportive of a diverse portfolio of energy options.

Despite the challenges that exist today, we at OPEC are as committed as ever to investments that that strengthen the oil industry’s resilience and capacity to meet the world’s demand needs over the long term.

Only yesterday, the UAE announced visionary plans to invest around $122 billion in its oil industry over the next five years. This is a powerful example of how a leading oil-producing nation is looking at the road ahead, fully focused on its continued leadership in exploration, technological advancement and environmental innovation.

In closing, I would like to share with you a brief video we prepared to help recap some of the findings of the WOO.

Before doing so, allow me to again thank Majid Jafar and the Crescent Ideas Forum for organizing this discussion about the energy outlook at such our critical juncture in the industry’s history, and indeed for all humankind.

I look forward to your questions, and to hearing from Fatih Birol.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/33-23-november-2020.html"
"2020-11-17","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to begin by offering our congratulations to Alexander Novak on his promotion to the position of Deputy Prime Minister. It is a thoroughly deserved recognition of his talents, hard work and diplomatic skills that we have all seen over the last 4-5 years.

We are also extremely happy to see Mr Novak retain the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) portfolio, and continue to be the reliable, dependable and judicious bridge linking OPEC and non-OPEC.

Since we last met on 19 October, the Secretariat’s home, Austria, has entered its second lockdown, along with many other countries across Europe.

The COVID-19 pandemic shows no sign of abating, ripping through regions, countries and populations as we head into the northern hemisphere winter. Although the announcement of various COVID-19 vaccines with over 90% efficacy rates, including Russia’s Sputnik coronavirus vaccine, has given a shot in the arm to the economic and oil demand outlook, offering some hope going forward.

Governments have also continued to expand fiscal stimulus measures, with many countries in Europe seeing a further monetary expansion to help their populations as they entered further lockdowns. Globally, these measures now total more than $20 trillion, including guarantees, equivalent to 20% of global GDP.

It is also important to recognize the leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through its G20 Presidency in 2020. The country has been extremely active and supportive of developing countries as they look to navigate a path through the pandemic.

For the oil market, the past month has offered both positives and negatives. Given the impending 180th Meeting of the OPEC Conference on 30 November, and the 12th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 1 December, it is vital that we appraise all the data and analysis, look at how details and numbers have changed since the start of the year and review what has been achieved by the DoC to date.

The global economic growth forecast remains at a negative -4.3% in 2020, which stands in stark contrast to the positive 3.1% envisaged at the start of the year, a staggering drop of 7.4%.

For 2021, we have slightly revised down growth to 4.4%, from the 4.5% we envisaged last month.

It remains a mixed economic picture. China is a bright spot, with positive growth of 2% in 2020 and other countries in Asia are also exhibiting some positive signs. However, new lockdowns, second and third waves of COVID-19 and high levels of unemployment, remain major concerns globally.

Evidently, the large fiscal stimulus packages remain supportive, and vaccines offer hope, but the benefits of the latter will take time to trickle through to the real economy, and oil demand growth.

The 2020 outlook for oil demand has been revised lower this month to a negative -9.8 million barrels a day (mb/d), a drop of 0.3 mb/d from our October meeting. This stands against growth of 1.2 mb/d that was expected in January 2020, a drop of a staggering 11 mb/d.

Additionally, this month we have revised down expected growth for 2021 to 6.2 mb/d, compared to 6.5 mb/d previously.

The recent revisions are due to the slow pace of the economic recovery and recent COVID-19 containment measures, which are assumed to impact transportation and industrial fuel demand well into 2021.

On the supply side, non-OPEC liquids production is forecast to contract by 2.4 mb/d in 2020, compared to expected growth of 2.4 mb/d that was forecast at the start of the year. For 2021, non-OPEC liquids is anticipated to expand by 0.93 mb/d.

It has also been interesting to note that the US oil rig count has climbed significantly over the past month or so, rising from 189 in the week of October 2, to 236 in the week of November 13.

Crude futures in all major benchmarks remain in contango, and in terms of inventories, it is clear that destocking has continued over the past month following the third quarter trend. In the third quarter of this year, global inventories declined across all components by around 250 million barrels (mb).

It is estimated that OECD commercial inventories fell by 44 mb over this period, non-OECD inventories declined by around 55 mb, and oil at sea, including floating storage, dropped by about 150 mb.

However, the destocking process is taking time, which calls for patience and due diligence. Preliminary data for October shows that total OECD commercial oil stocks were 260 mb higher y-o-y and 208 mb above the latest five-year average, compared to 13 mb below the five-year average in January 2020.

We need to remind ourselves that total global inventories have surged by more than 1 billion barrels since the beginning of this year, and this would have been much higher without the DoC production adjustments and the high levels of conformity.

We were heading to maximum tank tops if it was not for the historic decisions taken by the DoC.

The overhang remains massive, in both the OECD and non-OECD, and the situation requires vigilance and continuous monitoring, particularly given the large uncertainties going forward.

It underscores that even though we have seen excellent levels of conformity of over 100% and a robust compensation mechanism, the rebalancing process to reach normalized stock levels will spill into next year.

The DoC has achieved some hard win successes in tackling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global oil market. With the advent of second and in some cases third waves, we cannot be complacent.

We need to fully understand what is required, and be ready to adapt to any changing market dynamics to ensure we stay on the path that helps restore balance, and a sustainable stability to support growth and investments in the months and years ahead.

We need the courage and flexibility we have all shown this year to take the decisions required ahead, one step at a time, guided by the data and robust analysis.

Before I conclude, since this may be the last meeting of the JMMC before the 4th anniversary of the DoC I feel it is appropriate to applaud the exemplary leadership of the co-Chairs, HRH Prince Abdul Aziz bin Salman and Alexander Novak, who have led from the front during this most extraordinary year in the history of oil.

And thank all members of the committee and participants in the DoC for their sustained commitment in helping not only turn a new page, but write a glorious new chapter that will shape the global energy transition in the years and decades to come.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/34-17-november-2020.html"
"2020-11-17","Your Royal Highness,

Excellencies,

Ladies and gentlemen,

It my pleasure to join Their Excellencies in welcoming you to this 24th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee Meeting.

First, I wish to thank HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia for his ongoing efforts and leadership in steering this important Committee through a critical period of the oil history.

Sincere thanks also go to the Co-Chair of the JMMC, HE Alexander Novak. Excellency, on behalf of the OPEC Member Countries and my delegation of Algeria, we congratulate you on your new appointment as Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, and we wish you the very best in this prominent role.

I would also like to thank each Member of the JTC and the Secrertary General, HE Mohammed Sanuci Barkindo, for their valuable support.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In 2020, this has been no easy task, but OPEC has continued to rise to the challenge and, in close partnership with our non- OPEC partners of the Declaration of Cooperation, we have been able to provide a vital undercurrent of stability at a time of unprecedented uncertainty and economic distress brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Algeria had the honour of chairing the 22nd GECF Ministerial Meeting last week, and it was a pleasure to see many of you in attendance. We had a valuable opportunity to discuss the COVID- 19 impacts on the global commodity markets and the economy, as well as the related uncertainties that continue to plague the market. In the course of these deliberations, there were many positive remarks made by the Ministers regarding the courageous and responsible efforts of OPEC+ to bring balance and stability back to the energy markets.

It has been said many times and is worth repeating that without the valiant action of the DoC producers, the oil market and the economy would today be in dire straits.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Since we last met, several national lockdowns have been re- imposed by governments who are seeking to counter the swiftly rising case-loads of the pandemic as second waves of the virus spread across various regions. With more than 51 million confirmed cases worldwide, and around 1.3 million fatalities, the world is still at war with this silent nemesis.

This is above-all a humanitarian crisis, and governments around the world will continue to do whatever they can to help save lives and bring this urgent situation under control.

We were pleased to see the recent positive news on the COVID-19 vaccine front, as companies get closer to developing a proven safe and reliable vaccine. These positive steps forward have bolstered the stock markets and helped brighten investor sentiment, restoring hope that we will soon have a viable defines against this pandemic.

In the meantime, the global economy continues to suffer through a recession, with global GDP expected to shrink by 4.3 % this year. However, we expect the economy to gradually recover in 2021, reaching 4.4% growth.

As far as demand goes, we see contracting global oil demand for 2020 face further pressure from second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns. Such contraction, as high as 9.75 mb/d, is unprecdedented. However, in 2021, demand growth is anticipated to recover and expand at a pace of 6.25 mb/d. Nevertheless, global oil demand will remain well below pre-pandemic levels.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

What does all this mean? Simply that the road to recovery is still long and bumpy.

With that in mind, I would like to simply urge all Participating Countries, in these challenging times, to stay the course and remain committed to fulfilling our respective commitments. We must remain flexible and resilient — ready to adapt to the ever- changing dynamics of the market.

In this historic year in which we are proudly celebrating OPEC’s 60th Anniversary, let us strive to write the next chapter in our history. It is my sincere hope that this new chapter would describe how OPEC joined forces with non-OPEC producers to overcome a global pandemic, ushering in a heathy, growing and prosperous global oil market once again.

Thank you, and I wish us all a productive meeting today.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/35-17-november-2020.html"
"2020-11-12","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is an honour to take part in this 22nd Ministerial Meeting of the GECF, which is being graciously hosted by the Algerian Government, under the capable leadership of His Excellency, Abdelmadjid Attar, Minister of Energy of Algeria and 2020 OPEC President.

Excellency, I commend you for the dual leadership roles you currently hold in two of the energy world’s leading organizations – OPEC and GECF. This is a testimony, not only to your personal attributes as an industry veteran, an astute leader and a diplomat, but also speaks to the prominence of Algeria as a leading provider of the world’s precious oil and gas resources. Algeria continues to play a crucial role in the Declaration of Cooperation’s ongoing efforts to rebalance the oil market, restore economic growth and re-establish investor confidence globally.

I would also like to recognize my good comrade and colleague at the GECF, Secretary General Yury Sentyurin. Excellency, I thank you for your ongoing support in our common efforts to deepen the ties between OPEC and the GECF within the framework of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue.

Just one week ago, we held our inaugural High-level Meeting, which was an overwhelming success and the result of heightened cooperation between our two organizations at both at the technical level and at the policy level.

What started as an informal discussion between myself and His Excellency Sentyurin in Moscow on the sidelines of Russian Energy Week in October 2019 has now developed into a full-fledged, robust dialogue between two very interlinked organizations.

The potential of this dialogue is unlimited, and even that much more essential now, as, together, we seek to unite with all of our industry stakeholders to combat the ongoing challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and its massive repercussions for the energy markets. We simply cannot do this alone. Thus, Excellency, we value this partnership greatly and look forward to collaborating closely with our partners at the GECF in the months and years to come.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It was an honour to take part in yesterday’s Ministerial Roundtable on Natural Gas along with many of our esteemed OPEC and non-OPEC Ministers. The session, which was moderated by Dr. Bassam Fattouh, Director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, was both informative and far-reaching as together we sought to assess the future development of natural gas within a highly challenging energy landscape. I especially appreciated our discussions related to natural gas’ future role – whether it will be considered a “transition fuel” or a “destination fuel”. Future developments in this regard will depend on many contributing factors, however, I think we can rest assured in the fact that both oil and gas will continue to play a prominent role in accounting for more than half of the global energy mix.

I would like to highlight another important area of collaboration we have initiated with the GECF.

This year’s OPEC World Oil Outlook 2020, for the first time, featured an expert contribution from the GECF on the subject of liquefied natural gas, entitled: ‘LNG prospects in the post-COVID-19 era’. This provided analytical insights into the very dynamic issue of LNG, adding value to this flagship publication. OPEC, in turn, looks forward to having the opportunity to contribute an oil-related feature to the GECF’s flagship publication, the Global Gas Outlook.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

We are very encouraged by this budding cooperation between OPEC and the GECF, and we believe the best is yet to come for this mutually beneficial partnership.

Allow me to leave you with the inspirational words of the great 13th century philosopher Jalaluddin Rumi who said:

“Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”

These wise words are an antidote to today’s world, which, at times, seeks division over unity and adversity over peace.

Finally, before closing, I would like to recognize the new Minister of Energy of Russia, His Excellency, Nikolai Shulginov. Excellency, on behalf of OPEC, I extend to you our best wishes in your new role. We look forward to working closely with you to deepen the OPEC-Russia partnership. Spasibo!

Excellencies, I look forward to fruitful deliberations today.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/36-12-november-2020.html"
"2020-11-05","Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I wish you Namaskaar! And in these strange times wish you all very good health!

It is a great honour to hold this fourth High-level Meeting of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue today. A very warm welcome to my cherished friend, His Excellency, the Honourable Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Steel. I am sorry we have not had the chance to meet in person for so long!

It is high time for another chapter of this meeting, especially in light of the circumstances that have struck the energy markets in 2020 in the wake of COVID-19. Your country’s great enthusiasm for and support of producer-consumer dialogue has greatly contributed to OPEC’s success in pursuing sustainable stability of the oil market in recent years.

Although it has been a challenging year so far, I want to quote your famous countryman Mahatma Ghandi when he said, “Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.” We have certainly been confronted with difficulty, but in light of these extraordinary times, I can also say we have kept moving forward and thus also achieved great success, not least in the realm of multilateral dialogue.

I want to add that India has continued to value the tradition of collaboration during the height of the COVID-19 crisis, as shown through a briefing with the management of Indian Oil on May 6 and a bilateral meeting with HE Pradhan on June 3.

India is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies and a major driver of global economic and oil demand growth. With India importing around 80% of its oil from OPEC Member Countries, and investment ties increasing with India, these talks are essential to all of us. They allow us at OPEC to have a deeper understanding of facts and figures regarding supply and demand, and our technical exchanges support both OPEC and India in their mandate of securing a stable energy future.

Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

I have had the good fortune to work closely with your good self through our OPEC-India Energy Dialogues, which began in 2015 and have become more appreciated with each passing year.

The last high-level OPEC-India dialogue was held in New Delhi in October of 2018, an event that was jointly chaired by your good self. It was the second time I was in your esteemed capital that year, the first being the 16th International Energy Forum Ministerial Meeting in April.

I recall with great clarity our discussions, at which we both agreed upon the importance of close interaction between OPEC and consuming countries such as India to address the common challenge of sustaining market stability to ensure a well-supplied market.

I will never forget my trip to India’s oldest operating refinery and one of the oldest in the world, Digboi Refinery that April. What a lasting impression it made! I got to experience a grand tradition and incredible example of India’s fine hospitality.

That same year, OPEC had the immense honour of hosting you, your excellency to the 7th OPEC Seminar in summer. At that time you talked about Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s four pillars for the country’s energy policy: energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security.

Your words were golden, as you underscored the reality that oil and gas are commodities of trade but also the “basics of necessity.” The impact of volatile prices on India was examined, as well as OPEC’s role in maintaining supply and demand equilibrium.

Finally, I truly appreciated your quote from Mahatma Gandhi, which intuitively reflected an idea recently adopted by the G20 meeting this September on the circular carbon economy: “Art is to provide enough to satisfy everybody’s need, but not everyman’s greed.” How apt.

I hope very much that you will again join us again to share your wisdom and enthusiasm at the upcoming 8th OPEC Seminar.

Your excellency, distinguished delegates,

Last week I had the honour of delivering remarks at the 4th India Energy Forum by CERAWeek in New Delhi. It reminded me that at the 3rd Forum just one year earlier the world was a different place. India’s GDP was at that time projected to grow by 6.1% in 2019 and 6.7% this year 2020. Stemming from the onset of COVID-19, which has dramatically affected economies around the globe, India’s GDP growth dropped in our latest Monthly Oil Market Report to
-7.5% y-o-y this year, though it is expected to rebound back to 6.8% y-o-y in 2021.

A downturn had already taken place in India in 2019 and the GDP at that time slowed to 4.9% — the lowest growth since the 2009 financial crisis. The pandemic has caught us all at a vulnerable time. Our fellow global citizens are suffering terribly, both from record high rates of the virus itself and its resulting economic devastation. We all pray that this terrible sickness that this terrible pandemic and the virus will pass quickly.

The events I have mentioned feel like they took place a millennium ago, due to the sharp and clear line that marks life before and after COVID-19. Back then, your excellency, we could still enjoy meeting in person and shaking each other’s hands! We hope that soon we will have the chance to meet again in person. The effects of the pandemic have been absolutely horrifying, not only at the human level, but also regarding the oil market and the global economy. It has resulted in the sharpest downturn in energy and oil demand in living memory. The scale and reach of the pandemic is to say the least unprecedented.

There is an Indian proverb that goes: “We cannot change the direction of the wind, but we can adjust the sails.”

This adeptly describes the actions of our Declaration of Cooperation partners over the past eight months, as they quickly and boldly moved to stabilize oil prices and rebalance the oil markets. The DOC participants collectively adjusted down production over a two-year period, starting with 9.7 mb/d — the deepest and the longest adjustment in history, and nearly five times more than historic adjustments made during the last downturn of 2014-16. This dramatic action has helped put markets on a path to rebalancing, though the road to recovery is most certainly still going to be long and wrought with difficulty.

I am happy to report that we see India's fuel demand rising in September for the first time since June, as easing COVID-19 restrictions support economic activity and travel, according to government data.

The US has seen stronger-than-expected economic indicators in the third quarter of this year, with 2020 growth revised up from last month’s –5.1% to –4.2% in the latest Montly Oil Market Report. We also see significant overall oil demand growth of +6.5 mb/d in 2021. Although we find ourselves in a difficult situation, we are optimistic that the future will be much brighter and that the world will see a way out of this pandemic next year.

Positively, your Excellency, our recently released World Oil Outlook also indicates that the medium-term future growth looks very, very upbeat for India. This is due to major structural reforms in 2017 and 2018, under your able leadership, along with government-led stimulus measures in combination with a recovery in the global economy. After the 2020 slowdown, the economy is forecast to expand by more than 6% for the rest of the medium-term period, accelerating slightly after 2022.

At the same time, you are setting a high bar on addressing climate change issues through your National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency, along with strong support for renewables through subsidies and tax incentives, as well as tightened fuel specifications. I was also very impressed at the 4th Indian Energy Forum, held on October 26, when Prime Minister Modi announced new targets for the energy mix of your esteemed country, with emphasis on natural gas.

At that event, Prime Minister Modi outlined a new energy map of India focusing on seven key drivers: Accelerating efforts to move towards a gas-based economy; cleaner use of fossil fuels; greater reliance on domestic sources to drive biofuels; achieving a renewables target of 450 GW by 2030; increasing the contribution of electricity to de-carbonize mobility; moving into emerging fuels like hydrogen; and digital innovation across all energy systems.

You said your excellency at that meeting: “The energy agenda in India is inclusive, market-based, and climate sensitive.”

I think the world will applaud that.

With all its efforts, India’s primary energy sources are more flexible and diversified than in many countries, thus strengthening energy security. The World Oil Outlook projects your transition to clean energy sources by 2045 will accelerate, with renewables accounting for about 6% of the energy mix by the end of the outlook period.

At the same, due to the rapidly growing need for energy in your ever-expanding country — it is expected to quadruple by 2045 — India is predicted to be the largest contributor to incremental oil demand over the longer term, adding some 6.3 mb/d between now and 2045. With this in mind, the strengthening connection between OPEC and India represents a key element in energy security. Indeed, given the future outlook, we will have much to discuss today. We hope, your excellency, that our relationship will continue to deepen, including addressing the role of OPEC as a partner in the energy transition.

We have always said that all sources of energy will be needed to meet growth in energy requirements in the coming decades. At the same time, the entire world is threatened by climate change. It is up to all energy producers and consumers to do their utmost to make all sources of energy cleaner and greener.

Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

This meeting follows on the heels of our 3rd Technical Meeting of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue held a few days ago on November 2. We will expand on some of the dialogues started on that day, including the impact of COVID-19 on oil markets and security of India’s energy supply.

We will also discuss the roles of the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC and the Charter of Cooperation in maintaining oil market stability on a sustainable basis.

As always, we are looking for ways to enhance future collaboration, including addressing the issues of energy poverty and energy security. Within the framework of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue we have already accomplished so much, including important endeavours in research activities and data sharing. Yet there is so much more we can do together! Your commitment to discourse massively aided in the success achieved in helping to restore stability to global oil markets in 2017-2019, and again since the unprecedented downturn this year due to COVID-19. I deeply appreciate, your Excellency our deepening relationship and your continued commitment to this joint endeavor.

We are very excited about our exchange today and look forward to a very productive day and wish you all the best.

Namaste.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/37-5-november-2020.html"
"2020-11-04","Your Excellency, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

It is an honour to welcome you to this 1st High-level Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue.

I want to recognize His Excellency, Yury Sentyurin, Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, without whom we would not be having this meeting here today.

Excellency, I remember the very engaging discussions that we had back in February of 2019 on the sidelines of the 9th IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We both agreed that closer cooperation between our two organizations was not only important, but would be mutually beneficial.

This meeting paved the way for the subsequent signing of a memorandum of understanding in October of 2019 during Russian Energy Week in Moscow. The MoU envisions a close partnership through the “exchange of knowledge, experience, views, information, data and practices in areas of mutual interest,” and sets the groundwork for further cooperation.

From the outset, OPEC and the GECF have much in common. We have some of the same Member Countries and share similar founding principles, values and priorities. And together, we supply a large part of the world’s energy needs.

Excellency, the seeds planted during our initial discussions in Riyadh and Moscow and the subsequent signing of the MoU have culminated in this event here today -- the inaugural edition of the High-level Energy Dialogue with the GECF.

In the lead-up to today’s meeting, both parties have held two technical meetings -- the first one in summer, on June 22nd and the second on the 19th of October. These meetings served as valuable forums for engaging discussions on issues of common concern and helped us establish a solid platform for future collaboration. They also provided us the opportunity to chart out the future path of the Dialogue, both at the technical and policy-levels.

On July 9, 2020, OPEC attended the 3rd GECF Annual Workshop on Promotion of Natural Gas Demand, which provided an in-depth look at the ever-evolving landscape of natural gas demand and prospects for demand growth going forward.

Another area of collaboration worth noting is GECF’s expert contribution to our 2020 World Oil Outlook on the subject of liquefied natural gas, entitled: ‘LNG prospects in the post-COVID-19 era’. This provided expert insights into the very dynamic issue of LNG, adding value to this flagship publication. In turn, we look forward to having the opportunity to contribute an oil-related feature to the GECF’s flagship publication, the Global Gas Outlook.

Thus, as you can see, in a very short timeframe, we have launched with great success this mutually beneficial partnership, and look forward to building upon these key milestones today.

Excellency, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

Today’s Meeting has two sessions. The first will feature presentations from both parties on the short, medium and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global energy markets.

In Session 2, OPEC will give a presentation on the Declaration of Cooperation, which is now in its fourth year, and on the longer-term Charter of Cooperation. Finally, we will have an opportunity to discuss the Dialogue’s work programme and the roadmap for the next year.

Before we continue, allow me to say a few words on the oil market outlook.

This year has been defined by the COVID-19 global pandemic, which, in addition to being a human tragedy, has wreaked havoc upon the energy markets.

We have witnessed record demand contraction, which, in 2020, is expected to be down by roughly 10%, to a level of around 90 mb/d.

The market hit an all-time low on April 20, 2020 in what has been termed “Black Monday”, one of the worst oil shocks in history. The industry faced a potential crude oversupply of nearly 1.3 billion barrels. There were even deep concerns that some storage hubs could actually reach tank tops. Since then, the situation has eased, although some countries are still dealing with high inventory levels.

In the wake of this monumental crisis, strong action needed to be taken urgently to avert any further destruction to the market. In a bold and proactive response, OPEC and the non-OPEC oil-producing countries in the Declaration of Cooperation undertook the largest and longest production adjustments in the oil industry’s history in April.

In this regard, allow me to recognize Her Excellency, Rocio Nahle, Energy Minister of Mexico, who is attending this meeting today, and thank her for Mexico’s support in ensuring these historical ministerial decisions were achieved unanimously.

This courageous response by the DoC countries helped rescue a market in turmoil, drawing down bloated inventories and helping improve investor confidence that had been stuck in a gloomy mire. This DoC’s sacrificial efforts helped put the oil market on track to rebalancing and helped promote economic recovery. These efforts continue to be lauded at the highest levels of government and from energy stakeholders in both the public and private sectors worldwide.

Although we have made great strides to bring balance back to the oil market, enormous uncertainties remain as second waves of COVID-19 sweep across many regions of the world, dimming our hopes for a rapid return to rising oil demand and economic growth. In 2021, however, we see oil demand growth recovering to a level of around 6.5 mb/d.

The longer-term horizon paints a more positive picture. We forecast global primary energy demand rising by a significant 25% in the period to 2045. This jump in demand will be fuelled by two main factors -- a massive doubling of GDP growth, combined with a jump in global population by roughly 1.7 billion people by 2045.

In terms of renewable energy, we expect it to grow faster than any other source of energy, at an average of around 6.6% annually, but oil and gas will continue to make up the lion’s share of the energy mix throughout the forecast period. Oil is forecast to supply nearly 28% of global needs, followed by gas at around 25%.

Let me be clear, though, for the umpteenth time, that the world will require all forms of energy to meet long-term energy demand while also contributing to addressing other pressing issues such as energy poverty. Both crude oil and gas will continue to be essential to meeting the dire needs of developing countries as they continue to develop and expand their economies.

Another pressing issue is that of investment. We expect that a massive $12 trillion will be required for investment in all sectors from now until 2045 to ensure this industry continues to expand and prosper. We will need all stakeholders on board to ensure that policies are implemented ensuring the security of longer-term investments. The industry’s future will depend on this.

Excellency, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

We look forward to exploring these issues in more detail today as we move through our agenda. I would again like to thank my comrade, His Excellency, Yury Sentyurin, for his leadership and firm support for this Dialogue. I also commend the GECF’s excellent contribution to this year’s WOO. We believe this is the beginning of a long and fruitful cooperation between OPEC and GECF.

Allow me to close now with the inspiring words of Japanese writer Ryunosuke Satoro who once said, and I quote:

""Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean"".

May this spirit of teamwork and solidarity pervade our deliberations today and in the future.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/38-4-november-2020.html"
"2020-11-03","Excellency, distinguished colleagues,

Good morning.

In welcoming you all this morning to the 7th High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue, it is with an extremely sombre tone that I begin proceedings, as we reflect upon the heinous attacks that took place in Vienna’s first district last night, very close to the OPEC Secretariat.

We offer our prayers to the victims of the attack, extend our heartfelt condolences to their families, and hope for a speedy recovery for all of those who were injured.

This was an attack bringing fear and hatred into the life of the people of Vienna and Austria. We strongly and vociferously condemn such senseless acts of extreme violence and terror solely aimed at taking human life and creating chaos.

We stand in solidarity with our host city, Vienna, which we have called home for 55 years, and the Austrian people.

Excellency, distinguished colleagues,

I very much wish that we could have held this meeting in person, delegation meeting delegation, person-to-person, but I think we all understand the restrictions we have in place to help contain the COVID-19 global pandemic.

Today’s meeting, the seventh edition to date, started in 2012, and my great friend, His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation has been present at every one of these meetings.

Over the years he has been instrumental in strengthening and adding depth to this the dialogue, which has seen collaboration on the G20 platform, the establishment of joint studies and workshops and the evolution of an internship programme.

And of course, this dialogue also provided the springboard to the historic Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) and Charter of Cooperation (CoC) that has evolved between OPEC and non-OPEC producers since 2016.

Your tireless efforts, your wise counsel, your strong support and your visionary contributions to this dialogue have helped ensure that we are always forward looking, proactive and focused. You have helped lead an unprecedented era of international energy cooperation between OPEC and the Russian Federation.

Our partnership has evolved into a permanent, transformative force-for-good in the energy market; one that has had a profoundly positive effect on the industry and the global economy.

I have on occasions been asked: what is the formula behind this flowering relationship? I think it is simple, and is summed up succinctly by the great Russian playwright, Anton Chekhov, who once wrote:

“You must trust and believe in people or life becomes impossible.”

We have evolved our relationship, shown mutual respect and developed great bonds of trust.

At OPEC, we have tremendous admiration for the Russian Federation; its status as one of the top oil and gas producers; the important leadership role it plays in international affairs; and the tremendous contribution that generations of Russian scientists, artists, writers, musicians and poets have made in shaping our civilization.

As we all know, the last four years of our work together has been historic. The DoC that was established on 10 December 2016 at the first OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting has been central to help tackle two major oil industry downturns, the latter coinciding with a pandemic and huge turmoil in the global economic landscape.

The three years that followed the signing of the DoC were characterized by disciplined implementation of the voluntary production adjustments; regular monitoring of the oil market conditions; and a gradual, albeit bumpy at times, rebalancing and stabilization in the oil market.

It proved a success, with benefits for both producers and consumers.

I should add here that the staunch support and the leadership at the very highest levels of government in the Russian Federation has been vital to the success of the Declaration of Cooperation. The President of the Russian Federation, His Excellency Vladimir Putin, has been a leading advocate of this endeavor from the very beginning.

This includes his positive intervention at the 22nd World Petroleum Congress in Istanbul in October 2016, in support of joint market stabilizing efforts, and I personally recall my bilateral meeting with him on the sidelines of the 2nd Russia Energy Week, in Moscow in October 2018, where he reiterated his support. President Putin’s continued pledges of support of all participating countries for their ongoing commitment and contributions to sustainable stability in the global oil market are vital.

The platform that was laid with the DoC in 2017-2019, has proven vital in 2020 when there was the need for swift, proactive and decisive action, given the lightening shocks that jolted the global economy and with oil demand dropping by more than 20 mb/d in April.

This came in the form of support from the very highest levels of government, including a personal intervention from President Putin to help deliver the historic April OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial decisions.

These saw new voluntary production adjustments: the largest and longest in the history of OPEC, the DoC and the oil industry. It was an unparalleled commitment to rebalancing and stabilizing the market, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

Despite the often choppy waters in the period since then, I feel we can say that the DoC production adjustments have helped the market right the ship and steer a course out of these waters.

However, it is evident that more work still needs to be done, which is why we continue to hold monthly JMMCs to monitor conformity to the adjustments and the state of the market.

Let me say here that the Russian Federation is an indispensable part of what the DoC is looking to achieve.

It is also important to stress this dialogue connects the short-, medium- and long-terms.

To put it simply: this dialogue, and the broader CoC, will be vital to both the Russian Federation and OPEC as we look to navigate the future energy transition.

It is our deeply held conviction that we need to work together, step-by-step, and challenge the misconception that the oil and gas industries are not part of our energy future, and that the future is one that will be dominated by renewables and electric vehicles.

The science does not tell us this; it tells us that we need to reduce emissions and use energy more efficiently. The stark statistics related to the blight of energy poverty do not tell us this either; they tell us that billions still need access to reliable and affordable energy.

The oil and gas industries are part of the solution; we possesses critical resources and expertise that can help unlock our carbon-free future.

Thus, it is vital that we discuss how we can use this dialogue to elicit responses and actions on the energy transition; promote solutions to the environmental challenge that can be found in technologies, such as Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) and others, that reduce and ultimately eliminate emissions; and further energize the CoC, with its broad footprint as a platform open to all producers.

I firmly believe that we can identify many areas to further our cooperation; this relationship can be pivotal to shaping our energy futures.

Your Excellency, colleagues,

In an ever more interdependent and global market, the challenges which this industry faces are inherently complex. No single stakeholder possesses all of the answers or, indeed, knows all of the questions.

It is why we hold this OPEC-Russia High-level Energy Dialogue, and the broader DoC and CoC, in such high esteem.

It is only through working together, with flexibility, commitment and pragmatism, that we can hope to surmount the obstacles we face.

This dialogue continues to go from strength-to-strength, and I very much look forward to the informative sessions we have today, and the further flourishing of our vital and innovative cooperation.

I look forward to the day when I can return to Moscow, St. Petersburg, or any of the other beautiful cities, places and landmarks that adorn the Russian Federation.

Thank you, and I would like to now hand the floor to my good friend, His Excellency Alexander Novak.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/39-3-november-2020.html"
"2020-10-27","Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon and welcome to this 14th High-level Meeting of the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue.

It seems hard to imagine during these times of a global health pandemic that our last meeting in November of 2018 was held in person at the EU headquarters in Brussels. What seemed normal then, seems unrealistic now.

I am sure you will agree that we all miss those days in which we could gather together face to face to discuss issues of mutual interest and concern, but we must move on and adapt to the ever-evolving realities that this pandemic has ushered in -- what many are terming the “new normal.”

Before I proceed, allow me to recognize Her Excellency, Kadri Simson, European Commissioner for Energy from the European Commission.

I had the pleasure of holding a bilateral meeting with Commissioner Simson via videoconference on 7 May 2020. Our discussions focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, which was wreaking havoc on the global economy and the oil market. We also discussed current and future plans for the ongoing EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue, which included the scheduling of this 14th High-level Meeting today.

Commissioner, allow me to commend the EU’s proactive efforts in confronting the human and economic consequences of this pandemic. Your close collaboration with the energy industry has helped ensure security of vital energy supplies to stakeholders across Europe.

I also laud the EU for the leadership role it continues to play in addressing climate change. OPEC continues to advocate for an all-inclusive solution to the twin challenges of energy access and climate change. There is simply no one energy source that can address the dual needs of energy poverty and future growth.

I am also very pleased to welcome representatives of other countries in the OPEC-non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation who are attending this meeting. This is a testament to the importance and high level of interest that our Member Countries and the DoC Members have in this and other energy dialogues OPEC holds with its global stakeholders.

Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

This energy dialogue with the EU dates back to 2005 and is the first energy dialogue that was established by OPEC to provide a platform for producer-consumer cooperation.

In the years since, OPEC has expanded its portfolio to include dialogues with China, India, Russia, and the US, as well as with international organizations and global corporations.

These events have proven to be highly effective in promoting mutual understanding on key energy issues, while also enhancing our common efforts to tackle energy challenges, such as the current pandemic.

Commissioner, I appreciate the supportive comments you made during our last meeting in regards to the ongoing efforts of OPEC and our non-OPEC partners of the Declaration of Cooperation to rebalance the oil market and renew investor confidence in the energy industry.

These cooperative efforts have provided a vital stabilizing force in the oil market, and more importantly, they saved this industry from a near collapse in the wake of “Black Monday” on April 20, one of the worst oil shocks in history. Without these sacrificial contributions of the DoC, the oil market would clearly be much worse off today.

The effectiveness of this global energy cooperation has been lauded at the highest levels of government and by the G20 Energy Ministers at their April and September Meetings. In addition, the industry has benefited from the contributions of other producing countries who have voluntarily or involuntarily shut-in production.

We have indeed come a long way in addressing this unprecedented global health crisis, but unfortunately, we are not yet out of the woods. There are still regional pockets around the world experiencing a resurgence in infections as winter approaches, and the spectre of renewed lockdowns is not out of the picture. These eventualities, if they materialize, would slow the process of economic recovery and the rate at which we see oil demand return to pre-pandemic levels.

Consequently, we must remain vigilant, and continue to seek a multilateral approach to addressing this pandemic.

It is clear that a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels of growth may take time and may only come to pass when ALL stakeholders do their part to help restore economic growth. This includes the potential financial stimulus measures that are being debated by various governments as a means to neutralize the economic fallout from this crisis.

We look forward to hearing from your Excellency and our EU colleagues about the progress being made in this regard, and to receiving an update on initiatives the EU is carrying out to achieve a post-COVID-19 recovery.

We will also have an opportunity to discuss short- and long-term term oil market perspectives, the current status of the energy transition in light of the pandemic, as well as issues related to energy policies, sustainability and energy security.

Many of these issues were discussed in detail at the 3rd Technical Meeting of the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue, which took place last Friday. OPEC presented the outcomes of our 2020 World Oil Outlook, which was released on 8 October, and the EU shared with us its new energy framework, including its “New Green Deal” policy. This meeting was very productive and served as a perfect tie-in to today’s deliberations.

Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

During times of crisis, such as this, dialogue and cooperation are even that much more essential, and that is why events such as this one here today must be prioritized.

Only by working together with our global partners will we be able to clear this formidable hurdle and proceed on to a more stable and predictable world in which the economy and the energy markets can flourish once again.

I would like to close with the wise words of UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, who is the world’s leading advocate for multilateral engagement.

“I am a multilateralist. I am deeply convinced that there is no other way to deal with global challenges than with global responses, and organised in a multilateral way.”

Shining examples of this multilateral approach are the Declaration of Cooperation, now in its fourth year, and the longer-term Charter of Cooperation, which have transformed the way this industry does business. Indeed, a new era in global energy cooperation has been ushered in.

This year, OPEC is celebrating the 60th Anniversary of its founding on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad. To mark OPEC’s momentous six-decades of achievement, we have put together a special documentary that I would like to share with you now.

With that, I would now like to turn the floor over to Her Excellency, Commissioner Kadri Simson who will provide some opening remarks for us.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/40-27-october-2020.html"
"2020-10-26","Your Excellency, the Honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi, global oil and gas leaders,

It is a tremendous honour and privilege to have this opportunity to address you today, at the India Energy Forum by CeraWeek.

OPEC truly values the positive relations that have evolved with India over the years, under the able and exemplary leadership of HE Prime Minister Modi, and support of HE Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Steel.

India’s enthusiasm and encouragement for the producer-consumer dialogue has contributed enormously to the success that has been achieved in helping to restore stability to global oil markets in 2017-2019, and then again given the unprecedented downturn in 2020.

India’s outreach, and its openness to explore ways to further enhance collaboration with OPEC, and to work together to address a variety of key energy issues, such as energy security and energy access, should be applauded.

This is not only through our excellent OPEC-India Energy Dialogue that began in 2015 and has become more valuable with each passing year, but also other fora. For example, through the G20 platform, with India’s support for the stabilizing market role of OPEC and the Declaration of Cooperation participants at G20 Energy Minister Meetings in 2020.

India has become a global economic powerhouse. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2020, we see India accounting for 16% of the global economy by 2045, double that of today. India’s oil demand is forecast to rise from 4.7 mb/d in 2019 to 10.7 mb/d by 2045, with its global share rising from 5.2% to 10.8% by 2045.

Prime Minister, India today imports around 80% of its oil from OPEC and this level is expected to stay relatively stable in the period to 2045, and our Member Countries are forging ever-closer investment ties with your great country

This fully underscores the importance of the two-way energy security relationship between India and OPEC.

OPEC also supports India’s visionary plans for the energy transition, and the role of oil and gas in this, as well as the huge success it has had in in expanding energy access to all corners of India. This is testament to the country’s socioeconomic progress and commitment to sustainable development.

Your Excellency, Prime Minister Modi, OPEC is a reliable partner of India and the great strategy you set out for your esteemed country. Long may this relationship continue to blossom.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/41-26-october-2020.html"
"2020-10-22","Distinguished experts – IEA, IEF and OPEC colleagues:

Good afternoon, or good morning to those joining us from the UK or from the other side of the Atlantic.

I would like to thank everyone for joining us via videoconference for the Seventh Joint IEA-IEF-OPEC Workshop on the Interactions between Physical and Financial Energy Markets.

It is a challenging time for us all; an unprecedented time for us all. The only way we are able to hold events like this is via videoconference, but I believe the last eight months has shown how adaptable we have become and how we have embraced this new way of working.

We continue to interact; we continue to do business; and as OPEC its partners in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) have shown this year, we continue to make decisions to help achieve balance and sustainable stability in the oil market.

We would like to thank our co-organizers, the IEA and the IEF, for their great efforts in making this event possible.

It a great pleasure to welcome to this event for the first time, the new Secretary General of the IEF, Joseph McMonigle, who officially assumed his position on 1 July 2020. Mr. McMonigle is well known to many of us with over 20 years of experience working on energy issues in the public and private sectors, and also previously a regular at OPEC Ministerial Meetings.

We wish you the very best in your role and we are sure you will have great success in strengthening and extending the producer-consumer dialogue, which has never been more important than during the dark days we have experienced in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

And I would also like to thank our colleague from the IEA, Keisuke Sadamori, Director of the Office for Energy Markets and Security, who is today heading the IEA’s delegation. Mr Sadamori took up his position in October 2012, have previously served in the Cabinet of the Prime Minister of Japan and in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan.

Today’s event represents one of three regular dialogues held under the IEA-IEF-OPEC joint work programme, which was established and endorsed by Energy Ministers ten years ago at the 12th International Energy Forum in Cancún, Mexico, in 2010. The other dialogues are the Symposium on Energy Outlooks and the Symposium on Gas and Coal Market Outlooks.

These events have attracted participation at the highest levels, as is apparent today, and they have also been commended at the highest levels, such as through the G20. In fact, many of the topics we will discuss today, were on the agenda and reflected in the communique from the most recent G20 Energy Ministerial Meeting, held at the end of September 2020 under the Presidency of OPEC Member, Saudi Arabia.

These efforts are also complemented by the excellent work that the IEF, the IEA and OPEC contribute to the JODI initiative, which has been essential to enhancing global energy data transparency.

These collective efforts underscore the tangible benefits that the strengthening of the producer-consumer dialogue has brought to the market, and we look forward to deepening and enriching our engagement with further close collaboration.

The importance of this dialogue has been brought home to all of us in 2020. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oil market have been unparalleled.

Large-scale oil demand destruction, at a level never witnessed before; global storage capacity shrinking fast; a massive supply and demand imbalance, that required the DoC to embark on bold and decisive production adjustments, the largest and longest in the history of the industry; and, production being shut in elsewhere.

Some have dubbed the month of April as ‘Black April’ and there is one specific date, April the 20th, that will be forever remembered for the collapse in NYMEX WTI. On this day, the price of WTI in the futures market plunged by $56/b to minus-$37.6/b, the first ever plunge into negative territory. In other words, sellers were paying buyers!

The drop came one day before the expiry of the front-month May WTI contract, amid low liquidity; a delivery problem for physical May crude at the Cushing hub with traders rushing to reserve storage capacity given expectations that tanks would reach maximum capacity in the coming weeks; and with some speculators still holding open contracts scrambling to exit long positions.

This all created a severe squeeze on the market. It has been described as ‘extraordinary’, ‘scary’ and ‘visceral’. WTI broke below $1, less than a 30 minutes before the settlement, but in those final 30 minutes it dropped another $38!

It was clear that actions taken by the DoC on April the 12th stopped short the race to zero dollar oil, and have been pivotal in reducing volatility and bringing back some semblance of stability to the market.

It dramatically underscored the relationship between physical and financial markets, and I am sure it will be much discussed today.

Today, we have three sessions in our programme, all focused on the impact of COVID-19, but each with a different slant.

Out first session is on the ‘Impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and commodity markets’. The focus is on providing a high-level overview of how the knock-on impacts of the pandemic has ripped through the global economy and commodity markets: Which countries and what industries have been impacted most? What has been the effect on global trade? And what are the prospects for recovery in the rest of 2020 and into 2021?

The second session considers the ‘Global oil industry investment patterns and dynamics in light of COVID-19 and the energy transition’. This is an extremely important topic given that the current crisis has evidently been a serious blow to investment. The market collapse has already pushed some petroleum companies over the edge and poses an existential threat to others, on top of the fact that we were already seeing a shift in interest towards oil by some institutional investors.

We now expect oil industry capital expenditure in non-OPEC countries to plummet by 23% y-o-y in 2020, to about half the $741 billion record set in 2014. This puts highly skilled jobs, innovation and advances in efficiency at risk at a time when the industry – and the global economy – need them the most. To put this in a longer term context, in our recently released World Oil Outlook 2020, it is noted that the global oil sector will need cumulative investment of $12.6 trillion in the upstream, midstream and downstream through to 2045.

Moreover, we need to better understand the potential dynamics of the energy transition, where and what investment is required and what each energy can provide, while balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment.

The final session will look at ‘ETFs and the futures markets: lessons from recent oil market volatility’. This will examine the latest developments in various regional crude exchanges; explore the increasing involvement of exchange-traded funds in setting the crude futures benchmarks; and highlight how these have recently contributed to rising price volatility and the recent significant disconnect between the futures and physical benchmarks seen during COVID-19, most dramatically on April the 20th this year.

Finally, a gentle reminder that today’s discussions will be held under the Chatham House rule. In terms of structure, each session will begin with a few introductory remarks from our excellent moderators and then presentations from our discussion leaders. The floor, or as we see today, the screen, will then be open to allow for an interactive discussion amongst all participants.

It has been an extremely challenging 2020, but allow me to leave you with some positivity and a line from the great British poet Alfred Lord Tennyson as we look to 2021.

“Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering ‘it will be happier’…”

I would now like to invite my distinguished friends and fellow organizers from the IEF and IEA to say a few words, starting with the Secretary General of the International Energy Forum, Joseph McMonigle.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/42-22-october-2020.html"
"2020-10-08","Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is my great pleasure to welcome participants from around the world to this launch of the 14th edition of the World Oil Outlook (WOO).

I would also like to welcome all those joining us from Austrian oil and gas company OMV and the Executive Academy of the Vienna University of Economics and Business.

We are very pleased that Dr Rainer Seele, CEO of OMV, and Professor Jonas Puck, Academic Director of the Executive Academy’s MBA in Energy Management programme, will provide remarks to help kick off this event.

Both these great Austrian institutions are very good friends and neighbours. The OPEC Secretariat and many of our Member Countries have enjoyed a close working relationship with OMV for many years. The Executive Academy very graciously sponsored the launch of one of our other signature publications, the 55th edition of the Annual Statistical Bulletin, on July 13th.

Today marks the first time we are releasing our flagship annual publication by videoconference. This is a reflection of how dramatically COVID-19 has changed our world.

The pandemic has ushered in one of the greatest economic and humanitarian challenges of modern times.

Lives have been upended. Livelihoods disrupted. Uncertainty abounds.

Today, more than one million lives have been lost to this silent and persistent enemy, a tragedy beyond comprehension in peacetime.

Years that test us, like this one, ultimately demonstrate our strength. This year, 2020, has been a defining one for OPEC.

OPEC was founded 60 years ago with the specific aim of securing an efficient and economic supply of oil to consuming nations, enabling steady investments in the petroleum industry, and in turn providing essential support to the global economy.

It is a mark of our success that the principles forged by OPEC’s Founders in Baghdad, Iraq, on September 14, 1960 remain relevant – and indeed vital – in the contemporary world.

The World Oil Outlook is a manifestation of these founding principles. Each edition provides a timely and essential reference for all energy stakeholders. Its continuity is a symbol of stability when we need it the most.

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Before we turn to some of the insights contained in this year’s World Oil Outlook, allow me to recap what has happened in the past 10 months.

2020 began on a very positive note. We projected global economic growth of around 3% in this year compared to 2.9% for 2019. We expected the improving economy to lift global oil demand to 101 mb/d, a rise of about 1 mb/d from 2019.

Then the world turned upside down.

When COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March, the economic impact was already being felt and the fallout was spreading across continents and economic sectors.

Never before has there been such an abrupt and precipitous decline in oil demand side-by-side with a consequent swelling of inventory levels.

The deep recession caused 20% of world oil demand to collapse in the second quarter of 2020, intensifying the market’s volatility. The oversupply could have added a further 1.3 billion barrels to global crude oil stocks, and hence exhaust the available crude oil storage in some parts of the world.

Bold and decisive action was needed to pull the industry back from the brink.

In response, OPEC and non-OPEC countries in the Declaration of Cooperation ushered in the largest stabilization effort in oil history in April 2020. It collectively adjusted down production over a two-year period, starting with 9.7 mb/d, more than 10% of the world’s supply.

The proactive steps taken by the Declaration of Cooperation have helped restore stability and confidence in the markets, and served to set global oil demand and supply on a path to rebalance.

These efforts were reinforced at the highest levels of government and through multilateral engagement, as illustrated by the strong support for the OPEC-led efforts at the G20 Extraordinary Energy Ministers Meeting in April 2020. Furthermore, other major producing countries did their part by shutting-in production.

Against this backdrop of extraordinary events, this year’s World Oil Outlook provides the OPEC Secretariat’s in-depth look at the unprecedented scale and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global energy and oil markets.

For the first time, this year’s publication extends the outlook to 2045. This provides an additional five-year window to examine developments in energy and oil demand, oil supply and refining, the global economy, policy and technology developments, demographic trends, environmental issues and sustainable development.

Furthermore, the World Oil Outlook offers an assessment of the medium- and long-term prospects, as well as analysis of various alternative scenarios and sensitivities.

I would like to stress that in this year of great uncertainty, there is no 2020 vision. The World Oil Outlook is not a book of predictions. Rather it provides a helpful and insightful reference tool, one that underscores OPEC’s commitment to knowledge-sharing and data transparency.

With this in mind, allow me to highlight a few key points before we turn to our more detailed programme.

Following the large drop in 2020, global primary energy demand is forecast to continue growing in long-term, increasing by a significant 25% in the period to 2045.

The key drivers of this demand are the expected doubling of GDP growth and the addition of around 1.7 billion people worldwide by 2045. Other demographic factors are also at play, such as urbanization and middle class expansion, particularly in developing countries.

On a regional level, we continue to see an evolutionary shift in demand from developed to developing regions.

Given the pace of demand growth, it remains very clear that all forms of energy will be needed to support the post-pandemic recovery and address long-term energy needs. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the energy future.

Renewable energy will continue to grow going forward, rising significantly faster than any other source of energy at an average of around 6.6% annually.

Natural gas will be the fastest-growing fossil fuel during the forecast period, driven in part by higher urbanization rates, industrial demand and its competiveness over coal in power generation.

OPEC and its Member Countries recognize the importance of renewables to broaden the energy mix and to address the global challenge of climate change. Fully supportive of the Paris Agreement, our Member Countries are embarking on their own ambitious plans to diversify their energy portfolios.

Nonetheless, the petroleum sector is and will remain the sturdy foundation for meeting global energy needs, an assessment that is widely shared by other leading agencies.

In fact, we expect oil to retain the largest share of the energy mix throughout the forecast period, providing nearly 28% of the global needs in 2045, followed by gas and coal.

Assuming that COVID-19 is largely contained in the coming year, oil demand should partly recover and increase by almost 10 mb/d, rising to around 109 mb/d in 2045.

In OECD countries, oil demand is expected to plateau around 47 mb/d by the middle of this decade. Then it starts a longer-term decline towards 35 mb/d by 2045.

In contrast to the OECD, non-OECD will drive the demand for oil. We expect demand in this region to rise by 22.5 mb/d to around 74 mb/d by 2045, with India and China leading this growth.

By sector, petrochemicals and transportation will continue to underpin oil demand going forward, while electricity generation is the only area expected to see a decline.

Road transportation is still in the driver’s seat, accounting for 43% of total demand by 2045. Again, non-OECD countries will fuel future needs in this sector.

Travel restrictions aimed at containing the pandemic have had a particularly dramatic impact on aviation, especially on international routes. We expect this sector to partially recover next year and grow at a significantly higher pace in the long-term.

Another key sector, petrochemicals, is projected to be the largest single contributor to incremental oil demand over the forecast period, growing by 3.7 mb/d.

As demand for transportation grows, we anticipate a continued steady rise in the number of electric vehicles on the road. In fact, the share of EVs could more than triple between 2030 and 2045, accounting for about 16% of the 2.6 billion vehicles expected on the road by the end of the forecast period.

Other alternative fuels will also play a larger role in road transportation. Despite this, sheer growth in the number of vehicles on the road means that oil demand in this sector is likely to stay stable through the forecast period.

It is worth noting that this year’s World Oil Outlook examines policies and evolutions in technology that will influence the transportation sector going forward, on land, sea and in the air.

Turning to oil supply, we expect non-OPEC liquids to recover from the pandemic-related shut-in in the medium term.

Looking further ahead, a few non-OPEC producers show meaningful supply growth after 2025, including Canada, Qatar, Kazakhstan and Guyana.

I would like to use this opportunity to welcome Guyana to the club of oil-producing countries.

Beyond these four countries, most other non-OPEC producers are likely to see output stagnate or decline. As result, non-OPEC supply declines from a peak of nearly 72 mb/d by the end of this decade to around 65 mb/d in 2045 – similar to levels in 2019.

OPEC liquids will increase from nearly 34 mb/d in 2019 to 44 mb/d in 2045. By the end of our outlook period, OPEC Member Countries will account for 40% of global liquids supply. That compares to around 34% last year.

Now let’s turn to the downstream.

Crude distillation capacity is expected to increase by 15.6 mb/d until 2045, with a significant slowdown in the rate of required additions. This year’s World Oil Outlook confirms the trend of refining capacity increasingly migrating to new demand centres in developing countries.

As a result, most additions will be located in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. At the same time, developed regions are likely to see only minor additions as demand in these countries declines.

The pandemic has been extremely disruptive to refining. A wave of refinery closures is anticipated, even as new capacity comes online in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa.

Traded volumes of oil are expected to grow only modestly in the long-term, in line with supply patterns. However, we foresee that the Middle East’s share of global crude and condensate trade will rise robustly in the longer term.

When it comes to investment, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a shrill wake-up-call for the industry. Upstream capital expenditure could fall by more than 30% in 2020, exceeding the annual dramatic declines seen in the severe industry downturn in 2015 and 2016.

Looking ahead to 2045, our projections show that investments of more than $12 trillion will be needed in the upstream, midstream and downstream in the period to 2045.

Given today’s urgent challenges, it is important to remember that a well-funded oil sector provides many tangible benefits to global economy. Beyond supplying an energy source that is indispensable to our way of life, the industry provides many well-paid, highly skilled and stable jobs. It supports quality scientific, engineering and technical education. The oil industry has been at the vanguard of innovation for more than a century, with spinoff benefits for a spectrum of other industries.

Furthermore, investment is vital to supporting our industry’s contributions to addressing climate change by fostering the development and deployment of ground-breaking technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage, and by promoting a circular carbon economy.

Taken together, investment and technology provide powerful resources to help alleviate energy poverty, which, along with climate change, represent global priorities that are closely linked to building a more sustainable and resilient future for all.

From the perspective of OPEC and its Member Countries, the foundation for investment, growth and economic diversification can only be sustained through balance and stability in the market. The issue of ensuring global investment in oil is a core focus of the Declaration of Cooperation.

Speaking to the General Assembly last month, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said:

""The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the world’s fragilities. We can only address them together. Today we have a surplus of multilateral challenges and a deficit of multilateral solutions.”

Reflecting on His Excellency’s words of wisdom, I believe that 2020 has been a watershed year for global energy cooperation – a year when universal challenges have been addressed through collaborative responses.

The actions taken by OPEC Member Countries, together with non-OPEC countries in the Declaration of Cooperation, have helped reduce volatility in the oil markets, provided stability, and laid the foundation for recovery.

We have not acted alone. Never in OPEC’s 60-year history have we seen such a high degree of cooperation at the highest levels of government and involving energy stakeholders in producer as well as consumer countries.

It is our sincere hope that the momentum towards expanded dialogue and cooperation will not fade with the passing of time.

We must also bear in mind that these efforts require time and patience. The recovery will always be slower than the shock. There is no better time than now to work together, to build a more secure, sustainable and resilient energy future.

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

In closing, we have a very exciting programme today, starting with a brief video highlighting the main findings of the World Oil Outlook.

We will then have the opportunity to hear brief remarks from Dr Rainer Seele and Professor Jonas Puck.

Following their comments, we will listen to the insights of our leading analysts, ably guided by Dr Ayed S. Al-Qahtani, Director of OPEC’s Research Division, and Dr Abderrezak Benyoucef, Head of the Energy Studies Department.

After the interventions of our experts, we will open the floor to questions from the many participants representing the industry, financial institutions, reporting agencies and journalists who are joining us today.

I look forward to a robust exchange. With this I turn over the microphone to our moderator.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/43-8-october-2020.html"
"2020-10-06","Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,

OPEC and I personally have been waiting a long time for this day to come! A dialogue between African countries and OPEC has been in the making and we are very much excited to be opening this first OPEC-AFREC Technical Meeting.

I am thrilled to see my home continent finally take its seat and bring its voice to the dialogue table. We are privileged to have Dr. Ibrahim, the Secretary General of APPO, as a guest of honor and a veteran of the oil industry who also spent many years at the OPEC Secretariat.

A recommendation was made back in February 2019 that a technical partnership between OPEC and AFREC could be beneficial. It was stated at that time that this would also support OPEC’s medium- and long-term goals regarding energy poverty eradication and the continued use of conventional oil.

Thus, this meeting is the starting point of what we hope will be constructive and regular dialogues with various African entities. Arrangements are ongoing for a similar technical meeting with the African Petroleum Producers Organization (APPO) and the 1st OPEC-Africa high-level meeting, all under the newly established OPEC-Africa Energy Dialogue. OPEC is ready to go forward in a structured way to further this initiative, thus we attach special importance to this inaugural meeting! Others will follow suit soon this year.

As more African oil producers join OPEC — Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the most recent members, complementing Algeria, Angola, Libya and Nigeria — we would like to focus even more on this continent. Africa has a world of potential regarding energy and sustainable development, which we hope to help unlock together.

I have personally visited many African countries before the COVID-19 pandemic and we hope that many more countries will join the OPEC family, bringing their strengths and potential. Africa's oil industry holds huge potential. The continent is home to five of the top 30 oil-producing countries in the world, accounting for nearly 8.0 mb/d in 2019, just below 10% of world output. At the end of 2019, Africa was estimated to have proven reserves of oil in the region of 126 billion bbl. On the production side, there is still vast potential to achieve more!

Ladies and gentlemen,

Africa continues to be the world’s most have-not continent in terms of energy security. Many, if not most, African countries face severe energy shortages and this has held back industrial development. This is despite the fact that the continent is blessed with tremendous conventional and renewable energy resources.

I know that your Organization was formed in order to deal with this issue, with the noble goal of harnessing energy resources and making them available to people on the African continent to enable development. An additional benefit would be the protection of Africa’s forests, as access to electricity would reduce deforestation for firewood. Since AFREC’s launch in 2008, you have achieved great things.

I want to quote Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, who stated at a World Economic Forum on Africa: “We have got to be so impatient with moving Africa forward relentlessly – we have no choice. In 2025, there is absolutely no reason why Africa should not be totally lit up with the power it needs to industrialise, because we must not forget, no economy ever develops unless you have the base load power to drive industries and to be competitive... let’s not forget for this continent to create the jobs it needs fast, we must have base load power. So I believe that in ten years… we absolutely must develop Africa with pride and have universal access to electricity.”

Along with meeting the continent’s own energy demands, which is vital to development and growth, we hope to see the continent diversify within the petroleum sector to stimulate the job market and help protect economies.

Ladies and gentlemen,

As we know at OPEC, data and analysis are the backbone of good decision-making. Your Organization is focused on these same matters. Your work in designing a continental energy base is invaluable in the fight against energy poverty on the African continent. It will enable your decision-makers to engage with one another and the international community on this issue armed with the latest facts and figures. This will, in turn, expedite developments and synergies, while preventing overlaps. Data is an important starting point and OPEC is ready to enhance cooperation in this area. As the premiere organization focusing on this issue, with 53 member states, your reach is broad and your voice strong.

We appreciate very much our initial dialogue in 2016 on data services as well as your letter sent in May 2019 requesting a technical partnership with the OPEC Secretariat to help you implement your five-pillar strategy.

OPEC has identified domains in which a partnership is applicable. These include:

In short, working together with AFREC fulfils many OPEC objectives, including promoting the use of oil; strengthening expertise and research capacities,; standardizing working methods and databases with organizations similar to OPEC; and securing and enhancing the collective interests of OPEC Member Countries in future global negotiations and multilateral agreements.

Your Organization will gain from this fruitful collaboration through access to OPEC’s knowledge base, expertise and trained analysts, who collectively possess an incredible wealth of experience about the energy transition, the oil industry and related topics. The exchange of information between our two organizations will be highly beneficial to us both.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We must also consider two great scourges facing mankind today that overshadow all of our discussions: climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the entire world community, as well as the oil industry. Development has ground to a halt and I daresay reversed in many countries, with African countries being no exception. In fact, they are being harder hit, because most do not have the resources to support faltering economies in the form of financial stimulus or government handouts.

We are still in the midst of the grip of this deadly infection, with rates skyrocketing in some of the world’s major economies, and a second wave strongly affecting Europe and threatening other countries. The resulting lockdowns to try and contain the pandemic have had a catastrophic knock-on effect on the global oil industry, with demand dropping by an unparalleled 30% in April. Our latest estimations for the year 2020 is that overall oil demand will contract by 9.5 mb/d to average 90.2 mb/d, an overall loss of about 10%.

I want to add that although the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development pledges to leave no one behind, ine­qualities exacerbated by the pandemic could become even more pronounced in the long-term, in particular for developing countries and vulnerable groups that feel the effects of the pandemic acutely.

The lack of access to energy may magnify the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. Health facilities in many developing countries are at a disadvantage because of insufficient energy or unscheduled outages, which could affect their ability to deliver services at this crucial time. Zero or limited access to electricity complicates social distancing efforts, as energy is required for people to stay in touch, receive information, and work online or study from home. Additionally, a lack of access to clean energy means people are more vulnerable to respiratory infections, such as COVID-19.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Our collaboration should also have the added benefit of supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular: ending poverty (SDG1), good health and well-being (SDG3), quality education (SDG4), affordable and clean energy (SDG7), decent work and economic growth (SDG8). Generally speaking, SDG7 on energy is a goal that broadly cross-cuts all of the other sustainable development goals, providing support for their actualization.

As the first-ever universal goal on energy, SDG7 seeks to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sus­tainable and modern energy for all. However, hundreds of millions of people around the world still lack access to electricity, and progress on access to clean cooking fuels and tech­nologies is very slow.

According to OPEC figures, global electrification has increased from 83% in 2010 to 90% by 2018, but 789 million people still do not have access to electricity. The world’s deficit is concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 47% of the population have no electricity. Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies increased from 56% in 2010 to 59% in 2016. Most recent estimates indicate that the level of access in 2018 was 63%, therefore, 2.8 billion people still have no access to modern cooking systems.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people without access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking has further increased as a result of fast population growth. About 85% of people in this region lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking in 2018.There is a high human cost to this — millions die from respiratory illnesses as a result of a lack of clean energy for cooking.

We want to add here that under the Paris Agreement, implementation of national energy policies is gaining urgency, with new targets set for 2030 and 2050. Thus, the pressure is on to approach energy creation and consumption in a measurable, organized way.

Eradicating energy poverty has many positive knock-on effects, such as improved health, job creation and the addressing of inequality and environmental matters. Furthermore, the provision of universal access to modern energy would have an insignificant impact on emissions.

Ladies and gentlemen,

During today’s first session, we will discuss the structure and mission of both of our organizations, followed by an exchange of information. OPEC will have a presentation on energy efficiency, while AFREC will discuss an energy policy programme.

In the second session, OPEC will make a presentation on energy data, while AFREC will detail its African Energy Information System and Database.

Finally, we will look at future activities and the way forward for our collaboration.

Our dialogues started a long time ago, but I see today’s meeting as a wonderful deepening point — this long-overdue formalization of our relationship will no doubt strengthen over time. The African continent is vast, and has remained largely unmapped in terms of energy resources and energy use. It is time to put this dynamic and growing continent on the energy map.

OPEC is committed to Africa and we highly value these dialogues, which will help fill in knowledge gaps around our promising region.

I wish all of us a very fruitful meeting. Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/44-6-october-2020.html"
"2020-10-01","Distinguished delegates, invited experts, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

We are very honoured to welcome you to this technical workshop with widely acclaimed agencies and institutions such as yours on forecasting world oil demand and non-OPEC supply. The timing of this workshop could not be better, as we all constantly try to improve our short-term understanding of market perspectives and to better navigate choppy waters— particularly in light of today’s prevailing compound uncertainties.

It is indeed part of an ongoing effort for transparency and to further strengthen the Secretariat’s comprehensive analysis and analytical depth in research. An earlier initiative with secondary sources was a part of that drive, with an inaugural meeting held on July 9, from which at least 13 bilateral meetings with DoC participating countries emerged. Today’s focus will be on short-term oil demand and non-OPEC supply forecasting.

At that first meeting in July, we invited secondary sources together in order to enrich mutual understanding and allow us to learn from one another. Improving industry standards was a core element of this, and our discussions centred on surveys of production, methodology and sources.

This meeting continues the series as an extension of this topic, with a focus on how forecasting agencies address uncertainties and factor in the changing dynamics of the time as the world continues to grapple with an invisible opponent, COVID-19, and its knock-on effects. We will especially emphasize market developments and prospects.

I appreciate very much the attendance of the esteemed experts joining us over these two days: Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects; Paola Rodriguez-Masiu from Rystad Energy; John van Schaik from Energy Intelligence; Anne-Louise Hittle from Wood Mackenzie and tomorrow Neil Atkinson from the IEA; Francis Osborne from Argus; Jim Burkhard from IHS Markit; Chris Midgley from Platts and Linda Giesecke from ESAI. They all embody the team spirit we are encouraging as we roll up our sleeves and continue to face these challenges together. Each of these well-established institutions is a trusted partner in closely cooperating with OPEC, and they are highly respected references for the global energy community. We encourage all the delegates to take advantage of their deep knowledge and experience and initiate debate on points that may require clarification and deeper understanding. In the end, the mutual goal of all those present is to improve transparency and predictability in an effort to enhance market stability.

Dear colleagues,

While cooperation has always been our middle name, its necessity has been brought home even more emphatically in recent months. The actions of our DoC partners in tackling the unprecedented issues stemming from COVID-19 lockdowns, which destroyed 30% of demand in one blow, have driven the reputation of our Organization to new heights.

The market, and indeed the world, has once again recognized us as a stable, reliable and dependable partner not only in the current crisis, but also within the broader energy dialogue.

These multilateral efforts of the DoC have been lauded widely by leaders across the world, including at the recent G20 Energy Ministerial Meeting on 27 and 28 September, which made reference to the great importance of energy security and market stability. Ministers attending the meeting recognized the spirit of solidarity that has been so effectively demonstrated throughout this year in the face of great uncertainty. The meeting, under the Chairmanship of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, also established the Energy Focus Group, which is tasked with monitoring response measures in coordination with international organizations, including OPEC, and reporting back to the Energy Ministers.

This support at the highest levels of government continues to help advance the efforts of OPEC and our non-OPEC partners of the DoC to restore stability in the global oil market. However, we are not yet out of the grip of COVID-19. As we hold this meeting, a ‘second wave’ is washing over many countries in Europe and other areas, with numbers rising even above those in the spring. Some major economies have never gotten out of the ‘first wave’, such as India and the US. It is a trial that continues to face the world community as a whole, challenging all institutions in every country. The rising infection figures continue to create a drag on oil demand and undermine the global economic recovery.

In addition, the adverse longer-term effects with unfolding structural changes are becoming more visible — translating into devastation for many oil producers. Bankruptcies among US oil and gas firms have strongly risen since the oil industry crashed in March and April this year. The situation is most certainly similar for oil producers around the world. Haynes and Boone, an oil patch bankruptcy monitor, reported that nearly 50 oil and gas companies in North America declared bankruptcy in 1H20.

Distinguished colleagues,

I want to heartily congratulate you, our DoC partners, for your incredible successes to date. In the face of an unknown adversary of monstrous proportions, you have stayed composed, working continuously and rigorously to help navigate our industry through the toughest times in history. We have proven our dedication through strict scrutiny and high conformity above 100%. This is even more impressive given the unparalleled size of the adjustments made by this group.

We remain cautiously optimistic about the oil market’s recovery, even as the world continues to battle COVID-19 resurgences and clusters. News reports state that the world is getting closer to finding a vaccine; when this day comes, the demand/supply scenario will significantly brighten. However, until that time, large uncertainties and risks will continue to destabilize the oil market and affect the pace of economic recovery.

Dear colleagues,

Throughout this critical time, the Secretariat has been continuing to provide technical support, especially through quality data, in-depth analysis and comprehensive reports, as well as through ongoing meetings and dialogues. Our recent engagement on issues of crude oil production, including this meeting on market analysis and forecasting, will continue, and the networks we are building now will serve us well going forward.

The sessions held today and tomorrow are meant to help us get a clear picture of the methodologies used by individual agencies in tackling the subjects of global oil supply and demand trends and forecasts, including differentiating between apparent and end-user demand. They will describe their models, the weight of their qualitative expert judgments, and share evidence of their forecast accuracy as well as inherent challenges.

I want thank our participants for taking the time to attend today and tomorrow’s sessions and look forward to active engagement and discussions. I am sure insight will be gained as to how each participant might improve transparency and integrity. Narrowing our differences will constitute a win-win for each of us, for OPEC and for the oil industry as a whole.

OPEC is celebrating its 60th anniversary this year, and throughout this span of six decades, relationships with various institutions have deepened, providing ongoing support and expertise over the decades.

One thing is certain, in the highly complex and challenging world of today, we must continue to strengthen our networks and seek to continuously build bridges to attain the success we all aspire to.
Working in silos will simply no longer get the job done.

Thus, as we undertake this meeting today, I am encouraged to see another step forward in this direction as we bring these parties together for the benefit of all stakeholders.

Distinguished colleagues,

We all acknowledge that forecasts are forecasts and can only go so far in completely and accurately assessing the future, but famous French mathematician and theoretical physicist Henri Poincaré once wrote, and I quote:

""It is far better to foresee even without certainty than not to foresee at all.""

So, let us proceed with today’s agenda knowing that our common efforts here today and tomorrow will be both worthwhile and productive.

I wish us all a highly informative and interactive meeting.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/45-1-2-october-2020.html"
"2020-09-27","Excellencies,

Despite the contraction in 2020, global primary energy demand is forecast to continue growing in the medium- and long-term, increasing by around 25% between 2019 and 2045. Within this forecast, there are important regional differences.

Energy demand in the OECD is expected to decline slightly over the period. As a result, the non-OECD is expected to be the driver behind energy demand growth, with India and China contributing a large share of this growth.

In terms of the energy mix, the share of other renewables – consisting mainly from wind, solar and geothermal energy – will increase the most. Natural gas will also increase its share, while the share of oil and coal will decline. Nevertheless, oil is expected to maintain its leading role in the global energy mix over the entire forecast period.

As this slide shows, all energy sources will be needed to achieve the massive challenge of meeting future demand and expanding energy access to eradicate energy poverty.

In terms of investment, the most recent assessment shows that cumulative oil-related investment requirements over the period to 2045 will be almost $13 trillion, including investments in the upstream, midstream and downstream.

In 2015 and 2016, investments fell by 26% and 24%, respectively, year-on-year. After recovering somewhat in the last two years, upstream investments are estimated to have fallen by 32% in 2020, in response to COVID-19 related disruptions. Such levels are not sustainable if supply is to be sufficient to meet expected future demand. Adequate and timely investments are essential not only to meet rising demand but also to replace lost production due to natural decline. Therefore, reduced upstream investment is one of the key downside risks to the outlook for global supply.

Excellencies,

The energy industry faces the dual challenge of meeting future energy demand and contributing to energy transitions. In this regard, the following four key areas will need to be targeted.

The first is to expand energy access. Current estimates by the UN show that, without additional effort, 620 million people will still be without access to electricity in 2030. Similarly, some 2.3 billion people would still be cooking with inefficient traditional sources, posing environmental, health and socio‐economic threats if efforts are not accelerated.

Secondly, investments will also be essential to improve energy efficiency across all sectors to ensure that the energy is produced and consumed with the lowest possible footprint in terms of greenhouse gases (GHG).

Thirdly, investments will be needed to support transitions to cleaner fuels. However, the focus should not be restricted to renewables. The extended use of natural gas, cleaner oil products and hydrogen provide viable options to meet the dual challenge of growing energy needs and reducing emissions.

The fourth is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It should be kept in mind that there is no panacea and each country will need to follow its own path, taking into account its national circumstances and priorities. In this regard, CCUS provides an important opportunity to meet increasing energy demand, while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, as it has applications across the energy system.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/46-27-september-202.html"
"2020-09-27","Excellencies,

I would like to commend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the leadership shown during this year’s very challenging G20 Presidency. My thanks to HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Minister of Energy, for convening this meeting and providing OPEC the opportunity to present its views on the energy market.

It is a distinct privilege to address you again, after last having spoken before you at the Extraordinary G20 Energy Ministers Meeting in April.

[Slide 3]

That meeting took place during ‘Black April,’ when global oil demand plunged by around 23 mb/d in April 2020, and there was a real risk that oversupply would have added a further 1.3 billion barrels to global oil stocks, nearly exhausting the available worldwide storage capacity. This sent crude oil futures prices into negative territory for the first time in history, down to -$38/b on 20 April 2020.

In the face of this common challenge, the leaders of the world’s top oil-producing nations, along with Energy Ministers of the G20 countries, called for an unprecedented level of cooperation. There was overwhelming consensus among major stakeholders that coordinated and decisive action was needed.

By working together, we have made great strides in restoring market balance, through a range of efforts carried out in accordance to each country’s national circumstances. These have including market-led measures and voluntary production adjustments on the supply side; offering storage space in SPR facilities; and stimulus programmes in G20 economies, totaling more than $20 trillion.

The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ (DoC) partners have provided a 2-year road map for their action to restore market balance, which began with a 9.7 mb/d reduction starting 1 May 2020, and continuing their production adjustments over the entire period up to April 2022.

[Slide 4]

Continued efforts and vigilance will be needed on all our parts. Amid ongoing uncertainties, partners in the DoC have stepped up our efforts to ensure fully and timely conformity, both collectively and individually. At the most recent meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) on 19 September, Ministers welcomed overall conformity of 102%, reiterated the importance of compensating overproduced volumes as soon as possible.

The latest forecast expects world oil demand in 2020 to contract by 9.5 mb/d, while non-OPEC liquids production is estimated to decline by 2.7 mb/d.

[Slide 5]

The expected supply/demand balance would result in OECD commercial stocks standing well above the latest five-year average in 3Q20. However, stocks would then fall in 4Q20, to stand around 123 mb above the latest five-year average.

For 2021, OECD commercial stocks are expected to stand slightly above the latest five-year average in 1Q21, then to fall below the latest five-year average over the remainder of 2021.

Therefore, our job is not yet complete. We must reach across whatever divide we face and work towards broader and consensus-driven solutions that are beneficial to our stakeholders and ultimately the entire world. It is in this spirit that I look forward to today’s deliberations.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/47-27-september-2020.html"
"2020-09-21","Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to open this year’s Workshop on Energy and Information Technology. This is the second in what will hopefully be a continuing series.

We are very fortunate to have two outstanding moderators to guide our discussions, Dr Adnan A. Shihab-Eldin of the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences and OPEC colleague for many years; and Patrick von Pattay, Vice President for Digital Portfolio and Transformation at Wintershall Dea.

I would also like to extend a special welcome to our distinguished line-up of panellists and an impressive group of participants representing industry, government and research institutions.

Today’s event is a follow-up to the workshops we held last September over the course of two days and we were very encouraged by that inaugural workshop. We hope that this year’s combined videoconference provides a unique opportunity to examine timely developments in energy technology and innovation in greater detail with the participation of leading experts.

We have two sessions, the first focusing on blue hydrogen, and the second on Information Technology in the energy sector, including the topical issues of cyber security, digitalization and blockchain.

Bill Gates once said, “Innovation is the reason our lives have improved over the last century.”

I would like to expand upon these words of wisdom by noting that the oil industry, from its earliest days in the 19th century, has been a leader in developing and utilizing technologies to the benefit of global development and human progress. In the 21st century, technological innovation, coupled with an experienced and highly-skilled work force, are driving advances in the industry’s operations across the value chain and contribute to its ever-improving environmental performance.

The OPEC Secretariat is constantly reviewing and analyzing the latest technologies emerging in our industry with the support of our Member Countries and colleagues from the industry around the world.

Blue hydrogen is one of these many exciting developments and is the subject of our first panel discussion. Blue hydrogen, which is derived from hydrocarbons, offers the potential to add significant value to our industry by turning emissions into energy.

At this stage, blue hydrogen is being used on an industrial scale and has the most practical potential in the transport sector. Coupled with carbon capture and storage or utilization, blue hydrogen could provide an abundant, reliable and clean fuel in the future.

Blue hydrogen has the additional benefit of supporting the economic diversification goals of energy-exporting countries, such as ours, while strengthening their capacity to meet their own and the world’s growing energy needs.

Our second session focuses on Information Technology.

We will be examining a broad range of trends and breakthroughs, including big data, artificial intelligence and robotics. I am glad to see some of the leading companies in Europe in these fields joining us today. By capitalizing on their potential, we have the opportunity to achieve evolutionary advances in performance and risk management, as well as operational excellence.

We also hope today’s videoconference provides a platform for exploring other pivotal innovations. These include blockchain technology – which goes hand-in-hand with the exponential growth in data and industrial knowledge. New technologies also bring their own set of challenges. We will therefore explore cyber security and the ever-growing threat landscape we face.

As we explore these developments, dear colleagues, I would like to emphasize that there is an unbreakable link between transparent, accessible data and a secure, sustainable energy supply. In the oil industry, our production, planning and logistics systems would collapse without the technologies that facilitate timely and reliable data-collection.

At OPEC, we are continually strengthening our means and commitment to facilitate the flow of information through technology, and constant improvements in our direct communication with Member Countries and key energy stakeholders.

Furthermore, we recognize the pivotal importance of technology and innovation in addressing the pressing global challenges of energy poverty and climate change.

All of these technologies and innovations represent game-changing possibilities for the oil industry and energy sector in general. However, we must be cognizant that sustained investment is essential. Our industry needs access to capital to support the development and deployment of technologies that can help us achieve a stable, inclusive and sustainable energy future.

Distinguished colleagues,

The COVID-19 crisis has ushered in a digital era that has brought tremendous changes to our way of working. Without IT, none of us would be participating in this workshop. Despite social distancing and other measures to contain the pandemic, we have been conducting business as usual thanks to innovations in remote communications and operations.

I encourage all of us to share lessons learned over the past few months and present your view on tomorrow’s digital workplace.

In closing, I would like to point out that OPEC marked its 60th Anniversary only a week ago, on September 14th. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused unimaginable loss of life and economic disruption across the world, also forced us here in OPEC to postpone our anniversary celebrations.

Nonetheless, the miracles of technology allow us to carry on with decades of OPEC tradition in supporting dialogue, cooperation and the exchange of information to the benefit of producers, consumers and the global economy at large.

Our workshop is part of the OPEC Secretariat’s ongoing research programme, which holds workshops and technical meetings that act as a forum for discussion and the exchange of ideas on some of the energy industry’s most important issues. I would like to therefore acknowledge the work of my colleagues at the Secretariat in organizing today’s workshop under such challenging circumstances.

Thank you for participating.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/48-21-september-2020.html"
"2020-07-15","Your Excellencies, distinguished ladies and gentlemen,

I want to thank you all for the warm welcome on the event of my first Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee Meeting. It is very exciting for me to be able to join you at this most essential committee meeting and take part in the hands-on work.

Thanks also to the Chair and Co-Chair for their welcoming statements. Your Excellencies, HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and Alexander Novak of the Russian Federation — your hard work and dedication have been essential in achieving the successes of this committee.

I also want to thank this committee for its perseverance, hard work and strength, putting the backbone in our decisions and ensuring that our all-important commitments which the oil market counts on are held.

I very much appreciated my inaugural bilateral meeting with the Secretary General on July 6, in which I was formally inducted into this prestigious Organization and received very valuable information and reports on oil market conditions and prospects.

OPEC and its work are not new to me. I have had the honour to be involved in the work of OPEC and its secret negotiations, when I was CEO of Sonatrach and the market was going through another deep crisis at the end of the nineties.

But it is a particular pleasure to join you now in this capacity as President of the Conference in 2020, and I count on your cooperation and support. I would like to thank my predecessor HE Mohamed Arkab for carrying the torch thus far during the year. I will convey your good wishes to my brother HE Mohamed Arkab.

Let me also assure you that Algeria remains fully committed to making the very best of this difficult year.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Algeria has played a crucial role in the entire Declaration of Cooperation process, with the DoC being given first life at the 179th Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference in Algiers on September 28, 2016. This was the game-changing conference at which OPEC Member Countries finally found common ground and reached a decision in Algiers to return to its statutory role of production management to ensure market stability.

When we look back on the accomplishments to date, the Declaration has gained depth and strength, respect and recognition over time. The Declaration, now complemented by the Charter of Cooperation, has become an essential pillar of the energy dialogue. We are a rock that the market holds to for guidance and to take calm and considered action in the face of extreme volatility.

Dear colleagues,

The industry was headed for a complete derailment in the face of the COVID-19 virus, which forced an unprecedented loss of demand due to shutdowns.

However, our OPEC+ members quickly fully engaged in solving the problem, through effective cooperation and collaboration. The achievements of OPEC+ in managing the outfall of the pandemic are widely recognized by the industry and are visible in hard data.

I believe our successes of late show once again the resilience of our Organization, especially in unprecedented times. We deserve much praise on this, our 60th anniversary.

But, we should not be complacent. Oil market balance is progressively improving. Conformity rate is satisfactory. But risks and uncertainties are huge, be they related to the pandemic or to the economic consequences. We need to remain vigilant. Today’s meeting is a great opportunity to take stock, assess the implementation of our agreement, and analyse future prospects and associated risks and uncertainties.

I wish you a successful meeting.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/54-15-july-2020.html"
"2020-07-15","Good afternoon.

Allow me first to commend the Co-Chair of the JMMC, HE Alexander Novak, Energy Minister of the Russian Federation, for his leadership and dedication in co-steering this Committee through these challenging times.

I would like to welcome OPEC President HE Abdelmadjid Attar, the new Minister of Energy of Algeria, as well as thank his predecessor, HE Mohamed Arkab, for his commitment and valuable contribution.

As ever, I thank the OPEC Secretariat for the ongoing support provided to these key meetings.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global economy and global energy markets. But we have, in turn, delivered an unprecedented response.

In April, OPEC+ agreed on the biggest production cuts ever, followed by unanimous commitment to full compliance. These were historic developments.

The meeting of G20 energy ministers underlined the need for a global, synchronized approach.

Against this background, we achieved decisive results. In June, the overall compliance level reached 107 per cent as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE made additional voluntary cuts.

Adjusting for previous over-comformity, and even excluding the extra contributions, the level of compliance stood at 95 per cent - a record level.

As I said before, this time it is different. This time, we are acting collectively, with unity and discipline. And we are seeing results.

In June, Opec+ unanimously agreed a regime of compensation for those participants who were unable to fully comply in May and June.

Adhering to this regime is crucial as it reinforces the cohesiveness of our group and the principles of collective action, fairness, and shared responsibility.

The supply side of the oil equation has been firmly and resolutely tackled.

We have momentum in our favour, but we have to resist the temptation to relax.

On the demand side, we see encouraging signs of improvement. Economies around the world are opening up.

Although this is a cautious and gradual process, and there could be localized or partial lockdowns re-imposed in some places, the recovery signs are unmistakable, both in physical and futures markets.

As we move to the next phase of the agreement, the extra supply, resulting from the scheduled easing of the production cut, will be consumed as demand continues on its recovery path.

In addition, seasonality is even more pronounced this year, due to the pandemic. In many Opec+ countries, there will be an increase in demand for utilities, as well as changes in travel patterns, boosting domestic demand for gasoline and diesel.

As a result, the impact on exports for most Opec+ participants will be limited. The additional supply reaching international markets will be barely felt.

I can tell you that in the Kingdom Saudi Arabia, due to the increase in demand from utilities and other sectors, as lockdowns ease, we estimate approximately 500,000 barrels per day of extra demand in August. So, despite a higher production target in August, there will be no change in our exports.

On top of this, the compensation schedules that have been agreed mean that the effective cut will be deeper than the headline figure of 7.7 mbd.

As the cuts ease, those participants that did not achieve full conformity will have the opportunity to meet the compensation targets with relative comfort.

Markets should always look at what is beneath the headline.

There are still risks ahead in this “crisis like no other”, as the IMF described it. The world economy is still learning how to live with the virus.

But we have shown the value of collaboration, commitment and, especially, discipline in facing this extraordinary challenge.

We have delivered on the historic April agreement, and I am confident we have the momentum to see this endeavor through, to our mutual benefit.

As ever, together we are truly stronger.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/55-15-july-2020.html"
"2020-07-15","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The month since the last Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) that took place on 18 June has been relatively sedate, particularly when placed alongside the preceding months of April and May!

This should be viewed as a positive development. It is clear that our actions taken on 12 April at the 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, and then supplemented at the 179th OPEC Ministerial Conference and the 11th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 6 June, have helped reintroduce a semblance of stability to the market.

Our decisions were well-informed and well-communicated, and they provided reassurance to the market that the OPEC+ group is proactive and fully observant of the ever-evolving oil market fundamentals.

Further evidence of the attentiveness of the OPEC+ group was seen after the last JMMC, with Participating Countries that had been unable to reach the full 100% conformity in May and June submitting plans to the OPEC Secretariat to accommodate this in July, August and September, in addition to their already agreed production adjustment for those months.

This ensures that the DoC remains fair, timely and equitable, and again gives comfort to the market that we are fully focused on our objectives of expediting the rebalancing process.

It was also positive to see last week’s technical workshop with secondary sources. It provided a facilitating platform for the secondary sources to outline how they collect and process their production data, and for countries to engage with them about questions they may have and any discrepancies between directly communicated and secondary source numbers.

It is significant that all 23 participating countries in the DoC were participants in the workshop and were fully engaged in the virtual meeting on July 9. Furthermore, they commended the workshop and urged additional bilateral talks. The Secretariat is already facilitating three such bilaterals and is also including the workshop in its Work Programme so this highly successful technical meeting becomes a regular feature of our calendar.

This is also beneficial in ensuring that the DoC is open and transparent.

It has been positive to see all participants vocalize their support for 100% monthly conformity. Looking ahead, each of us now needs to double down on the unanimous decisions we have made, fully execute the plans in place for the coming months, and reinforce the commitment of OPEC+ to a balanced and stable market.

We need to remember that strength, collaboration and positive outcomes come only through continuous effort and struggle from each and every participant in the DoC. We need to show resourcefulness and resolve. It was the great Mahatma Gandhi who once said:

“Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will.”

The importance of this is clear in the numbers that we will look at and digest today.

Oil demand has bounced back from the lows that saw daily drops of more than 20 mb/d in April, but it is still expected to witness an annual drop of 8.9 mb/d for the whole of 2020. Given considerable uncertainties, the expected rebound in 2021 will be short of covering the lost demand this year and will not reach pre-crisis levels of 100 mb/d soon.

From the perspective of the vital indicator of stocks, in May, OECD commercial oil stocks surged further by 29 mb. For March, April and May combined, the overall build was around 270 mb!

While this could have been significantly higher if there had been no DoC production adjustments – possibly over 1 billion barrels –, we need to be fully focused on bringing down the inventory builds we have seen. This is vital to the rebalancing process, and vital to helping return sustainable stability to the market. We have a solid framework for action to follow and are implementing it step-by-step. Yet we must remain vigilant as we face considerable market uncertainties in the coming months.

We have just heard the summary report of the JTC Chair, who took note of the important improvement in the conformity level in June. This improvement is a sign that every participating country recognizes that the attainment of full conformity is not only fair and equitable, but vital for the ongoing rebalancing efforts. Furthermore, the significant performance in the overall conformity level in May and June has gained wide recognition within the energy community and the oil market in particular. Yet there is still room to improve and to ensure full conformity by each and every participating country.

Here, I should also like to add that the Secretariat continues its outreach to other major oil producers beyond the DoC, as well as to consumers. We fully appreciate the importance of open channels for communication.

In this regard, since the last JMMC in June, we have held bilateral meetings with Brazil’s and Argentina’s energy ministers; taken part in an African Ministerial Roundtable to discuss the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Africa’s energy sector, co-hosted by Senegal’s Ministry of Petroleum and the IEA; participated in a session hosted by the Canada-UAE Business Council to discuss ‘Energy issues in the post-COVID-19 world’, with HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei and HE Jason Kenney, Premier of Alberta, Canada; and held the inaugural Technical Meeting of the OPEC-GECF Energy Dialogue.

It was also a great pleasure to recently brief HE Abdelmadjid Attar, Algeria’s newly appointed Minister of Energy and President of the OPEC Conference, on global oil market developments and the progress made in implementing the recent decisions of the OPEC Conference and the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings. We look forward to working with you through this JMMC, and in forthcoming Ministerial Meetings.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, HE Mohamed Arkab, for his hard work and diligence as OPEC Conference President in the first half of 2020. It has been a period like no other in the history of OPEC: he helped guide us through some extremely stormy waters.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I have been known to talk about the DoC as a Catholic marriage, and the importance of us all staying the course. In regards to this, I would like to recall a line from the legendary Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy:

“What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are but how you deal with incompatibility.”

It helps underline the fact all our countries are different, with at times varying objectives. But at the heart of the DoC is the fact that all peoples of this planet we call home benefit from a balanced market, and a sustainable stability, which is why we all continue to work through the challenges we face.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/56-15-july-2020.html"
"2020-06-30","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon.

It is my great pleasure to take part in this virtual Africa Ministerial Roundtable, which is being jointly hosted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Senegalese Ministry of Petroleum and Energy.

Allow me to express my special thanks to HE Mr. Mohamadou Makhtar Cissé, Minister of Petroleum and Energy of Senegal and Dr. Fatih Birol, IEA Executive Director for the invitation to participate in this important event.

I would also like to recognize HE Ms. Amina J. Mohammed, Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations and HE Samson Gwede Mantashe, Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy of South Africa. They are to be commended for the important work they continue to carry out in their respective roles for Africa and for Africans.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The world continues to battle the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has now surpassed 10 million cases worldwide and has taken more than a half-million lives to date. Africa currently has nearly 300,000 cases and has suffered almost 6,000 casualties.

In addition to the grave health crisis, the after-effects of the pandemic have been vast and far-reaching, resulting in one of the worst global recessions in decades.

Africa has been severely impacted, particularly in its financial, energy and public health sectors.

According to the OPEC Secretariat’s latest forecast, the continent’s GDP is expected to contract by 2.5% in 2020, and major institutions have warned that more than 20 million jobs could be in jeopardy across the continent. In its revised GDP forecasts published last week (24 June), the International Monetary Fund forecasts a deeper global recession (-4.9%), with Sub-Saharan Africa contracting by an estimated -3.2% in 2020.

This situation is even more acute when you consider that oil and other hydrocarbons make up more than 20% of the GDP of the top 10 African economies.

These adverse conditions have led to a loss of operating revenue, dwindling investment capital and a slowing of economic diversification efforts.

Excellencies, the African continent is blessed with a wide array of natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas, which make up around 7 to 8% of the world’s proven reserves, however, the fallout from this pandemic has kept Africa’s petroleum industry from reaching its full potential. Refinery capacity on the continent, for example, remains far below oil demand, and the utilization rate of the existing capacity, at around 60%, can cover only half of the daily consumption.

Energy poverty is another issue that remains at the top of the global agenda, particularly on the African continent, and further progress is now being put at risk due to the impacts of COVID-19. This is exacerbated by the intertwined challenges of energy poverty and climate change. In Africa, although it contributes less than 2% of CO2 emissions, climate change poses a real challenge and further complicates food security and energy poverty in the absence of adaptation and appropriate mitigation measures. Extreme climate patterns are projected to have devastating impacts on the African economies, potentially affecting the GDP of the entire continent through reduced agricultural yields, lowered productivity and human health impacts, not to mention intra-regional migration.

Millions of people on the continent still lack access to electricity, and progress on access to clean cooking fuels and technologies is too slow. In Sub-Saharan Africa, 47% of the population have no electricity. The number of people without access to clean fuels and cooking technology has even increased, owing to rapid population growth. As a result, about 85% of the population in this region lacked access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking as of 2019.

Going forward, the keys to enhancing much need investment in Africa’s energy sector will require a combination of a sustainably stable oil market, good governance, transparency and broad stakeholder support.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Looking ahead, there is light on the horizon as some of the world’s largest economies have begun phasing out their national lockdowns, which has ushered in a much welcomed surge in oil demand.

There is also positive momentum on the supply-side with the historic OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial decisions in April and June providing much need support to the market balancing process.

We are moving in the right direction, but we must remain vigilant in order to address a forecasted contraction in global oil demand of around 9 million barrels per day for 2020. We are not out of the woods yet.

This is a massive undertaking, and we need ALL industry stakeholders to contribute. In this context, I would like to call on all African producers to join our global efforts through the Declaration and Charter of Cooperation to achieve a sustainable oil market stability and prosperity for all. In this context, I could envisage another roundtable together with the IEA, OPEC, and APPO to convene African producing countries to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.

In closing, I would like to leave you with the eloquent words of the great leader and poet from Senegal, Leopold Sedar Senghor.

“The civilization of the twentieth century cannot be universal except by being a dynamic synthesis of all the cultural values of all civilizations. It will be monstrous unless it is seasoned with the salt of negritude, for it will be without the savor of humanity.”

In the spirit of our ongoing efforts to promote global energy cooperation, let us always seek to live out Senghor’s noble vision of honouring the cultural values of all civilizations.

"2020-06-11","Mr Chairman and esteemed guests,

It is an honour to take part in this webinar with such a distinguished panel.

I thank Ambassador Farid Shafiyev for his eloquent remarks, and the AIR Center for organizing this very timely discussion.

Before I say a few words about the current oil market, I would like to recognize Azerbaijan’s historic and eternal contributions to the oil industry.

Baku was the birthplace of the world’s first industrial oil well in 1846. We have a photo of this large wooden structure in the lobby of the OPEC Secretariat here in Vienna. It is a prominent reminder that some of the greatest early advances in drilling, pipeline development, transportation and offshore exploration and production occurred in Azerbaijan.

The country has also been a trailblazer in working with international partners and investors. The Nobel brothers were early investors in the industry and instrumental in launching the world’s first oil tanker on the Caspian Sea in 1877. This great tradition of industrial collaboration and innovation has continued since the establishment of SOCAR 30 years ago.

The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, completed 15 years ago, symbolizes the country’s position as a vital energy bridge between the Caspian region and key markets beyond, including those here in Europe.

The world owes much to Azerbaijan for promoting international energy cooperation and for being at the forefront of efforts to ensure sustainable oil market stability.

In fact, President Ilham Aliyev was the first world leader to call on OPEC and non-OPEC countries to work together in rescuing the oil industry during the 2014-2016 market downturn. President Ilham Aliyev continues to be the Beacon of light and strong supporter of the OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation. The late Energy Minister Natiq Aliyev was instrumental in the discussions in 2016 that led to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ (DoC) between the OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries. His able successor, our esteemed panellist, Parviz Shahbazov, has continued in the finest traditions of Azerbaijan, providing astute leadership, sophisticated diplomatic skills, and promoting cooperation among our countries through his unwavering support of the DoC.

Sixteen months ago, Azerbaijan hosted the 13th Meeting of the OPEC and non-OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, which provides the strategic guidance to the DoC countries. The travel restrictions necessitated by COVID-19 interrupted plans for another Ministerial Meeting in Baku this year following the generous invitation of the President Ilham Aliyev when he granted me audience in Davos at the World Economic Forum in January 2020.

Azerbaijan is also an observer in the Gas Exporting Countries Forum. Its involvement in the GECF is a further extension of Azerbaijan’s global engagement in common with many OPEC Members Countries and DoC participating countries.

OPEC is very proud to have Azerbaijan in the DoC and extremely grateful for its high-level support. As our Organization marks its 60th anniversary this year, it would be a pleasure to welcome Azerbaijan as a member of the OPEC family.

Mr Chairman and esteemed guests,

It has been exactly three months to the day since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. On that day, March 11th, there were slightly more than 118,000 confirmed cases in the world, and 4,300 fatalities. Today there are more than 7.2 million confirmed cases with at least 411,000 lives lost. On Sunday (June 7th), the WHO reported more than 136,000 new cases of this virus, setting a record for a single day.

In the flash of an eye, we have witnessed the worst public health crisis, the most severe economic downturn, and the most alarming oil market slump of modern times. The oil industry is weaker and more vulnerable today than it was just a few months ago.

Allow me to reflect on events of the past few weeks and offer some perspectives going forward.

April stands out as a month without precedent in the history of OPEC. We saw global oil demand slump by around 24 to 26 mb/d. April 20th was ‘Bloody Monday’ for the oil industry. On that day, the price of the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate prompt contract for May plunged by $56/b to nearly minus-$38/b – the first time the benchmark has ever fallen into negative territory. For a brief moment, producers had to pay people to take their oil. Brent crude, the international benchmark, dipped to $19/b, down by around 72% from where it started the year.

Overall in April, the ICE Brent contract plummeted 21% m-o-m, while the NYMEX WTI contract lost 45% of its value amid bearish market sentiment.

Furthermore, there was a real risk that oversupply would have added a further 1.3 billion barrels to global crude oil stocks, nearly exhausting the available worldwide storage capacity.

Assuming we hit bottom during ‘Black April’, we are not out of the trough yet.

Our analysts at the OPEC Secretariat expect a severe global economic downturn this year, with the economy contracting by 3.4% compared to global GDP growth of 2.9% in 2019. The most recent forecasts from the World Bank reveal an even more pessimistic GDP growth outlook of minus-5.2%, while the OECD just released their forecast (June 10th) showing minus-6.0% growth for 2020. These downside revisions merely reflect the high risks and associated uncertainties.

We project a historic decline in world oil demand of nearly 9.1 mb/d this year, to around 90.6 mb/d. Before COVID-19, we expected world oil demand to top 100 mb/d in 2020, up by 1.08 mb/d from 2019.

Investment is another significant concern as we navigate through the rest of this year. Our projections show CAPEX in non-OPEC countries plummeting by 23% in 2020, to about half the $741 billion record set in 2014. Energy is among the key commodities most affected by the pandemic-induced slump.

As we know from the oil market’s sharp downturn in 2014-2016, unpredictable investment flows have severe long-term consequences for the industry. It takes years to reverse the damage caused by the loss of highly skilled jobs and technological know-how, along with setbacks in exploration and production.

I can speak for OPEC Member Countries in pointing out that sudden dips in revenue and unpredictable investment make it a herculean task to finance economic and energy diversification, which are so important to current and future development. These uncertainties also affect current operating budgets at a time when additional support is needed to strengthen health systems and stimulate economic activity.

The road ahead is cluttered with many uncertainties for the economy and the energy markets. Yet despite the many downside risks, we are already seeing evidence of reduced volatility in the oil market. The prices on both Brent and WTI have now bounced back to the levels we saw before lockdown measures were enacted around the world, with both benchmarks now oscillating around $40/b.

I believe a large part of the stabilization we have seen over the past few weeks can be attributed to two interconnected factors: the unparalleled actions undertaken by the countries in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ to arrest the market collapse and restore order; and the unprecedented support we have received in the process.

HE Parviz Shahbazov played a leading role in these achievements – often displaying his extraordinary diplomatic finesse and acumen.

In a series of marathon virtual meetings between April 9th and 12th, the DoC participants agreed to undertake the largest oil production adjustments in history. The resulting adjustments of 9.7 mb/d for May and June, followed by tapered adjustments until the end of April 2022, were designed to halt the market’s dramatic slide and provide a platform for stabilization, recovery and growth.

The 23 DoC countries held our second significant series of virtual gatherings last weekend with a watchful eye on the ongoing market uncertainties. On Saturday, June 6th, the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministers extended the April oil production adjustments for a third month, to the end of July, and reaffirmed the two-year window of adjustments.

Furthermore, the Ministerial Meetings unanimously reiterated all participating countries’ commitment to achieving full conformity to the adjustments.

For the first time since the DoC’s inception in 2016, the countries subscribed to the concept of “compensation” by those that were unable to reach 100% conformity in May and June. These countries now have a means to make up the difference in July, August and September. This key outcome lends further support to the market.

The participating countries also strengthened their monitoring mechanism, which is a main contributor to the DoC’s ongoing success in responding to changing market conditions. The Joint Technical Committee and the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries will meet next week, on June 17th and 18th, and maintain a regular monthly meeting schedule for the remainder of the year.

Mr Chairman and esteemed guests,

The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has been a game-changer for the industry. I believe the market would be in a far more fragile state today were it for the powerful response mechanism provided by this unique and voluntary framework.

From its beginning, the DoC has strengthened our flexibility and preparedness. It has allowed a diverse group of oil-producing nations to work together to ensure a reliable, economical and secure energy supply to the benefit of producers, consumers, investors and the worldwide economy.

Yet the sheer scale of COVID-19’s impact on the oil market necessitated a broader collective support.

In the lead-up to our decisive DoC meetings in April, the leaders of the world’s top oil-producing nations, along with Energy Ministers of the G20 countries, called for unprecedented levels of cooperation and encouraged us to act – and act decisively. There was overwhelming consensus that coordinated action was needed to avert a market collapse, which in turn would have devastating economic consequences.

Oil industry majors and independents have added their voice of support and in many cases have taken market-driven steps that have complemented the DoC-led stabilization efforts. Leading policymakers, analysts and industry stakeholders welcomed the outcome of last weekend’s OPEC and non-OPEC meetings.

Building on this momentum, OPEC has carried out a series of discussions with stakeholders in the US, Canada, Europe, India and China to strengthen understanding and awareness. We have also held regular discussions with select universities, think tanks, and the finance and energy institutions and agencies to exchange information and perspectives, and encourage deeper cooperation.

Today, OPEC and its Member Countries are stronger, more nimble and better positioned to confront extreme challenges like COVID-19 thanks to our cooperation and engagement with others.

We have also grown stronger because of the visionary decision of the OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries to establish the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ nearly a year ago, in July 2019. The ‘Charter’ offers a platform to go beyond market-balancing efforts and address issues such as climate change, the energy transition and energy access in a coherent and inclusive way.

We cannot predict what will happen next with COVID-19. We can hold out hope that there will soon be a vaccine against this virus, that our industries and businesses will recover quickly, and that we can resume the daily routines, as we knew them a few months ago.

Our experience in confronting the market risks posed by COVID-19 underscores the importance of high-level and multilateral cooperation. We must not lose the opportunity to work towards broader and consensus-driven solutions that are beneficial to the industry and ultimately the entire world. Our door is always open to others who share our values, concerns and hopes for a better future.

I would like to close with a very apt quotation from the legendary poet Nizami Ganjavi who said:

“In the hour of adversity be not without hope, for crystal rain falls from black clouds.”

Ambassador Shafiyev, I again thank the AIR Center for organizing this well-timed and extremely valuable discussion. Our interventions today provide a platform for informed and constructive dialogue, and a window to diverse regional perspectives.

Thank you for your attention and I look forward to our discussion.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/58-11-june-2020.html"
"2020-06-06","Your Highness, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

Allow me to begin by offering my condolences and those of Algeria to the family of our colleague and dear friend, Mr. Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, as well as to the delegation of IR Iran and all who mourn his tragic passing. While we are saddened greatly by his untimely passing, we take comfort from the rich legacy of devotion to service and technical expertise that he leaves behind.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Future historians may describe the last month of April as ‘Black April,’.Global lockdowns, closed borders and social distancing caused global economic contraction, reduced mobility, and led as a consequence to an unprecedented demand destruction. Coupled with large supplies, this resulted in a sharp increase of global petroleum stocks.

In stark contrast, the month of May has been much more hopeful for our industry. Supply and demand have tentatively began to realign, the market has seen less volatility and other positive developments are afoot.

With regard to demand, we are seeing some relaxation of the lockdown restrictions, the implementation of accommodative monetary policies and fiscal stimulus measures.

On the supply side, production adjustments have become operational as of 1 May. Furthermore, several countries have also revealed additional voluntary adjustments for June. This is an act of responsibility, for which we are grateful . We encourage all participating countries to fulfil their commitments. The recovery we have seen has been gradual and is extremely fragile. We need renewed commitment to see its full realization.

I would like to conclude by paying tribute to HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Minister of Energy of Saudi Arabia, who has done an exemplary job in forging consensus, and rallying support for our cause.

HE Alexander Novak, has continued to act as the critical link between OPEC and non-OPEC, steering the group through his dignified leadership and commitment to duty. We are extremely grateful for this.

And of course, we remain very appreciative to HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General and all the staff at the OPEC Secretariat. They too have altered their working methods during the lockdown in Austria, however, there has been no change to the level of service excellence we have come to expect of them, despite the challenging circumstances.

Allow me to conclude by emphasising that although the COVID-19 pandemic is a terrible human tragedy; some hope may stem from this experience. As we have seen, it is only if the nations of the world come together and act as one to surmount global challenges, can future crises be avoided. This belief has guided our Organization for the last sixty years and will undoubtedly guide us for sixty more, on Allah’s will.

Thank you for your kind attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/59-6-june-2020.html"
"2020-06-06","Excellencies,

There have been almost two months since the historic 9th and 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings on 9 and 12 April. Looking back on this period, it has perhaps felt less like two months, and more like two years.

It has been a rollercoaster ride, but what has been consistent over this period is the commitment of participants in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) to the voluntary production adjustments, the largest and longest in the history of OPEC, OPEC+ and the oil industry, and to rebalancing and stabilizing the market.

The month of April was a ghastly one for the world, the global economy and the oil market, despite being positively punctuated by the DoC production adjustments.

The COVID-19 pandemic was at its height, with widespread economic lockdowns, businesses shut in, flights grounded and many of the world’s population confined to their homes to help contain this unprecedented global health crisis. A paralysis had gripped continents, nations, industries and people.

As we all bore witness too, the effects on the oil market were unparalleled. Large-scale oil demand destruction, at a level never seen before; a massive supply and demand imbalance; and, global storage capacity filling quickly. Perhaps the epiphany of this was April 20, or what some have called ‘Bloody Monday’, when the WTI May contract went negative, ending the day at close to minus $40/b.

The panic this day caused was palpable. It left CEOs, oil companies, traders and analysts open-mouthed; how could this have happened? It left us all searching for answers. There are a number of possible explanations, but in reality it all came down to the huge mismatch in supply and demand fundamentals.

However, what has been evident in the period since the start of May, when the 9.7 mb/d DoC production adjustments kicked in, has been the growing, albeit, tentative signs of recovery.

This recovery has also been ably aided by the welcome additional adjustments from Saudi Arabia (1 mb/d); the UAE (100 tb/d); Kuwait (80 tb/d); and Oman (10-15 tb/d). This display of leadership is of immense value to the DoC. Moreover, we have also seen announcements of voluntary adjustments from several countries, such as Norway and Canada, oil company statements revising downward their production plans and shutting in supply, and, of course, many economies emerging from lockdowns.

Here, I should also like to recall the positive statements we have received from consumers, not only through the G20 Extraordinary Energy Ministers Meeting that sandwiched our two Ministerial Meetings in March, but also in various Secretariat briefings we have held with China, India and the European Union.

The very early green shoots of a revival are evident; we do hope that we have turned a corner. Nevertheless, global oil demand is still expected to shrink by more than 17 mb/d in the 2Q20, and while it is expected to ease in the second half of the year, for the whole of 2020 the contraction is still forecast to be around 9.1 mb/d. This will bring global oil demand to 90.6 mb/d; back to levels last seen before the 2014-2016 market downturn.

It underscores the fact that we cannot rest on our laurels. We need to maintain the laser focus on helping bring supply and demand back into balance and providing a more stable market in the coming months. This is not the time to stand back and admire what we have achieved thus far; we do not want to jeopardize these successes in any way.

We also need to appreciate that the waters remain choppy, and as we navigate our journey it will not be plain sailing, but we have to remain resolute. It is in the interests of us all. It was the legendary Russian poet, Bulat Okudzhava, that once said:

“Let us join hands my dear friends. We won’t get lost if we are together.”

Together we can ensure that our hard-earned achievements are not compromised or lost.

Following on from the 179th Meeting of the OPEC Conference earlier today, it is vital that we look to lay out possible pathways for the coming months, the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. This will enable all DoC partners to remain proactive, focus on 100% conformity, and help further rebalance fundamentals and reduce volatility in the oil market.

Before I conclude I think it is important to once again thank HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman and HE Alexander Novak, who as co-Chairs at the two April Extraordinary Ministerial Meetings, ably and astutely guided us to the historic decisions. As co-Chairs today, we look forward to their continued wise guidance and forthright commitment to the DoC.

This catholic marriage between OPEC and our non-OPEC partners remains sacrosanct!

With that I would like to pass the floor to…

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/60-6-june-2020.html"
"2020-06-06","Excellencies,

Since the OPEC Ministerial Conference last met on March 5, just over three months ago, the world has been turned upside down.

It has been an unprecedented 100 days. The COVID-19 pandemic has pervaded almost every aspect of our daily lives, with widespread lockdowns, businesses shuttered in, economies in distress and most people confined to travel in their local area.

Every economic sector was impacted by this fast moving, but silent invader. This has been clearly evident in global oil. Every producer has been impacted; no-one has immunity.

To put the scale of the transformation in some context we only need to look at the change in expected economic and oil demand growth.

Expected 2020 global GDP growth has fallen dramatically from a positive 2.8% at our March 5 meeting to a negative 3.4% today.

Expected 2020 global oil demand growth has dropped from a positive 0.5 mb/d at our March meeting, to an astounding negative 9.1 mb/d today.

To help counter this, OPEC, and our partners in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ (DoC) agreed at two Extraordinary Meetings on April 9 and 12 to new voluntary production adjustments: 9.7 mb/d, in May and June 2020; 7.7 mb/d from 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2020; and 5.8 mb/d from 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2022.

These are the largest and longest in the history of OPEC, OPEC+ and the oil industry, with the focus on rebalancing and stabilizing the market, in the interests of both producers and consumers. This unparalleled commitment, and the unity and courage for the common cause of oil market stability from OPEC, and non-OPEC participants in the DoC has been widely welcomed.

Additionally, we have seen welcome additional adjustments from Saudi Arabia (1 mb/d); the UAE (100 tb/d); a Kuwait (80 tb/d); and Oman (10-15 tb/d). This forthright leadership should be lauded. We have also seen announcements of voluntary adjustments from several countries, such as Norway and Canada, and oil company statements revising downward their production plans and shutting in supply.

This dramatic change in non-OPEC supply growth is also clearly exhibited by the numbers. At our March meeting, non-OPEC liquids production in 2020 was forecast to grow by 2.2 mb/d, whereas now the forecast is for a huge decline of 3.5 mb/d.

The DoC had to act in a decisive manner, otherwise the oversupply would have added more than a billion barrels to global crude oil stocks, and quickly exhausted the available global crude oil storage capacity.

In this regard, it is important to recall that we saw a peak in OECD commercial stocks of 403 million barrels above the five-year average in July 2016, which took us three years to clear.

The importance of this was made very clear in April; a month that may go down as the worst in the history of the oil industry.

The COVID-19 pandemic was at its height and the oil market was hemorrhaging; demand was in freefall and global storage capacity was filling quickly.

The nadir of this was April 20, or what some have called ‘Bloody Monday’, when the WTI May contract tumbled by more than $50, ending the day at an incredible negative US$37.63/b, the first ever plunge into negative territory. In other words, sellers were paying buyers!

It was a visceral moment for the market. To put the abrupt nature of this slide into some context – WTI broke below $1 less than a half hour before the settlement, but in those final 30 minutes it dropped another $38!

This sent shockwaves through the industry, with many analysts calling tank tops for storage facilities in the coming weeks.

Since the start of the new DoC production adjustments on May 1, however, we have seen a distinct change in sentiment. Slowly, but surely, we are seeing tentative indications of a recovery, and given the amount of production that has been adjusted, voluntary or involuntary, there is now no signs of storage facilities reaching capacity.

We do hope that the worst is behind us. We have turned a corner, but the numbers underscore that we need to keep our foot on the pedal, and hence firmly on the steering wheel. We cannot get complacent and believe that our work is done.

Global oil demand is still expected to shrink by more than 17 mb/d in the 2Q20, and while the level is expected to ease in the second half of the year, for the whole of 2020, the contraction is still over 9 mb/d.

The decision taken in April was a clear demonstration of the commitment, motivation and dedication of OPEC and our valuable partners in the DoC, led by the Russian Federation, in terms of looking to aid the short-term and providing a platform for recovery and growth in the coming months and years. We now need to ensure we all carry this progress forward, with 100% conformity from all participants, and further reinforce the commitment we have shown in recent months.

We cannot believe that the path ahead will be flat and straight; it will no doubt be bumpy and circuitous.

But we need to seize the moment, work with a rising tide of hope, and ensure our objectives are met. In this, I recall a line from William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar:

“There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves, or lose our ventures.”

We need to lead the way at this OPEC Ministerial Conference and be responsive and proactive as we look to help further rebalance fundamentals and try and reduce volatility in the oil market.

The commitment that OPEC Member Countries have shown thus far, as well as all participants in the DoC, has been rightly welcomed. Let us keep this momentum.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/61-6-june-2020.html"
"2020-06-04","Distinguished speakers, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

I am truly delighted to welcome you to this 7th edition of our Technical Meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation, which is being held for the first time via tele-conference. I would like to extend a special welcome to our guest HE Shaikh Mohamed Al Khalifa, Minister of Oil of Bahrain.

Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,

We live in strange and unprecedented times. The world as we knew it ceased to exist a few months ago, with the appearance and rapid advancement of an invisible adversary — COVID-19.

This pandemic caused a global economic downturn of unparalleled proportions and strained health care systems in hard-hit countries well past their limits. Unemployment has hit rates not seen since the Great Depression in many of the world’s major economies. And lockdowns have led to the destruction of vast swaths of oil demand. This in turn has led to devastation in the industry, with lost jobs, shutdowns, bankruptcies and massive losses in investment.

But as that great leader of the transportation revolution, Henry Ford said: “When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.”

The headwinds we have faced in the oil industry, and as humankind, over the past several months have often seemed insurmountable. We could only helplessly watch as oil demand fell practically overnight to jaw-dropping historical lows.

We are already seeing evidence of a market recovery and hope to never again experience a day like ‘Black Monday’ – when West Texas Intermediate took a nosedive into negative territory for the first time ever on April 20th. Prices have recovered since then to a range of between $36-40/b.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We must not forget that in the face of adversity, blessings and unknown strengths often come to the fore. We have seen animosity between adversaries dissolve overnight and the world has learned how to work together on a much grander scale than ever before to overcome this deadly scourge.

Declaration of Cooperation producers got past their differences to agree upon the biggest oil adjustment decision of all time in early April. Leaders of the G20 and heads of state of major oil producing countries have pledged unprecedented support for OPEC+ activities and made real contributions to market stability.

The upstanding behaviour of DoC participants in these dark times has elevated the esteem of this collaborative platform to incredible, new heights. Practically every story in the media referring to the oil market positively mentions the OPEC+ decision and its stabilizing influence.

Production adjustments as agreed at the 9th and 10th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings on 9 and 12 April 2020 have set us on a course to aid in restoring stability to an energy market that was in drastic need of it.

Downward adjustments in overall crude oil production by 9.7 mb/d started on 1 May 2020, for an initial period of two months, with a subsequent adjustment for 6 months of 7.7 mb/d, followed by a 5.8 mb/d adjustment for a period of 16 months, to 30 April 2022.

With the DoC decision as an anchor, the market-driven shutdown of millions of barrels of production in North America, and further commitments from several DoC participants, the oil market has started to veer back on course. The emerging production profile shows encouraging signs of rising conformity by DoC countries, at great cost to their local industries and countries. This speaks volumes about the dedication of our group.

I am very happy to report that a month after the implementation began of the largest-ever internationally coordinated production adjustments, oil has responded swiftly and positively. The physical market has tightened and prices have recovered somewhat. Storage tanks are not filling as rapidly, and previously wide differentials between near and forward months are narrowing.

Demand is already rebounding in some of the world’s biggest energy consumers. China recently reported oil demand appears to be returning to pre-crisis levels. Promising signs of demand recovery are also being seen in India. World demand is expected to come back further in June, as stringent lockdowns start to loosen.

But we cannot be complacent. The recovery remains tentative, and continued rebalancing of shattered markets will continue to require both a strong recovery in demand and the determined implementation of pledges made under the DoC, as well as the market shut-ins.

I think we can say without a shadow of doubt that the high hopes that we all had when we signed the historic Declaration of Cooperation back in December of 2016 have been more than met.

Distinguished colleagues,

In the past, our technical meetings have covered various topical issues, but the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting demand destruction is dominating all discussion. This is not only about dealing with the emergency situation we find ourselves in today, but finding a path to what may be a different tomorrow.

Our first session will cover the impact of COVID-19 on the world economy, oil supply and demand, oil trade as well as oil stocks and the implication for the balance of demand and supply.

Meanwhile, in our second session we will discuss the impact of the DoC decisions on the global oil market from January 2017 to date.

Based on the latest issue of our monthly in May, the Secretariat projects that the world economy will shrink by 3.4% in 2020, following global economic growth of 2.9% the previous year. World oil demand growth in 2020 is expected to drop by a staggering 9.07 mb/d, with the worst impact seen in this quarter. We expect demand for the year to be around 90.59 mb/d – back to levels last seen before the 2014-2016 market downturn.

Along with dire economic projections across the board, we see very worrying signs regarding the effect the current crisis will have on investment in the oil industry. We are already experiencing a repeat of the 2014-2016 scenario, when many petroleum companies applied for bankruptcy. Many others are teetering on the edge of failure.

Non-OPEC countries will receive a massive blow, with CAPEX projected to drop by a whopping 23% y-o-y in 2020, to about half the $741 billion record set in 2014. Bringing stability back to the oil market will help protect the highly skilled jobs, innovation and advances in efficiency that are needed now more than ever, for both the world’s economies and the oil industry to recover. DoC countries, in particular, which rely so heavily on the oil industry, may be faced with pulling back on essential diversification efforts. These are the same countries that will be hardest hit by the energy transition.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I am very pleased to have some of the best minds and top leaders in our industry from around the world joining us by WebEx to guide us and share their perspectives. Some of these speakers have already been providing their sage advice and observations to OPEC during a series of special meetings.

Over the course of a month, from 17 April to 15 May, during the lockdown, we hosted a series of virtual round-table briefings with leading policymakers, select energy experts and market analysts from international institutions and agencies, the oil industry and the financial community to assess the pandemic’s impact on the world economy and the oil market in particular.

There was consensus among participants that the decisive and proactive output adjustments agreed at the April ministerial meetings will gradually boost the oil market and contribute to a global economic recovery.

I encourage all the esteemed delegations to proactively participate in this opportunity and present your views within this forum.

Finally, I want to take a moment to commemorate the life of a highly esteemed colleague and friend of our family. Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, the country’s veteran representative to, and longest-serving member of the Board of Governors of OPEC.

Mr Ardebili was a man of great honour who served his country valiantly through many crisis. He was an essential part of OPEC, serving on the Board since 2013 and on other occasions in the past, including from 1995 to 2008. He also was Chairman for several terms and was a member of several strategic committees.

Mr. Ardebili’s presence will be greatly missed in our meetings, at our discussions and in our hearts. May he rest in peace.

I wish us all a very stimulating, interactive and productive discussion today.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/64-4-june-2020.html"
"2020-06-03","Distinguished Delegates and Colleagues,

Good morning and welcome to this 133rd Meeting of the Economic Commission Board – our first meeting held by videoconference.

OPEC and its esteemed Member Countries have broken a lot of new ground throughout the crisis spawned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through virtual meetings like this, we have ushered in the largest stabilization effort in oil market history; carried out global discussions to expand knowledge and awareness about the unprecedented economic and oil market challenges we face; held the 156th Meeting of the Board of Governor’s just last week; and continue to maintain the important day-to-day work of the OPEC Secretariat and the services we provide to Member Countries.

Before I shed more light on these accomplishments and review with you the general market conditions, let me welcome the two newest members of the Board, Mr Fernand Epigat of Gabon and Mr Mohammed Saadoon Mohsin of Iraq.

We look forward to your constructive contributions to this Board.

Esteemed Members of the Board, colleagues,

In December, our Member Countries – together with our partners in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ – proactively adjusted production by 500,000 b/d to a then-record 1.7 mb/d. This decision demonstrated the resolve of all participating countries to ensure market stability and predictability going into a new year – and indeed a new decade.

But no one could have predicted the fast-moving situation that would transpire with COVID-19. In a very short time, a wave of shock and mounting uncertainty swept aside the hopeful start to the year and the new decade.

At the 178th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference on March 5th and 6th, the full market impact of COVID-19 was unclear. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) did not declare a pandemic until March 11th.

Little did we know at the time that the epicentre of COVID-19 would make a dramatic shift from one continent to another, extending the economic destruction and oil market meltdown.

Over the past three months, we have experienced an economic and oil market collapse without precedent. Even the most pessimistic outlooks for 2020 that were discussed during the 132nd Meeting of this Board last November look a world away now. We are on a completely different page, given the economic and market realities we face today in the face of the tragic COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the fight against COVID-19 is far from over. We still do not know what the future holds. With well over 6 million cases worldwide, and more than 370,000 lives lost so far, the risks of a sharper downturn remain until we have a safe and effective means to protect against this deadly virus.

Let me briefly highlight a few points of comparison using data from our last meeting and the latest assessments we have before us today.

In November, we projected global economic growth of 3.0% in 2020. Notably, there was a great degree of positivity among attendees at the World Economic Forum Meeting in Davos, which took place January 21st-24th 2020. Looking forward, various leaders and commentators were optimistic regarding the prospects for the global economy in 2020. How times have changed!

We now expect a severe recession with the world economy shrinking by 3.4% this year, following global economic growth of 2.9% in 2019. All our Member Countries are heading into recession.

Subject to further lockdown measures and health-related developments, the risk to the global forecast remains skewed to the downside.

Seven months ago, we expected world oil demand to grow by 1.08 mb/d in 2020. Our latest projection shows a historic decline of nearly 9.1 mb/d this year. The worst impact is likely to be in the second quarter, mostly in OECD Americas and Europe, with transportation and industrial fuels affected the most. Global demand for the year is likely to be around 90.6 mb/d – with higher consumption expected in 2H20 than in 1H20.

Furthermore, the current crisis is a serious blow to investment. The market collapse has already pushed petroleum companies over the edge and poses an existential threat to others in the oil industry.

We now expect CAPEX in non-OPEC countries to plummet by 23% y-o-y in 2020, to about half the $741 billion record set in 2014. This puts highly skilled jobs, innovation and advances in efficiency at risk at a time when the industry – and the global economy – need them the most.

For our Member Countries, the current circumstances and financial setback will sharply curtail efforts to diversify, finance technological innovation, and invest in the energy transition.

As market conditions continued to deteriorate at the end of 1Q20 and the start of the second quarter, it became clear that urgent action was needed. Key stakeholders from around the world were lining up behind the DoC countries to support proactive, pre-emptive and decisive action to prevent a total market meltdown.

Between April 9th and 12th, we held two Extraordinary Ministerial Meetings of the OPEC and non-OPEC countries in the DoC. In addition, we participated in the Extraordinary G20 Energy Ministers Meeting (April 10th) under the able chairmanship of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which holds the presidency of the G20 this year.

Action was needed, and act we did. The production adjustments agreed at the April 2020 meetings, totalling 9.7 mb/d for two months, followed by phased reductions in the adjustment levels over a further 22 months, were unparalleled in scope and duration. The two-year period for output adjustments demonstrated the full commitment of all stakeholders to achieve common goals.

Some OPEC Member Countries – led by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, along with Oman – have gone further with additional voluntary adjustments of around 1.2 mb/d. These contributions helped to reduce the risk of tank tops and offered fresh assurance and confidence to the market.

Another pivotal outcome of the April meetings has been the encouragement and outpouring of support the DoC participants have received. This support came from the very highest levels of government, and from the very largest global oil producers. The largest producers acknowledged their mutual interdependence, and the benefits of working together to return confidence to the global oil market.

In addition, we have seen commitments from independent producers, and engagement from the G20 and other international bodies, on the need for proactive and coordinated action to stabilize the world’s most important energy source. There are stakeholders in Canada, Norway, Colombia, Brazil and many other producing nations who have added their support to broader collaboration to stave off further erosion of the market.

Following the April DoC meetings, we organized and hosted a series of virtual round-table briefings with select energy policymakers and experts from international institutions, consulting firms, the oil industry, the financial community and think tanks from around the world. These roundtables also featured the European Commission; and oil consuming countries, such as China and India.

The discussions provided a productive and timely platform to exchange views on the historic outcomes of the Ministerial Meetings, the unparalleled economic and oil market conditions resulting from COVID-19, and the public health measures taken to control the pandemic.

It is important to note that these roundtable briefings began during ‘Black April’, a month of strikingly unprecedented developments and extreme volatility. During the month, we witnessed the largest collapse in global oil demand of around 24 to 26 mb/d. And, of course, there was a day that shook the market to its foundations, when on April 20th the price of NYMEX WTI in the futures market plunged by $56/b to minus-$37.6/b, the first ever plunge into negative territory. In other words, sellers were paying buyers!

The drop came one day before the expiry of the front-month May WTI contract, amid low liquidity; a delivery problem for physical May crude at the Cushing hub with traders rushing to reserve storage capacity given expectations that tanks would reach maximum capacity in the coming weeks; and with some speculators still holding open contracts scrambling to exit long positions.

This all created a severe squeeze on the market. It has been described as “dramatic”, “scary” and “visceral”. WTI broke below $1, less than a half hour before the settlement, but in those final 30 minutes it dropped another $38!

The actions taken by OPEC+ in April stopped short the race to zero dollar oil. The decision taken by our Members, and our partners in the DoC, has been pivotal in reducing volatility and bringing back some semblance of stability to the market.

Holding the recent energy roundtables during such an exceptional time has proven to be of enormous strategic importance by drawing on the expertise of leading analysts, scholars and economists. They have reinforced OPEC’s image as a leading force in achieving a stable and secure energy supply for the world. They have demonstrated again our desire to maintain the momentum in achieving broad and inclusive dialogue and cooperation. They have provided a deeper understanding of the market and conditions affecting it.

It was further noted during these productive discussions that the rebalancing process may be longer than anticipated under the prevailing uncertainties and downside risks, and given that global inventories appear to be continuing to build, albeit at a much lower rate than the record pace of late March and April.

The pace of the global economic rebound – particularly given the very uncertain economic paths of the world’s two largest economies, the US and China – as well as a recovery in global trade, will be central to the oil market’s revival.

It is clear that the post-pandemic world will be much different and require thorough and forward-looking reflections. It will take time for a new equilibrium to emerge, not only in terms of a balanced market, but among producing countries as well.

No individual stakeholder can have all the answers. It is only by reaching out and deepening the dialogue between reputable institutions that we can provide a better and broader sense of the rapidly evolving energy landscape.

We continue to work closely with the International Energy Agency – including regular consultations – and International Energy Forum to ensure open lines of communication between producers and consumers. Together, we collaborate to ensure access to accurate, timely and transparent data about the markets.

Let me also convey my gratitude to all the OPEC Member Countries for their support, and their solidarity, throughout this unparalleled international emergency. Moreover, it is a moment to pay our greatest respects to the governments of our Member Countries on their extraordinary efforts to contain the pandemic that has enveloped the entire humanity.

The challenges created by the COVID-19 tragedy will require special attention to ensure that the OPEC Conference has access to quality and timely data, market information, and fact-based assessments on current and projected conditions.

In addition, it is essential that the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of the DoC is equipped with the latest and best information so it can make apt and timely recommendations under rapidly changing circumstances. Strategic decisions can only be made when underpinned by up-to-date and in-depth analysis. Indeed, the link between transparent data and better predictability, and a secure and sustainable energy supply, will grow in importance in the months and years to come.

Esteemed Members of the Board, colleagues,

As you are aware, the deliberations and output from these Board meetings provide the basis upon which key decisions are made by the Ministerial Conference. We are constantly striving to improve our research and deepen our analysis to provide the best possible input to this Board.

I would like to thank the OPEC Secretariat Staff for their dedication and forbearance throughout this stressful emergency. I applaud all the work they put into ensuring that this and all the important business of the Organization takes place without interruption and in compliance with the Austrian government’s containment regulations.

Work is in earnest to finalise the release of the 55th edition of the Annual Statistical Bulletin and the 14th edition of the World Oil Outlook in November.

This year’s WOO extends the outlook by another five years, to 2045. It will feature a chapter on the major uncertainties related to future oil demand and supply, taking into account factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A version of the WOO will be provided to the Special Meeting of this Board in September this year. Your valuable input will feed into the final publication of the WOO in early November.

I would point out that these are not only important sources of information for our Member Countries. They are must-have publications for the industry, the media, analysts and many other stakeholders. Our publications – along with the regularly updated data and information that we make available through our website – add enormous value to the Organization’s strategic outreach to the broader community. They also underscore our commitment to dialogue, cooperation and transparency.

As we approach the 60th Anniversary of OPEC in September, the Secretariat will publish a tome on the history of the Organization to date. It will chronicle the many great moments over the years – including the challenges we have overcome through cooperation, and the opportunities we have embarked on through shared purpose and vision. It will be a timely reflection of six decades of OPEC history in the year of COVID-19.

I am confident that this Organization will emerge from the current challenging and unprecedented times more united, stronger and more forward-looking. We are not out of the woods yet. But the historic OPEC+-led response to the current crisis is already helping to reduce volatility, stabilize the oil market, and to provide a platform for recovery and growth in the coming months and years.

Our meeting this time is shorter than planned given the special circumstances and virtual environment.

We will also keep the presentations – which were shared with you in advance – very focused to allow sufficient time for discussion. We will do our utmost to run an efficient meeting in keeping with the schedule.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/62-3-june-2020.html"
"2020-05-28","Thank you, Mr Chairman, for your extremely thoughtful and inspiring comments.

For the benefit of our colleagues who have not had the opportunity to meet you in person, I will provide a brief introduction on the extensive experience that you bring to this Board.

The Chairman Magloire Menie Akoue has more than 20 years of public service in the Gabon Ministry of Oil, Gas, Hydrocarbons and Mines. During this time, he has focused on technical control of E&P activities and cost controls, and currently serves as technical advisor in the Ministry. Engineer Menie Akoue holds an Advanced Master's Degree in Petroleum Geology and has an outstanding international record, with stints of service in different global oil companies and other entities in France, Canada and the US.

A warm welcome, Mr Chairman, to the OPEC family. We all look forward to your leadership of this Board at such a decisive moment in our history.

I also wish to thank your predecessor as Chairman, Mr Agustín Mba Okomo, the Governor for Equatorial Guinea, for his exemplary leadership in 2019.

Mr Chairman, I am moved by your graceful remarks about our dear brother and colleague, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili. This is indeed a time of grief for all of us at the Organization. OPEC’s greatness is owed in part to Hossein’s enduring contributions, leadership and long service to this esteemed Board.

We will always remember Hossein as a global citizen, accomplished scholar and astute diplomat of international stature. He was a gallant representative of his home country, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the doyen of the Board, and a longstanding pillar of OPEC.

Hossein was a beloved friend of mine – a friendship of 34 years made and strengthened by our lifelong involvement in OPEC. I will find everlasting inspiration in his wisdom, thoughtful guidance and tireless commitment to our collective success.

In our late colleague’s honour, the Secretariat has produced a brief memorial video which I would like to share with you. It was first aired during the signing of a book of condolences at the Secretariat in the presence of the Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran, HE Kazem Gharib Abadi. We will share this book with Hossein’s loved ones as a token of our lasting respect.

[SHARE VIDEO ON SCREEN]

May Almighty Allah accept our colleague and great friend in Jannat Alferdous.

Esteemed Members of the Board,

I would like to echo the Chairman in welcoming the Ad Hoc Governor of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Dr Amir Hossein Zamaninia, to today’s meeting.

Allow me to also take a few minutes to recognize the Staff of the OPEC Secretariat for their dedication and forbearance in these exacting times.

Their conduct is a reflection of the strength and resilience of this great Organization. Not a day has gone by that our Staff have not carried out their duties, often from home while helping to care for their own families, and in compliance with the Austrian government’s instructions that OPEC has endorsed.

In a matter of weeks, with the tireless support of our Staff and Member Countries, we have held three Extraordinary Meetings (9-10 and 12 April), and participation in the G20 Energy Ministers (10 April) webinar.

Together with the non-OPEC participating countries in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, we have ushered in the largest stabilization effort in oil market history. There is no precedent in terms of the size and duration of the production adjustments that all the OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) have committed to undertake.

At the same time, preparations continue for the upcoming Economic Commission Board, the JTC, JMMC, OPEC Conference and OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

The regular work of this Organization never missed a beat. Two weeks ago, we released the Monthly Oil Market Report. In these extraordinary times, the MOMR is recognized more than ever as a go-to reference for the industry, journalists, analysts and many others.

Our Staff are also preparing for the release of the Annual Statistical Bulletin in June. In conjunction with our good friends in Baghdad, the planning continues for our 60th Anniversary celebrations in September. We are also preparing for the November release of the World Oil Outlook. I am certain that the 14th edition will be one of the most sought-after WOOs since it was first published in 2007.

During the past month, we have organized and hosted a series of virtual round-table briefings with select energy policymakers and experts from international institutions, consulting firms, the oil industry, the financial community and think tanks around the world. These roundtables also featured the European Commission; and oil consuming countries, such as China and India.

The discussions provided a productive and timely platform to exchange views on the historic outcomes of the Ministerial Meetings, the unparalleled economic and oil market conditions resulting from COVID-19, and the public health measures taken to control the pandemic.

Holding these energy roundtables has proven to be of enormous strategic importance by drawing on the expertise of leading analysts, scholars and economists. They have provided a deeper understanding of the market and conditions affecting it. As no individual stakeholder can have all the answers, it is only by reaching out and deepening dialogue between reputable institutions that can provide a better and broader sense of the rapidly evolving energy landscape.

These events, all held virtually from our Headquarters, have accomplished several pivotal objectives. These objectives include strengthening our messages of commitment to market stability beyond the short-term; enhancing understanding with major stakeholders; and enriching our knowledge of the interwoven complexities in such unprecedented times in an efficient and effective manner through outreach channels and a transparent communications strategy.

Let me also convey my gratitude to all the OPEC Member Countries for their support, and their solidarity, throughout this unparalleled international emergency.

It is also important to note that we have had exceptional cooperation from the Government of Austria throughout this crisis. We have an open and direct line of communication with the Austrian Government, including HE Alexander Schallenberg, the Foreign Minister. This has helped us to implement the local guidelines and ensure the safety of Staff and their families while maintaining uninterrupted services to our Member Countries.

The world has changed in many ways that we could not have imagined when this Board met at the end of October 2019. Let me briefly recap a few highlights since we last convened:

In December, our Member Countries – together with the other DoC participants – proactively adjusted production by 500,000 b/d to a then-record 1.7 mb/d. This decision demonstrated the resolve of all participating countries to ensure market stability and predictability going into a new year – and indeed a new decade.

But no one could have predicted the fast-moving situation that would transpire with COVID-19. In a very short time, a wave of shock and mounting uncertainty swept aside the hopeful start to the year.

At the 178th Extraordinary Meeting of the OPEC Conference on March 5th and 6th, the full market impact of COVID-19 was unclear. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) did not declare a public health pandemic until March 11th. Our meetings here in Vienna were held under difficult circumstances, with special precautions taken to protect the health of all delegates and OPEC Staff. All this was done in close consultation with the Austrian authorities.

Little did we know at the time that the epicentre of COVID-19 would make a dramatic shift from one continent to another, extending the economic destruction and oil market meltdown.

The human impact is truly staggering. The latest WHO data shows around 5.5 million confirmed cases worldwide and 350,000 lives lost. The epicentre of this terrible human tragedy is now shifting to Latin America, with North and South America combined accounting for 45% of cases and 42% of fatalities worldwide. The US and Brazil lead in the number of confirmed cases at the moment. Although declining infection rates have allowed the slow opening of economies in some regions, such as here in Europe, COVID-19 remains an ever-present danger to our human and economic well-being. All our Member Countries continue to battle this pandemic.

The global economic recession and oil market collapse we have witnessed in such a short time are unlike anything I have seen in my career.

Our latest MOMR projects that the world economy will shrink by 3.4% in 2020, following global economic growth of 2.9% in the previous year. This projection is in line with other leading international institutions.

We expect world oil demand growth to drop by a staggering 9.07 mb/d this year, with the worst impact in the second quarter. Demand for the year is likely to be around 90.59 mb/d – taking us back to levels we saw before the 2014-2016 market downturn.

We are also deeply concerned about what the current crisis means for investment in our industry and our countries. The market collapse has already pushed petroleum companies over the edge and poses an existential threat to others in the oil industry.

We now expect CAPEX in non-OPEC countries to plummet by 23% y-o-y in 2020, to about half the $741 billion record set in 2014. This puts highly skilled jobs, innovation and advances in efficiency at risk at a time when the industry – and the global economy – need them the most.

For our Member Countries, the current circumstances and financial setback will sharply curtail efforts to diversify, finance technological innovation, and invest in the energy transition.

As market conditions continued to deteriorate at the end of 1Q20 and the start of the second quarter, it became clear that urgent action was needed. Key stakeholders from around the world were lining up behind the DoC countries to support proactive, pre-emptive and decisive action to prevent a total market meltdown.

Action was needed, and act we did. The agreed production adjustments, totalling 9.7 mb/d for two months, followed by phased reductions in the adjustment levels over a further 22 months, were unparalleled in scope and duration. The two-year period for production adjustments demonstrated the full commitment of all stakeholders to achieve common goals.

Some OPEC Member Countries – led by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait – along with Oman have gone further with additional voluntary adjustments, totalling around 1.2 mb/d. These contributions reduce the risk of tank tops and offer fresh reassurance and confidence to the market.

This historic OPEC-led response is already helping to reduce volatility, stabilize the oil market, and to provide a platform for recovery and growth in the coming years. ‘Black Monday’, when West Texas Intermediate took a nosedive into negative territory for the first time ever on April 20th, now appears to be an anomaly.

Another pivotal outcome of the April meetings was the encouragement and outpouring of support the DoC participants received. In addition, we have seen commitments from independent producers, and engagement from the G20 and other international bodies, on the need for proactive and coordinated action to stabilize the world’s most important energy source. There are stakeholders in Canada, Norway, Colombia, Brazil and many other producing nations who have added their support to broader collaboration to stave off a further erosion of the market.

We continue to work closely with the International Energy Agency – including regular consultations – and International Energy Forum to ensure open lines of communication between producers and consumers. Together, we collaborate to ensure access to accurate, timely and transparent data about the markets.

The discussions held over the past few weeks have helped us gain a better understanding of the impact of this crisis on other actors. They have reinforced OPEC’s image as a leading force in achieving a stable and secure energy supply for the world. They have demonstrated again our desire to maintain the momentum in achieving broad and inclusive dialogue and cooperation.

Esteemed Members of the Board,

The challenges created by the COVID-19 tragedy will require special attention. I would like to point out that the exceptional circumstances we are encountering today reinforce the importance of the Organization to its Member Countries, and to the world at large.

Unfortunately, we have no crystal ball at our disposal to predict the future or alert us to unforeseen events like COVID-19. We are facing a new, more uncertain world – a new normal. In response, we need to position the Secretariat so it can maintain its leadership in providing fact-based assessments, timely data and strategic guidance going forward. We can and should seize the momentum recognizing the role and success of OPEC+ in the global oil market, and elevate it further to a platform of broader collaboration with longer-term perspectives.

As part of our 60th Anniversary celebration, the Secretariat will publish a book on the history of this esteemed Organization to date. It will chronicle the many great moments over the years – the challenges we have overcome through cooperation, and the opportunities we have embarked on through shared purpose and vision. It will be a timely reflection of six decades of OPEC history in the year of COVID-19.

I am confident that we will emerge from the current crisis more united, stronger and more forward-looking. Much of the credit goes to this Board and your efforts to create a more agile Organization – one that is in a strong position to respond to unforeseen challenges and market volatility.

I conclude by recalling the reassuring words of Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General who has ably led the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

“With solidarity, humility and assuming the best of each other, we can – and will – overcome this together.”

Thank you. I now turn the floor back to the Chairman.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/63-28-may-2020.html"
"2020-04-16","The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would like to update the distinguished delegates to the International Monetary and Finance Committee (IMFC) on current oil market conditions and developments.

The global oil market showed relative stability and ended 2019 on a positive note, despite economic headwinds and high uncertainties regarding ongoing trade disputes, Brexit and geopolitical developments throughout the year. At the beginning of 2020, there were signals that the economy would rebound from the slowdown in the second half of the previous year, with global economic activity, including global trade and industrial production, expected to pick up. Furthermore, despite strong growth in non-OPEC production, the global oil market remained well balanced, owing to the strong conformity of OPEC and participating non-OPEC producing countries in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) of an exceptionally high 145% in 2019, which played a major role in improving oil market conditions and market stability.

However, instead of the expected pick-up in activity in 2020, the global economy and, consequently, the global oil market were drawn into one of the most severe crises in recent history, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries around the world have virtually shut down, imposing travel restrictions and mandating social-distancing measures in an effort to contain the pandemic. These measures have not only severely affected global economic growth, they have also caused a historic demand shock in the oil market, which has led to extreme volatility in oil prices. Concerns about this grave oil market imbalance, which would inevitably lead to massive global oil stock overhangs in coming months, led to oil prices dropping significantly in late March to below $20/b, the lowest level in nearly 18 years. Oil prices lost about two-thirds of their value over 1Q20.

Given current market conditions and the massive oil demand destruction so far, OPEC, together with other producing countries participating in the DoC, held an Extraordinary Ministerial Meeting on 9 April 2020 to address the huge market volatility and fast growing global oil imbalance, taking an immediate decision to avoid further deterioration in the market. The agreement to once again adjust production is expected to be implemented as of 1 May, necessitating a further revision of the non-OPEC supply and supply/demand balance outlook for the rest of the year in the days and weeks to come. Furthermore, the Meeting welcomed the strong support of other producing countries and states participating in the Meeting to make voluntary contributions and called for comprehensive international cooperation to stabilize the global oil market and prevent extensive and lasting damage to the oil industry.

Following global economic growth of 2.9% in 2019, the world economy is forecast to face a severe recession in 2020, declining by 1.1%. Despite slight signs of improvement at the beginning of the year, expectations for global economic growth were burdened by the carry-over of weak 4Q19 data in several key economies, which has been significantly worsened by the strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic developments in these times of COVID-19 are proving to be unique. Contrary to comparable economic shocks, the global economy is witnessing a combination of a supply and a demand shock, together with severe disruption in the financial markets. Moreover, the impact of COVID-19 is exacerbated by high global debt levels, the ongoing general slowdown in world trade, as well as challenges in manufacturing caused by slowing capital expenditure in some key economies and by the global deceleration of the automotive industry. The underlying key assumption for the 2020 GDP growth forecast is that the impact of COVID-19 related developments outside China will be felt most in 2Q20, when world GDP is expected to contract by at least 8%.

Therefore, most regions are forecast to see a slowdown through 2Q20, recovering only towards the second half of 3Q20. China’s trajectory is forecast to see a sharp deceleration in 1Q20, and to a lesser extent in 2Q20, before recovering in 2H20. By 4Q20, global activity is assumed to have almost normalized. Nevertheless, depending on future developments, further downside risk remains.

Positively, the sharp downturn is counter-balanced by unprecedented government-led stimulus measures designed to offset the negative economic consequences. Based on OPEC Secretariat estimates, the global stimulus measures in the form of fiscal and monetary stimulus, including guarantees, amount to around $15 trillion, or about 17% of global GDP, and constitute the largest stimulus efforts ever undertaken.

Importantly, the fast growing imbalance in oil markets is also taking a significant toll on global economic growth. Therefore, a recovery in the oil sector may provide further support to global economic development.

Within the OECD group of countries, the US is forecast to experience a strong contraction in 2Q20, following a lesser decline in 1Q20. While the considerable fiscal and monetary stimulus measures will provide a good base for recovery in 2H20, growth is forecast to decline by 3.5% in 2020, following growth of 2.3% in 2019. An even larger decline is seen in the Euro-zone, where economic activity is forecast to fall by 6.0% in 2020, compared to growth of 1.2% in 2019. Following a largely declining Euro-zone economy in 1H20, fiscal and monetary measures are expected to support a recovery in 2H20. Japan is forecast to decline by 3.3% in 2020, compared to growth of 0.7% in 2019. After the government’s sales tax increase in 4Q19, the economy experienced negative growth in 4Q19 and now faces additional rising challenges amid the COVID-19 crisis. A stimulus package of up to 20% of Japan’s GDP will counterbalance some of the downside in 1H20 and support growth in 2H20.

COVID-19 is also expected to take its toll on emerging markets. While China has been particularly affected since the beginning of the year, the situation now seems to be under control. Following growth of 6.1% in 2019, Chinas’ 2020 GDP is forecast to grow by 1.5%, mainly due to a sharp contraction in 1Q20. A tender recovery should materialize in 2Q20, before the rebound accelerates in 2H20. While India was less impacted during the first two months of the year, the negative economic impact of COVID-19 will increase going into 2Q20. With a recovery forecast in 2H20, growth in 2020 is forecast at 2.7%. Similarly in Brazil, economic growth is forecast to show a significant contraction in 1H20, with some recovery in 2H20 leading to a y-o-y decline of 1.6% in 2020. Russia’s economy is forecast to decline by 0.3% in 2020, not only due to COVID-19, but also because of the considerable decline in oil prices. Depending on near-term developments in the oil market, the Russian economy is forecast to recover in 2H20 after an expected considerable contraction in the first two quarters of the year.

World oil demand in 2019 grew by a lower-than-expected 0.83 mb/d. Both the OECD and non-OECD regions saw weaker y-o-y growth due to softer economic growth in 1H19, as well as warmer weather in the Northern Hemisphere in 4Q19.

In stark contrast to earlier expectations, global oil demand in 2020 is now forecast to fall by as much as 6.8 mb/d y-o-y, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on transportation and industrial fuels. Oil demand is expected to suffer the most in the first half of the year and shrink by more than 10 mb/d before recovering somewhat in 2H20.

In OECD Americas, oil demand in 2020 is projected to drop significantly y-o-y. Government measures to reduce the spread of the pandemic are expected to have a significant negative impact on transportation fuels, particularly gasoline. In OECD Europe, oil demand is also projected to decline, especially for transportation and industrial fuels, with jet fuel experiencing the largest impact. In OECD Asia Pacific, contracting y-o-y oil demand in both Japan and South Korea is expected to be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 in 1Q20. Similar to OECD Europe, demand for transportation and industrial fuels, including petrochemical feedstock, will suffer particularly in 1H20, with some improvement anticipated in 2H20. Nevertheless, overall demand is expected to be deeply in the negative. Jet fuel is forecast to be significantly hit in 2020, along with diesel and fuel oil, in light of reduced economic activity.

In the non-OECD, oil demand growth in China is forecast to show a
y-o-y decline. Jet fuel demand was affected in 1Q20 because of reduced air travel, while gasoline will be impacted by a decline in kilometres driven. Industrial fuels and petrochemical feedstock will also face serious challenges going forward, with growth very much dependent on the extent of the rebound during 2H20. In Other Asia, oil demand is also projected to decline y-o-y, with the transportation and industrial sectors projected to be impacted the most due to government measures to prevent the spread of the pandemic. In Latin America, growth in oil demand is also forecast to be slower y-o-y, driven by an expected slowdown in economic growth and the impact of COVID-19. Industrial fuels, led by diesel, are projected to decline, followed by transportation fuels, particularly gasoline. In the Middle East, oil demand is projected to contract y-o-y in 2020, mainly as a result of slower economic expectations and the restrictions placed on individual mobility in an attempt to contain COVID-19.

In 2019, non-OPEC liquids supply (including processing gains) is estimated to have grown by 1.99 mb/d y-o-y. The US, Brazil, Canada, Russia, Australia and China were the main growth drivers, while Mexico and Norway saw the largest declines. Though non-OPEC supply in 2019 was challenged by infrastructure constraints in Texas and Alberta, growth was supported by production ramp ups in Brazil, Australia and the new giant oil field in Norway in 4Q19.

For 2020, COVID-19, the ensuing global economic recession and oil demand destruction are forecast to impact world oil supply substantially. Oil companies have announced reductions in planned capital expenditure amid sharp declines in oil price levels. Global E&P spending for 2020 is forecast to drop by 20% and is now estimated at $450 billion, the lowest level in 13 years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, upstream investment was expected to remain flat y-o-y. Non-OPEC liquids supply (including processing gains) for 2020 was revised lower by around 1.6 mb/d from previous estimations and was expected to grow by 0.16 mb/d. These numbers, however, will require further revisions as the outcome of the recent meeting and decision unfolds and begin to take effect. Given the fluidity of ongoing developments, the non-OPEC supply forecast for 2020 faces a large amount of uncertainty, mainly with regard to oil demand, oil price levels and spending by E&P companies.

Meanwhile, OPEC NGLs and non-conventional liquids are estimated to have grown by 0.04 mb/d in 2019, to average 4.79 mb/d, and are forecast to grow by 0.04 mb/d in 2020 to average 4.83 mb/d. In March 2020, OPEC crude oil production increased by 843 tb/d to average 28.62 mb/d, according to secondary sources.

OECD commercial oil stocks rose by 5.6 mb m-o-m in February 2020 to stand at 2,945 mb. This was 64.3 mb higher than the same time one year ago and 24.7 mb above the latest five-year average. Within the components, crude stocks fell by 6.1 mb, while product stocks rose by 11.7 mb m-o-m.

In closing, OPEC would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm its long-standing commitment to supporting oil market stability for the mutual benefit of consuming and producing nations, thus contributing significantly to the health of the global economy. The historic success of the Declaration of Cooperation has underscored the Organization’s leadership in ensuring a stable and constructive environment in which future energy requirements can be met. Given the current global crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for international coordination has become ever more apparent. OPEC reiterates its commitment to spearhead the joint efforts in re-establishing healthy oil market fundamentals and restoring balance to the oil market in support of the global economy.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/65-16-april-2020.html"
"2020-04-12","Excellencies,

I cannot overstate the fact that this is a critical juncture for the talks between OPEC and non-OPEC countries participating in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

The people whose lives depend on this vital industry, many of whom work in our home countries, are waiting on us; the entire oil sector is expectant; the whole world is watching us.

On Thursday and Friday last week, we took the responsive and responsible action to focus on adjusting crude oil production by 10 mb/d beginning on 1 May 2020, for an initial period of two months; then by 8 mb/d from July to December 2020; and by 6 mb/d for the period of January 2021 to April 2022, in the interests of producers, consumers, and the global economy.

It can only be described as an historic meeting, and it built momentum for support at the G20 Extraordinary Energy Ministers Meeting on April 10, with both producers and consumers participating.

This was forthcoming in the statement from the G20 meeting with a commitment to work together “in the spirit of solidarity”. It also recognized the commitment of the producers in the OPEC+ group to stabilize energy markets and acknowledged the importance of international cooperation in ensuring the resilience of energy systems.

Now we need to ensure as a group that we deliver on these expectations. We need to iron out any marginal differences to reach a consensus decision. We need to get this deal over the line.

The consequences of not finding a solution and unanimity today do not bear thinking about.

The markets will react with a bearish ferocity when they open on Monday. We will all bear witness to uncontrolled chaos.

It was the great, principled and courageous Nelson Mandela, who once said:

""Difficulties break some but make others. No axe is sharp enough to cut the soul of a sinner who keeps on trying, one armed with the hope that he will rise even in the end.""

We need to channel this sentiment. We need to take the lead.

The multi-faceted challenges thrown up by the unparalleled COVID-19 pandemic, need comprehensive and ‘global’ solutions.

I am optimistic that we can seal this deal, with unity and courage for the common cause of oil market stability, in the interests of all stakeholders.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/66-12-april-2020.html"
"2020-04-10","Excellencies,

I would like to begin by thanking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, led wisely, astutely and courageously by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud; Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud; and my friend HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, the Minister of Energy, for convening this Extraordinary G20 Energy Ministers Meeting today.

This meeting is timely, being held back-to-back with our OPEC+ meeting yesterday.

We are living in unprecedented times. When the year 2020 began no-one could have dreamt up the situation we find ourselves in today.

The COVID-19 pandemic has pervaded almost every aspect of our daily lives. It is a major disruptor in terms of the tragic loss of life; it has forced governments into widespread lockdowns; economies are in distress; schools have closed; and we are holding meetings like this one via teleconference.

Every economic sector has been impacted by this silent beast. This is clearly evident in global oil. Every producer, many of whom are developing nations, has been impacted; no-one is immune.

It is forcing us to assess and reassess what the consequences are on an almost daily basis. We need to find solutions to help all peoples of the world, the industry and related businesses, as we try and navigate these extraordinary times.

This was evident in the responsive and responsible decision taken yesterday by OPEC and participating countries in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ to adjust crude oil production by 10 mb/d beginning on 1 May 2020, for an initial period of two months; then by 8 mb/d from July to December 2020; and by 6 mb/d for the period of January 2021 to April 2022, in the interests of producers, consumers, and the global economy.

May I, on behalf of the Conference, congratulate the Chairman, HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, for the astute leadership he displayed in managing the (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting yesterday (9 April).

Together with his co-chair, HE Alexander Novak of the Russian Federation, they successfully managed one of the longest and probably the most historic conferences in the history of OPEC.

The success of this historic agreement depends on the full and timely participation of all producers. Everyone has a responsibility to play their part. The sustained stability of the global oil market is a shared responsibility.

We, therefore, need to broaden this cooperation and welcome the support of others. Complex challenges, need comprehensive and ‘global’ solutions, under your able leadership Mr Chairman.

This is starkly apparent when we look at the harrowing global recession now upon us, and the oil demand destruction we are facing.

[Slide 3]

We see global GDP growth in 2020 at a negative 1.1%, a greater contraction than that for the Great Recession of 2008-2009, and global oil demand growth is forecast to drop by 6.8 mb/d, with the second quarter alone around 12 mb/d, and expanding.

[Slide 4]

These are jaw-dropping numbers!

The jaw drops even further when we look at the supply and demand imbalance in the 2Q20, if no action is taken.

[Slide 5]

There could be a colossal excess volume of 14.7 mb/d, which would add a further 1.3 billion barrels to global crude oil stocks. This figures suggests that the available global crude oil storage capacity would be exhausted before the end of May.

There is a ghostly spectre encircling the oil industry; it needs to be addressed urgently. We need to act now, so we can come out of other side of this pandemic with the strength of our industry intact. An industry that has fueled the current civilization.

We welcome the importance that the G20 attaches to oil market stability. We also appreciate that many G20 Members are large consumers of oil.

In this regard, we need to appreciate that any shortfall in investments in the coming year could sow the seeds for future energy security issues in the years ahead. It is in all of our interests to support stability in this vital global industry.

I commend my colleague, Fatih Birol, in his role as Executive Director of the IEA, for his tireless work over the past few weeks in dialoguing with both producers and consumers.

As I mentioned in my remarks yesterday to the 9th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting: we need to dare to believe and cooperate with each other.

There is a huge historic challenge before us, but I firmly believe that is not insurmountable if we work together in solidarity and courage for the common cause of market stability.

It was Eleanor Roosevelt that once said:

“Courage is more exhilarating than fear, and in the long run it is easier. We do not have to become heroes overnight. Just a step at a time, meeting each thing that comes up, seeing it is not as dreadful as it appeared, discovering we have the strength to stare it down.”

As an industry, we can stare down the situation we face through the enduring timelessness of the principles and key tenets of international cooperation.

These can help guide us through these dark days.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/67-10-april-2020.html"
"2020-04-09","Your Royal Highness,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,

It is my pleasure to welcome all Heads of Delegation to this 9th (Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

We are in the midst of a human tragedy on a scale perhaps not seen since more than a century. The pandemic has reached almost every corner of the planet.

People are suffering, and especially the poorest ones. Our hearts are pierced by the images of makeshift hospitals around the world that have been built to cope with the mounting number of patients.

We pray for all those adversely impacted by this crisis – may they receive healing and comfort in their time of need.

In addition to the human toll, this crisis has inflicted major damage on the world economy and, by extension, the global oil market.

Since our last meeting in March, the Covid-19 pandemic has proliferated around the world, slowly and steadily paralyzing the global economy. Countries and citizens around the world are suffering the consequences of the economic impacts.

The impact on the oil market is also unprecedented. Large-scale oil demand destruction, and the resulting massive supply and demand imbalance, have the potential to fill global storage capacity quickly and force production shutdowns. The adverse impact on oil exporting country revenues is huge, at a time when these countries are facing the human tragedy of the pandemic and the resulting economic downturn.

Excellencies,

We are at a critical turning point, where action is required. The oil market is in an unsustainable freefall. This emergency meeting shall be an opportunity for decisive and immediate action.

The world’s eyes are on this large gathering of producers to provide visionary leadership at a time of crisis. Our meeting here today sends a clear message to the global market that we are taking this situation seriously and moving forward proactively and responsibly to find constructive, effective and credible solutions to rebalance the global oil market.

This is a historical meeting. It is an opportunity for multilateral collaboration, flexibility and inclusiveness, in these challenging times.

We must act today quickly and decisively, in firm solidarity and unity, in the interests of producers, consumers, the global economy and future generations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/68-9-april-2020.html"
"2020-04-09","Excellencies,

Over the course of the last few months, COVID-19 has pervaded almost every aspect of life. We see it in the lockdowns initiated by governments across the world; the widespread travel restrictions; business and industry shutdowns; school closures; social distancing measures … I could go on.

Covid-19 is an unseen beast that seems to be impacting everything in its path. First and foremost this comes in the tragic loss of life; our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected.

There are also no sectors of the economy unaffected by this unprecedented situation.

For the oil market, it has completely up-ended market supply and demand fundamentals since we last met on 6 March.

Even in the first week of March the outlook looked relatively bleak, but in just over one month it has changed beyond all recognition. The supply and demand fundamentals are horrifying; the expected excess supply volumes on the market, particularly in the 2Q20, are beyond anything we have seen before.

Our industry is hemorrhaging; no-one has been able to stem the bleeding. We are already seeing some productions shut-ins, companies filing for bankruptcy and tens of thousands of jobs are being lost.

The data and analysis presented and deliberated on today, underscores the scale of the massive challenge before us.

Only one month ago at the meetings in Vienna, expected 2020 global GDP growth was 2.4%. Today, it is a negative 1.1%. It is incredible to think that the global contraction is far greater than that for the Great Recession of 2008-2009.

In early March, expected 2020 global oil demand growth was just below 0.1 mb/d. Today, we are looking at a contraction of 6.8 mb/d, with the second quarter alone close to 12 mb/d and expanding. These are staggering numbers! Unprecedented in modern times.

The outlook for non-OPEC supply growth in 2020 has also fallen by over 1.5 mb/d, although this is nowhere near the drop for oil demand.

The OPEC Reference Basket has fallen from $52.7/b in March 2020 to below $20/b in early April, a decline of around 70%. We are all now seeing significant less revenue coming into our treasuries.

This evidently has major consequences, with the limits of the market being tested on many fronts.

We are likely to see further breaches in logistical capacity, for ships, pipelines, terminals and processing units. And it is clear that available storage capacity is quickly filling up.

To put this in some context, the OPEC Secretariat’s assessment of available global oil storage capacity stands over one billion barrels. Given the current unprecedented supply and demand imbalance there could be a colossal excess volume of 14.7 mb/d in the 2Q20. This oversupply would add a further 1.3 billion barrels to global crude oil stocks, and hence exhaust the available global crude oil storage capacity within the month of May.

There is a grizzly shadow hanging over all of us. We do not want this shadow to envelope us. It will have a crushing and long-term impact on the entire industry.

It is not just oil – the situation is negatively impacting all commodities; metals; minerals; stocks and financial markets.

All the producers here, OPEC, OPEC+ and other producing nations that have taken it upon them to responsibly join the meeting today, need to recall the severe market imbalance 2014-2016. It was when oil producers lost trillions of dollars in foregone revenues, and globally more than $1 trillion was lost in terms of investment.

It is imperative we take urgent action. It is in all of our interests, and it is also in the interests of consumers. That is not to say that any medicine will be easy; obviously, it won’t. But it is clear that it is needed. And it will benefit us all.

These difficult times require unparalleled flexibility and commitment.

Commitment and shared responsibility is part and parcel of the history of the DoC partners. We have always been proactive and proportional; responsible and responsive; thorough and thoughtful.

I call on oil producers here today, to look at the market outlook we present, and stand shoulder-to-shoulder to help this vital global industry survive. For the current quarter, around 15% of global oil consumption has evaporated and this huge market imbalance needs to be urgently addressed.

I would like to leave you with a line from the great Bard, William Shakespeare:

“Let me embrace thee, sour adversity, for wise men say it is the wisest course.”

With the huge challenge before us, and in this increasingly complex and interdependent world, we count on the spirit of togetherness and the enduring timelessness of the principles of international cooperation driven by inclusiveness and mutual respect among all nations gathered today to guide us through these demanding period.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/69-9-april-2020.html"
"2020-02-26","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning to you all. It is a great pleasure to be here in Riyadh for this International Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Conference, which is being held under the esteemed patronage of HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, Minister of Energy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and HE Shaikh Mohamed Bin Khalifa Al Khalifa, Minister of Oil of the Kingdom of Bahrain.

Excellencies, allow me to thank you for the invitation to be part of this important event, which will tackle the theme of Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage in Climate and Energy Strategies. I commend you both for organizing this Conference, the timing of which could not be more crucial and the content of which is of utmost importance for the future of the oil and gas industry.

As many of you are well aware, OPEC is dedicated to identifying balanced, equitable, inclusive and common sense solutions to the challenges posed by climate change.

We believe that the oil and gas industry can and must be part of the solution to climate change. The science is clear on the gravity of this issue, and we are actively engaged in multilateral processes that aim to address this global challenge.

Yes, greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced, but we must not place ourselves in a position where we are forced to choose one energy type over another. The fact is, with a global population estimated to increase by 1.6 billion – from 7.6 billion in 2018 to 9.2 billion in 2040 – the world will require all energy types to meet rising energy demand in the long term.

With this in mind, the focus must be on developing and implementing cleaner energy technologies across the value chain, enabling us to meet the world’s burgeoning energy needs in a sustainable and efficient manner.

In doing so, however, we must be inclusive and equitable in our decisions, and not forget our fellow citizens who, day in and day out, struggle for access to energy the rest of the world takes for granted. Here, I am referring to the serious scourge of energy poverty. The facts are sobering: there are more than 800 million people around the world who lack access to electricity and almost three billion who live without modern fuels for clean cooking.

Let me be clear: nobody should be left behind in the energy transition. Sustainable Development Goal number seven of the United Nations ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all people – not just for a select group.

OPEC is a co-author of the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement and fully supports the multilateral approach to addressing climate change. The core elements of the UNFCCC, particularly equity, historical responsibility and national circumstances must be considered at all junctures moving forward.

Energy poverty and climate change are two sides of the same coin. Thus, it is our firm belief that a well-coordinated and balanced approach with the participation of global stakeholders across the value chain will be essential to effectively addressing the complex issue of climate change while also meeting the unique energy requirements of those in developing nations.

Excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

This Conference has brought together world energy leaders from both the public and private sectors as well as industry experts, policymakers and scientists to deliberate ways in which CCUS might contribute to the establishment of a circular carbon economy. This type of economy would enable this industry to combat climate change through the recovery and recycling of carbon emissions. Engaging and informative discussions on this topic already took place in yesterday’s dedicated session entitled “CCUS and Circular Carbon Economy.”

I must commend the efforts of Saudi Arabia, which is a leading advocate for harnessing technology to address climate change. This was evident at last October’s Future Investment Initiative here in Riyadh, when HRH Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman gave a prolific speech outlining Saudi Arabia’s transformative efforts. We published this speech in the OPEC Bulletin. If I may, your Highness, I would like to share an excerpt: “For us, transformation begins from within. The Kingdom is putting its resources behind the Circular Carbon Economy by investing heavily in new energy and efficiency solutions for the world. In fact, Saudi Arabia is reforming its entire energy ecosystem.”

This Conference on CCUS is just another indication of the pivotal role this technology will play in the years to come as an innovative and cost-effective solution to addressing climate change.

According to the Global CCS Institute, CCUS is one of the few technologies that is able to adequately displace CO2 from coal and gas-fired power stations and the only technology capable of decreasing large-scale emissions from diverse industrial sources. It is also a technology that can be retrofitted to many existing facilities, enabling them to operate cleanly for the remainder of their lifecycles. CCUS is also beginning to prove itself as a commercially viable solution, and is thus seen as a win-win proposal for many industry players.

As of 2019, there were an estimated 51 large-scale CCS facilities around the world. These include 19 that are operational, four that are under construction and 28 that in are various stages of development. Geographically, these facilities are located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and in the Asia Pacific region.

The total capture and storage capacity has risen by 34% since 2017, which equals 97.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year. To date, more than 260 million tonnes of anthropogenic CO2 have been safely captured and permanently stored globally.

According to the IEA’s most recent report on CCUS, three-quarters of the CO2 captured today in large-scale facilities comes from oil and gas operations, and the industry accounts for more than one-third of overall spending on CCUS projects.

OPEC and its Member Countries are joined by the IPCC, the IEA, international oil companies and many other industry leaders in highlighting the critical role that CCUS must play in meeting global emissions reduction goals.

Several OPEC Member Countries have been active in CCUS projects, and I would like to briefly highlight some of their impressive endeavours. Some of these country-specific projects will be further elaborated upon in various sessions today.

First of all, right here in Saudi Arabia, the Uthmaniyah demonstration project in the Eastern Province of the country was launched in 2015 with the goal of capturing 0.8 million tonnes per year of CO2 at the Hawiyah natural gas processing plant and transporting it 85 kilometers by pipeline to the depleted Uthmaniyah area of the Ghawar field. The project is run by Saudi Aramco, which describes it as “one of the Middle East’s largest CO2 capture and storage demonstration projects.” The plant has the capability to capture and process an impressive 45 million standard cubic feet of CO2 per day.

In the United Arab Emirates, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company has ambitious plans to increase its carbon capture programme six-fold by using Enhanced Oil Recovery technology at its maturing fields. The company’s commercial-scale Al Reyadah facility has the capacity to capture 800,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. ADNOC’s goal is to increase this capacity six-fold to reach 5 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2030.

In the Islamic Republic of Iran, we also see great progress being made with CCUS. The massive AMAK project, which is the country’s largest gas gathering and treatment project, averts the flaring of around 180 million cubic feet of gas per day, dehydrates it, injects into the pipeline and, finally, it is processed for further consumption.

Since 2004, Algeria has also been a pioneer in CCUS with its cutting-edge In Salah project. The Krechba gas treatment plant, located about 1,200 kilometers south of Algiers, successfully stores CO2 in analogous carboniferous sandstone wells.

There are also significant opportunities for Angola and Equatorial Guinea to employ CCUS in their depleted oil and gas fields, and Angola has the added CCUS opportunities using its deep saline aquifers.

These are just a few of the examples of the excellent efforts being made in OPEC countries to reduce their carbon footprints and increase their operational efficiencies while also diversifying their economies.

In the private sector, action is also being taken by international corporations, which have stepped up their efforts to address climate change.

At the beginning of this year, Microsoft announced its lofty aims to go carbon negative by 2030. This means the company would remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than it emits. Over and above this, by 2050, it has pledged to reach an even higher target of removing from the environment all of the carbon the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975.

As part of these ambitious plans, the company announced a new four-year, $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund to help, as the company describes it, “stimulate and accelerate the development of carbon removal technology”. A portion of these funds will be devoted to further developing and refining CCUS technologies, helping advance the overall CCUS industry and accelerate efforts towards reaching the broader climate goals.

International oil companies are also introducing proactive measures. Just two weeks ago, BP released its goals to become a net-zero company by 2050. These ambitious targets include net zero emissions across the company’s operations, net zero carbon in its oil and gas production, as well as a 50% cut in carbon intensity of its products. To achieve this, the company will fundamentally transform its organization and the way it does business.

On the policy front, CCUS is seen as an integral part of any strategy to limit global warming and meet the temperature target of well below 2 degrees celsius in line with the Paris Agreement’s long-term goal.

Industrialized countries are putting this option on the table as a means of meeting their mitigation contributions. For example, the European Union has defined CCUS as one of seven technological tools to reach the goal on climate neutrality by 2050. And last week, the New York Times published an article entitled “The Republican Climate Agenda” which elaborates the new US House Republican climate agenda, which calls for tax breaks to encourage the development of technology for CCUS from coal and gas plants.

So, clearly, we are seeing positive momentum for the growth and support of CCUS, however there are still some hurdles to be overcome going forward.

Article 6 of the Paris Agreement remained an unresolved issue from COP24 in Katowice, and was then placed on the agenda for COP25 in Madrid. One of the concerns is in paragraph 4 of Article 6 on the transition of activities from the Kyoto Protocol and provisions for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) activities. There is a need to ensure that CCUS projects would be eligible for the new mechanisms created under Article 6.4.

On the margins of COP25, discussions also took place on the governance, regulatory frameworks, technical aspects and socioeconomic value of CCUS and CO2 removal.

Looking ahead to COP26 in November of this year to be held in Glasgow, what some are calling a “grand coalition” is being developed to help bring together stakeholders from across the industry to enhance synergies and build consensus on the importance of leveraging all viable technologies, especially CCUS, to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

These developments point to the dire need for ongoing promotion of CCUS in all multilateral platforms. Indeed, this will be crucial to securing the future growth of this technology.

Another challenge will be to ensure adequate financing of CCUS projects. Experts estimate that approximately 2,000 large-scale facilities are required to meet global emissions reduction targets by 2040. This equates to hundreds of billions of dollars in required investments.

According to the latest IEA study on CCUS, 35% of overall CCUS capital expenditures, often backed by public funding, have been allocated to oil and gas companies. These include recent commissions for projects related to Chevron, CNPC, and Shell.

To date, the majority of funding comes from the public sector, so it will be crucial going forward for private sector financing to be significantly enhanced to ensure the large-scale deployment of CCUS. In this regard, members of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative recently announced their plans to launch a new initiative to attract large-scale CCUS investment at industrial hubs around the world. This financing would logically extend to public-private partnerships aimed at the development of innovative solutions for CCUS.

Finally, a word on the Green Climate Fund, which was set up in 2010 by the UNFCCC as the world’s largest dedicated fund helping developing countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions; We hope this important Fund will make CCUS an integral part of their project portfolio for mitigation efforts in the years to come.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

OPEC is fully supportive of CCUS and any other technological solution that will help mitigate the effects of climate change. However, I do think it is important that we do not get caught up in the false narratives of the prophets of doom — those that say the oil industry is on its last lap, and that peak oil is upon us.

We need to understand that the scale and complexity of climate challenge means that no single energy source can solve the problem.

The fact is, the oil and gas industry − with its extensive know-how and deep technological expertise − is uniquely positioned to be a solutions-provider in our common goals of reducing the environmental footprint. And indeed, as I have touched on earlier, great steps are already being made to provide clean energy technologies and greatly improved fuel efficiency standards.

Of course, more can be done, and more will be done, but it will be key that our industry’s capacity for technological innovation be fully leveraged within this process.

OPEC, its non-OPEC partners of the Declaration and Charter of Cooperation, along with the entire global oil industry, will have a role to play in providing viable and effective solutions for a sustainable energy future.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In September of this year, OPEC will celebrate its 60th Anniversary with a special commemorative ceremony to be held in Baghdad, Iraq, the sacred birthplace of the Organization.

In preparing for this landmark occasion, it has been a year of reflecting back on all that has been achieved. At the same time, we must continue to look forward and prepare for what lies ahead. In doing so, one main priority will be to successfully meet the world’s future energy needs in a sustainable and fair manner. This will be vitally important for the future we are building for our children and our childrens’ children.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/70-26-february-2020.html"
"2020-02-25","Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the International Carbon Capture and Utilization Conference here in Riyadh, the first of its kind held in the Middle East. This two-day event is a landmark gathering on a topic of critical importance to the Kingdom and the entire world, and it is wonderful to see such a large number of distinguished participants.

My friends, although the task of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions is challenging, we are not starting from scratch. Past work in this area has been considerable, and we should applaud those efforts, acknowledge the benefits they have achieved over the years, and seek to build on their foundation.

However, we must also recognize that the current scope, scale and speed of such efforts will not be sufficient for the global community to address the issue of climate change, or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the levels that must be achieved in the desired time frame.

We must also acknowledge that while alternative energy sources are expanding, the world continues to rely upon fossil fuels for the overwhelming share of its overall energy needs—a situation that will not change for many decades to come. At the same time, the world’s total energy demand will continue to grow, given our planet’s increasing population and rising living standards in the developing world.

Given that energy is a key input for both economic and social development, we also need to develop and deploy energy solutions that effectively address the problem of greenhouse gas emissions while also powering prosperity now and in the future.

Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we must accelerate the adoption of high-impact solutions such as Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage—and do so urgently.

I strongly believe that CCUS can and will serve as a cornerstone for the global energy and environmental systems of tomorrow, because it is a tried and tested technology today. Far from being a “magic bullet” solution that exists only as a concept, a lab-bench prototype, or a pilot demonstration program, CCUS is already making a positive difference, and is ready to be deployed at a greater scale.

At the same time, the considerable progress that continues to be made in the research, development, demonstration and global deployment of CCUS is extremely encouraging, and underscores the tremendous future promise of this proven technology.

That’s important, because according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, our global climate goals may not be achieved without utilizing CCS—in part because there are entire sectors such as cement, steel and chemicals where alternative, non-carbon options don’t exist in the way they do for power generation. CCUS, though, has the capacity to reduce emissions across various sectors, can be tied in with the increasing focus on hydrogen, and just as importantly is able to transform carbon into a useful, economically beneficial commodity.

In fact, CCUS really comes into its own as part of a much broader Circular Carbon Economy concept, which will be at the forefront of Saudi Arabia’s Presidency of the G20 this year. The Circular Carbon Economy serves as a platform to address energy issues in a holistic and inclusive manner—and CCUS plays a central role in this approach.

The 4Rs of the Circular Carbon Economy

So, as you can see, CCUS is front and center in two of the four Rs—making its accelerated and expanded adoption even more vital, since it is the linchpin of a much larger effort to reduce and redirect carbon emissions. And again, let me stress that within the Circular Carbon Economy framework, CCUS will deliver economic as well as environmental benefits, helping us to achieve objectives in both areas concurrently.

For its part, the Kingdom is already investing in the development of new technology for clean energy solutions including utilization of CCUS.

Some of those investments are already in place, and are making a tangible difference. For example, Saudi Aramco demonstrated the Gulf region’s first world-scale CO2 enhanced oil recovery project in 2015, which captures 800,000 tons of CO2 annually, while SABIC built one of the world’s largest CO2 capture and purification plants to provide carbon dioxide as a feedstock for chemicals, using 500,000 tons of CO2 per year.

And of course, for some four decades the Kingdom’s Master Gas System has been capturing gas that was once flared and turning it into a valuable, clean fuel and feedstock and making it the foundation of an entirely new domestic industrial sector. The economic and environmental benefits have been enormous, and the Master Gas System continues to serve as proof-of-concept when it comes to integrating economic viability with environmental protection.

The Kingdom is also an active and responsible member of the international community in various climate change initiatives. In 2015, the Kingdom joined the “Mission Innovation” and the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), co-leading the CCUS challenge with the United Kingdom and Mexico. That same year, the Kingdom joined the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), where the Kingdom co-led the CCUS initiative with United States, the United Kingdom and Norway.

Now, the time has come for all of us to redouble our efforts in the area of CCUS—which is what brings us together today. Without a doubt, technology development will play a pivotal role in finding effective solutions to the carbon emissions challenge, as well as supplying clean fuels and creating valuable feedstocks and ultimately useful products. But for those CCUS technologies and systems to be sustainable and quickly scalable, we must work together to create opportunities and remove barriers for private sector investment.

That means working together to drive down the costs and aggressively accelerate the pace of implementing CCUS at a global scale, including the construction of necessary infrastructure. At the same time, we need to look ahead to collectively identify new commercial models and strategies that will enable the research, development and deployment of the next generation of CCUS technology. And we need to encourage greater cooperation and collaboration among various countries, industries, R&D disciplines, and the public and private sectors.

None of that will be easy, none of that will be simple, and none of that is assured of ultimate success—but all of it is vital for our countries and our communities. Teddy Roosevelt once wrote, “Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, [and] difficulty.” There can be no doubt that CCUS is worth doing, and I strongly believe that collectively we have the clarity of vision, the technological capability, and the depth of determination required to meet the carbon emissions challenge, and to realize the full potential of Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/71-25-february-2020.html"
"2019-12-10","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Buenos tardes.

Thank you to our hosts for their gracious hospitality and to Minister Carolina Schmidt for valiantly managing the Presidency of COP 25.

I grew up in Yola, Adamawa State, Nigeria. There, even today, keeping the lights on in our houses, insulating our homes or accessing clean water ̶ amenities taken for granted by many countries ̶ are beyond the reach of the most vulnerable in our communities.

Sadly, this is a situation experienced in many developing countries.

The almost one billion people worldwide who currently lack access to electricity and the three billion without modern fuels for cooking are not just statistics on a page. They are real people. Each one is an individual.

Fuel poverty is not an abstract concept; rather it is a profound challenge for sustainable development. It is an all-too brutal reality for hungry families living in the cold or dark, for the millions of children currently attending schools without power, and for many hospitals without reliable energy.

Nobody should be left behind by the energy transition. The United Nations’ SDG 7 ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all – not for just some.

At OPEC, we listen extensively to the scientists. We wholeheartedly support the Paris Agreement and the ethos of multilateralism that underpins it. The core elements of the Convention, particularly historical responsibility and national circumstances must be adhered to.

We recognize the complexity and magnitude of climate change we are living in our countries. There is no panacea for global warming. All viable mitigation and adaptation measures are necessary.

Technological innovation, including Carbon Capture and Sequestration technologies (CCUS), enhanced investment for energy access, and improved energy efficiency must be part of the solution. The oil industry is committed to all of these.

The oil industry must be part of the solution to the impacts of climate change. We reject the misleading narrative of an energy transition from one source to another.

The energy transition must be holistic, inclusive, fair and equitable in accordance with the core UNFCCC principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

Thank-you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/72-10-december-2019.html"
"2019-12-06","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to welcome you all to the 7th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

As I look around the room, it is enormously pleasing to see so many OPEC Ministers and other heads of delegation from non-OPEC producing countries here today.

Sitting alongside me again is my friend and co-Chair for this meeting, His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. HE Novak continues to be a strong and committed advocate of the historic cooperation that has evolved between OPEC and non-OPEC, as we have sought to restore the much needed balance and sustainable stability to the oil market.

On my other side, is another comrade and brother, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, the OPEC Secretary General. HE Barkindo, and his team at the OPEC Secretariat, are the glue that holds us all together, through the excellent research, analysis and reports they prepare for us.

These form the basis of the work undertaken by the excellent supporting bodies of the ‘Declaration’, the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) and the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), which enables us take informed decisions.

The ‘Charter’ is a voluntary commitment and open to all producing countries. An innovative and inclusive framework longer term framework that aims to evolve oil’s role in an ever-shifting global energy mix, advancing the environmental credentials of oil and boosting energy efficiency across the value chain.

I hope that we can all look to extend an open invitation to other oil producing nations to join us. Robust and expanded cooperation is the most effective way to counter volatility and achieve common goals, for the benefit of producers, consumers and the global economy.

Today we welcome delegations of South Africa and Brazil that will participate at this Conference as observers. Thank you very much for joining all of us in this common effort.

Speaking on behalf of my beloved country, Venezuela, today it remains vital that the oil market is not leveraged as a means to attack the economies of sovereign nations, which directly affects the development and welfare of the people. This is clearly unjust and illegal, especially if the one who exercises it does so pursuing dominance.

We are steadfast in standing up to these unlawful actions, and I have no doubt that the country will overcome these hostile acts.

We look to the international community, and the support of OPEC, as well as non-OPEC producers in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, to resolve these challenges through open and fair dialogue.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

At the 177th Meeting of the OPEC Conference yesterday, we discussed the recent oil market situation and the 2020 prospects. These issues will now be deliberated with Your Excellencies.

There are evidently many variables at play including the US-China trade dispute, oil demand uncertainties, which includes potential upsides, and the role of non-OPEC supply outside of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, specifically a possible slowdown in growth levels from US tighter oil supply.

Our laser focus for 2020 needs to be on helping maintain the balance that has been achieved, and sustaining the ‘hard won’ stability that has been realized.

We cannot compromise on our goals or lose sight of our hard-earned achievements.

Over the last three years, our cooperation has proven to be effective. There is clarity that we are stronger working together. It is the only way to overcome our common challenges and achieve our common market stability goals that are conducive to the global economy at large.

Before I conclude, let me say that it has been an honour and a privilege to lead OPEC as Conference President in 2019, and to sit here with such distinguished colleagues at these OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meetings.

I wish my successor, HE Mohamed Arkab, Algeria’s Minister of Energy, all the best for 2020; a landmark year for OPEC as we celebrate the Organization’s 60th anniversary.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/73-6-december-2019.html"
"2019-12-05","Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

I would like to welcome you all back to Vienna, the home city of OPEC, for the 17th Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC).

I would like to begin be saying that it was with the deepest sadness that OPEC learnt of the passing of one of the Organization’s and the petroleum industry’s most esteemed and learned leaders, Dr. Fadhil J. Chalabi. The OPEC Secretariat extends its deepest and heartfelt condolences to the family of Dr. Chalabi.

May he rest in peace.

Looking around this room I think it also apt to offer some inspirational words from HE Hugo Chávez Frías, our revered former President of Venezuela, whose enduring legacy for both my country, and indeed for OPEC, continues to this day.

HE Chávez once said:

“Mutual respect! That's what it takes to be friends.”

It is a simple statement. But succinct and to the point. It is also extremely apt for all the producing countries that are part of the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ that has done so much to return balance and sustainable stability to the oil market.

Serving on this distinguished committee, as OPEC Conference President in 2019, and in my talks with ministers and delegates from countries in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, I feel mutual respect in everything we do. It is the overarching cog that keeps us all committed and driving in the same direction.

This was also clearly evident in early July this year, when our 24 countries endorsed the ‘Charter of Cooperation’; a longer term framework that will help us further evolve our landmark cooperation.

A central figure in the spirit of our cooperation has been HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. From the very beginning, his help in steering the JMMC to focus on the core objectives of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ – a balanced oil market and sustainable stability, in the interests of both producers and consumers – has been the backbone of the work we have undertaken.

At the previous meeting of the JMMC in Abu Dhabi, adeptly and graciously hosted by our good friend and colleague, HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister of Energy and Industry, HE Novak was joined as co-chair by a man renowned industry-wide for his integrity, humility and professionalism, His Royal Highness Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman.

His consummate diplomacy and his knowledge as an industry leader have been extremely welcome on this Committee.

The teamwork, flexibility and dedication of everyone involved in the almost three years of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ should be widely lauded.

Every country, every minister, every delegate, the vital and supportive Joint Technical Committee and the OPEC Secretariat, skilfully led by Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General. The bonds that keep us together are strong.

This comradeship can be viewed in the high-levels of conformity to the voluntary production adjustments since the last Ministerial Meetings in July this year.

It is important to stress, however, that individual conformity levels need to be met. Cohesion and its practical demonstration are the true keys to our success, be it conformity levels or more broadly acting in unison.

This strength will be vital as we approach 2020, and today we will review the outlook for the global economy, and oil supply and demand for the upcoming year.

What we deliberate, and our recommendations, will play into the calculations that will be presented to the ministerial meetings thereafter, as we look to chart a course that for 2020.

Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

It has been honour to serve on this committee in 2019 as OPEC Conference President.

It has been a humbling experience to represent this great Organization, to push the historic cooperation between our 24 countries, and to help foster and institutionalize this cooperation for years to come. I hope that I have been able to do this with respect to the underlying principles of equity, fairness and transparency.

But I realize there still remains work to do.

In looking to the upcoming meetings, let me conclude by saying that as partners in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ we always take a very measured approach – we look at the market outlook, we listen to consumers and other stakeholders, and I assure you that we are focused on the interests of the global economy.

With much mutual respect, thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/74-5-december-2019.html"
"2019-11-19","Good evening ladies and gentlemen,

It is both a pleasure and an inspiration to join you here in this splendid Palace that dates back to 1740 when Kaiser Franz Stephan von Lothringen purchased it. The Palace was used not only as his personal quarters, but also as a place to conduct diplomacy and exchange views on business and political affairs with his peers. The Kaiser had an avid interest in science, and thus had at his disposal a research library and a subterranean laboratory where he was able to carry out scientific experiments that gave birth to some commercial innovations. In addition, he had several rooms devoted to storing and displaying his collections, which, at that time, were collectively known as the Natural History Cabinet, and eventually expanded to form the basis of what was to become Vienna’s fabulous Natural History Museum.

It is thus very apt that this beautiful building, full of world history, diplomacy and connections to the wider world, be the home base for the Austrian-Russian Friendship Society, which is in the business of building bridges between Austria and Russia, both diplomatically, commercially and culturally.

Allow me to thank Dr. Richard Schenz, President of ORFG and Florian Stermann, Secretary General, for their kind invitation for me to speak here this evening. I am impressed by the good work ORFG is doing here in Vienna to forge good relations between Russia and Austria. In reflecting on the mission of ORFG, it occurred to me that OPEC’s work on the international stage, in close cooperation with Russia, mirrors what you are doing here in Vienna. We are both helping promote cooperation and understanding through a spirit of respect and goodwill to achieve our mutual goals. And, as I will share with you this evening, this is an approach that is bearing fruit.

I would also like to acknowledge His Excellency, Dmitrij Ljubinskij, Ambassador of the Russian Federation to Austria, and thank him for his support for OPEC and our ongoing efforts with Russia through the Declaration of Cooperation.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The timing of my participation here at ORFG is especially relevant as OPEC and Russia are at the forefront of an unprecedented era of international energy cooperation.

This new era of which I speak was initiated three years ago after the global oil market had experienced one of its worst downturns in history. Between 2014 and 2016, bloated inventories reached 5.5 mb/d, surpassing oil demand growth of 4.1 mb/d. By July 2016, the OECD commercial stock overhang had soared to a record high of about 403 mb over the five-year industry average. This triggered a massive drop in the OPEC Reference Basket price, which fell by a devastating 80% between June 2014 and January 2016.

This situation brought our industry to its knees. Nearly a half of million people lost their jobs, an estimated one trillion dollars in investments were either frozen or deferred, and a record number of companies filed for bankruptcy.

OPEC knew that the scale of this crisis required an urgent, coordinated response by all industry stakeholders to help reduce the massive stock overhang and rebalance the oil market.

Thus, a frenetic flurry of consultations between OPEC and other oil producers got underway. I spent the lion’s share of my time during this period in planes traversing the world’s regions and continents in an effort to rally support and help devise a rescue plan for the industry.

In February 2016, talks were initiated in Doha, Qatar between Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Russian Federation. Follow-up discussions were held in Doha again in April 2016 between all OPEC Member Countries, except IR Iran, and Russia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Oman, Mexico and Trinidad and Tobago.

These critical consultations continued in the months to follow and eventually bore fruit on the 10th of December 2016 with the signing of the Declaration of Cooperation between the OPEC Member Countries and 10 non-OPEC member countries, led by Russia.

This courageous and proactive stance virtually rescued an industry that was caught in a downward spiral, thereby helping restore confidence not only in the oil market, but in the global economy in 2017 and 2018.

Over the last three years, the OPEC-Russia relationship has continued to flourish and reach new milestones throughout the implementation phase of the Declaration of Cooperation, in which Russia has been a key contributor as Co-Chair of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee alongside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

These common efforts of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners, led by Russia, have helped forge a lasting bond of trust and mutual respect. Together, we have literally cast a new blueprint for how to optimize our efforts an industry that has become increasingly complex and volatile.

It is obvious that none of these monumental developments could have come to fruition if it weren’t for staunch support and leadership at the highest levels. In this regard, I must recognize the absolutely fundamental role played by the President of the Russian Federation, His Excellency Vladimir Putin, who has been a leading advocate of this endeavour. This support was evident when I had the opportunity to meet with HE President Putin on the sidelines of Russian Energy Week in Moscow last month. During our discussion, President Putin acknowledged the great success of the Declaration and Charter of Cooperation and pledged Russia’s ongoing support in the interest of producers and consumers. He also commended all participating countries for their ongoing commitment and contributions to sustainable stability in the global oil market.

I would like to note here that it was a great honour to receive His Excellency Dmitry Kozak, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, at the OPEC Secretariat on November 8th. In addition to discussing the latest developments in the oil market, we had a chance to sit down together and discuss the ongoing success of the Declaration and Charter of Cooperation and the importance of international energy cooperation as the most effective way to forge a lasting stability to the industry and maintain adequate long-term investment.

Another lynchpin of this process has, of course, been the Russian Minster of Energy, His Excellency Alexander Novak. His skilled diplomacy and deep industry experience have contributed greatly to our success.

Russia’s leadership not only supported the Declaration of Cooperation from the outset, but they saw the need, as did OPEC, for the creation of a permanent, long-term framework for cooperation that would extend beyond the limits and scope of the Declaration. This led to the signing of the Charter of Cooperationat the 6th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 2nd of July 2019. The Charter is a permanent, open and transparent platform for dialogue among participating countries with the goal of promoting oil market stability and cooperation on energy technology and other areas. The Charter will also provide a valuable mechanism for confronting the challenges that lay ahead, many of which are out of our control. Today, for example, the oil market is being challenged by a range of non-fundamental factors, such as geopolitics, natural disasters, trade disputes and evolving monetary policies, just to name a few.

This innovative and inclusive framework will also enable the long-term use of oil as a key element in the ever-shifting global energy mix while also boosting energy efficiency across the value chain and helping improve the environmental credentials of oil.

The Charter is a voluntary commitment and open to all producing countries. On my travels around the world, I constantly extend an open invitation to all oil producing nations to join this international campaign to promote stability and prosperity around the world.

Thus, in the years ahead, we clearly see robust and expanded cooperation as the most effective way forward to counter volatility and achieve our common goals, for the benefit of producers, consumers and global economy.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Another important framework of cooperation I would like to highlight this evening is the annual OPEC-Russia High-level Energy Dialogue, which will hold its seventh meeting in the first half of 2020.

The origins of this initiative date back to December 26th 2005, when a meeting in Moscow took place between delegations headed by HE Viktor Khristenko, then Minister of Industry and Energy of the Russian Federation and Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, former OPEC Conference President and Secretary General, who was also Minister of Oil of Kuwait.

The two leaders agreed on the framework for the Russia-OPEC Energy Dialogue that would determine its scope, objectives, modalities, frequency and overall structure. Both men stressed the importance of a pragmatic and sustained process of dialogue between the two parties. It was thus decided that annual meetings would take place at the ministerial level, which would be complemented by technical exchanges and collaboration on joint studies and research. These platforms would enable an ongoing forum of exchange on oil market developments and other areas of mutual interest, including energy policies, upstream and downstream investment, data flows and multilateral issues. This then led to the inaugural edition of the current series of High-level Energy Dialogues, which was held in September of 2012 at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna. The Meeting was chaired by the Russian Minister of Energy, HE Alexander Novak and my predecessor, OPEC Secretary General, Abdalla Salem El-Badri. At the conclusion of the event, the Secretary General stressed the value of open communication with like-minded stakeholders. He said: “We are continually looking to explore and evolve our dialogue and cooperation with other parties. We recognize the value of strong and mutually-beneficial relationships. And I hope that today’s meeting can reinforce the bond of cooperation between the Russian Federation and OPEC.”

Since then, this annual event has risen in stature to become an important and valuable forum for the exchange of oil and energy outlooks and forecasting, as well as joint studies and research. I must note here that His Excellency Alexander Novak has been intimately involved in this initiative from day one and has attended every edition. His keen understanding of the power of dialogue and his visionary leadership have elevated this dialogue platform to new heights.

OPEC holds similar bilateral and international energy dialogue initiatives, which include the European Union, China, India, the United States, the International Energy Forum, the International Energy Agency, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the G20, as well as with private sector technology and energy-related companies.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The last five years have been marked by extremes: by turbulence and recovery, by crisis and calm, by uncertainty and confidence.

Through it all though, one thing has made all the difference, and that can be summed up in one word: COOPERATION!

OPEC and its non-OPEC partners have turned the tides and ushered in a new and better way of doing business. A strategy that involves respect, collaboration and transparency. A strategy that is defined by what we have in common, rather then what makes us different. An approach that embraces tolerance and openness to the views of others. A modus operandi that brings out the best in all of us.

This is the new era in international energy cooperation, and I am confident there is much more to be achieved if we work together!

The legendary Russian pianist and composer, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, when speaking about his famous Symphony Number 6, or “Passionate Symphony” captured perfectly the deep satisfaction that comes from giving a project your all, and then being inspired to continually accomplish greater and greater things. He said, and I quote:

“I have put my whole soul into this work [The Passionate Symphony] . . . You cannot imagine what joy I feel at the thought that my days are not yet over and that I may still accomplish much.”

Ladies and gentlemen,

On behalf of OPEC, I would like to thank both the Republic of Austria, our Host Country, and the Russian Federation, our loyal partner on the international stage, for their strong support of and key contributions to OPEC’s mission of providing lasting stability in the global oil market and prosperity for future generations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/75-19-november-2019.html"
"2019-11-18","Distinguished guests, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning and welcome to the OPEC Secretariat for this Technical Meeting on Asian Energy and Oil Outlook. I want to welcome all of our delegates and experts from Asia who travelled from far and wide to be here today. We very much look forward to your valuable input and keen insights as we compare notes on future energy outlooks and seek to anticipate the challenges and uncertainties that may be on the horizon.

Inaugurated in 2015, this event, now in its fifth iteration, continues to be a valuable component of OPEC’s wider portfolio of producer-consumer dialogues. OPEC has ongoing dialogue initiatives with China, India, the Russian Federation, the European Union, the United States, the International Energy Forum and the International Energy Agency, and the most recent addition, the Gas Exporting Countries Forum. These efforts are a key part of our strategy to promote oil market stability through open and transparent international energy cooperation. I believe, looking ahead, this approach will be more important than ever as we seek to navigate an increasingly complex and inter-dependent international energy market.

Delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

When speaking of the future of energy, the continent of Asia is of utmost importance. Asia is and will continue to be the leading center for oil and energy demand growth as it seeks to fuel its rapidly growing economy and support the requirements of a rapidly expanding population. This is confirmed by our 2019 World Oil Outlook, which was officially launched on 5 November.

Global oil demand is expected to increase by roughly 12 mb/d, rising from 98.7 mb/d in 2018 to 110.6 mb/d in 2040. The majority of this growth will come from Asia due rapid population growth, an expanding middle class and swift economic expansion. Non-OECD oil demand is expected to rise by 21.4 mb/d between 2018 and 2040. Of this, India and China will lead the way with an estimated demand growth of 5.4 mb/d and 4.4 mb/d, respectively. From 2018 to 2040, the economies of India and China combined are forecast to expand from 27% of the global economy to 40%.

In both the medium- and long-term, the Asia-Pacific region is also set to be a leader in the expansion of refining capacity. At the global level, 8 mb/d of new crude distillation capacity from all assessed projects is expected between 2019 and 2024, with over 70% in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East.

Needless to say, increased refinery capacity in Asia will certainly require greater quantities of crude. This is reflected in the forecast for trade flows, which sees Asia-Pacific imports expanding. Our latest estimates show crude exports from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region increasing by around 7 mb/d between 2025 and 2040, rising to approximately 23 mb/d. This will make the Asia-Pacific region the primary outlet for Middle Eastern crude.

At last week’s ADIPEC event, we had the opportunity to discuss these key messages with several of our Asian partners, including Indian Oil Minister, His Excellency, Dharmendra Pradhan, at OPEC’s dedicated session on the 2019 World Oil Outlook. These positive discussions are clearly the outcome of years of dialogue and cooperation OPEC has had with its Asian partners and other consuming countries around the world.

I would also point out that the International Energy Agency has just released its World Energy Outlook 2019 in which a similar forecast is published regarding the important role oil and gas will continue to play in the long term to meet the massive demand growth, predominantly coming from Asia.

Additionally, I would like to point out the immense success of the Declaration of Cooperation between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producers in re-establishing balance to the global oil market. In July 2019, the Charter of Cooperation was endorsed, proving a longer-term institutional framework for this landmark cooperation. These key decisions are providing the groundwork for a sustainable stability as well as adequate and timely investment in the industry.

Finally, we must not forget the critical role of technology in addressing the challenges of meeting future energy demand while also increasing energy efficiency and addressing energy poverty, which, unfortunately continues to affect a significant part of the world population.

Looking at today’s agenda, in Session 1, we look forward to hearing a presentation on the main findings of our 2019 WOO. We will also benefit from presentations on the Asian perspectives on energy outlooks, trade negotiations and economic issues.

Another pressing issue for Asia that we will cover today in Session 2 entails the new IMO 2020 regulations on sulpur content in marine bunkers. We will look at this issue from a variety of perspectives to assess how these developments might affect the global and Asian markets.

Finally, in Session 3, we will have the opportunity to hear presentations on energy and oil outlooks from specific countries, including China, India, South Korea and Japan.

Delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

What happens in Asia, affects the entire industry. In this regard, today’s meeting will cover some of the most pressing issues in the global energy market. The presentations and discussions on our agenda will undoubtedly spark lively discussions and produce new and innovative insights.

In conclusion, I would add that the complexity of today’s energy market underscores the importance of forums like the one today. Increasingly, such opportunities for like-minded stakeholders to gather and discuss pressing issues of mutual concern should be a top priority.

With that in mind, let us proceed with our agenda. I wish you all very fruitful deliberations today.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/76-18-november-2019.html"
"2019-11-13","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to thank the Government of the United Arab Emirates, its Energy Ministry, ADNOC, as well as the organizers of ADIPEC, who have provided us with this platform to present our recently released 2019 World Oil Outlook (WOO).

ADIPEC, now in its 35th year, and held under the Patronage of His Highness, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, has evolved into one of the world’s top-tier international energy conferences and exhibitions.

For OPEC, this high-calibre event, hosted by our Member Country, the UAE, is a yearly highlight on our events calendar, and a must for the rollout of our annual WOO.

In particular, I would like to thank my good friends, HE Suhail Mohamed AI Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister of Energy and Industry and HE Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, the UAE’s Minister of State and the CEO of ADNOC Group.

HE Suhail has been a staunch supporter of OPEC, an exemplary Conference President in 2018, and a great enthusiast for the OPEC Secretariat’s research and analysis, the pinnacle of which is our WOO.

HE Dr Sultan has been at the forefront of driving ADNOC to become one of the world’s leading oil and gas companies, a vital cornerstone of the UAE’s success as a nation.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

This year’s WOO is the 13th edition. It has evolved in many ways since it was first launched in 2007, but its key guiding principle has remained the same: to support sustainable market stability and to provide a platform from which to review, analyze and evaluate how the oil and energy scene may develop.

The issue of sustainable market stability, as well as helping return balance to the market, can also be seen clearly in the success of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as in the July 2019 endorsement of the ‘Charter of Cooperation’, which provides a longer-term institutional framework for this landmark cooperation.

Allow me now to provide you with some key highlights and takeaways from this year’s Outlook, before my colleagues from the OPEC Secretariat undertake a panel discussion to drill down in more detail on various aspects of the publication.

Total primary energy demand is set to expand by a robust 25% between 2018 and 2040.

This will be driven by global economic expansion, which in 2040 is expected to be double the size it was in 2018, and population growth, which is projected to reach around 9.2 billion in 2040, an increase of around 1.6 billion from today’s level.

Moreover, it is also important to recall that close to one billion people still have no access to electricity and almost three billion people still lack access to clean energy fuels. It is a universal obligation to address the major challenge of energy poverty.

All forms of energy will be required to help meet this expanding demand in a sustainable way.

Renewables witness the largest growth in percentage terms, with significant expansion envisaged in OPEC Member Countries, particularly here in the UAE; natural gas the largest growth in terms of volume; and oil remains the fuel with the largest share in the energy mix to 2040.

In fact, oil and gas combined are still expected to make up more than 50% of the energy mix by 2040. In this regard, it is important to stress that we do not see any reputable publication in their reference outlooks, forecasting that renewables will come anywhere close to overtaking oil and gas in the decades ahead.

The non-OECD drives oil demand with expected growth of 21.4 mb/d by 2040, compared to 2018, whereas the OECD region is estimated to contract by 9.6 mb/d. Total oil demand is estimated to reach 110.6 million barrels a day (mb/d) by 2040.

Petrochemicals at 4.1 mb/d, road transportation at 2.9 mb/d and aviation at 2.4 mb/d are the main sectors for long-term oil demand growth. From the mid-2020s, however, non-OPEC sees a steady decline

Thus, OPEC Member Countries will be required to meet the majority of the longer-term demand requirements. Demand for OPEC liquids is projected to increase to around 44.4 mb/d in 2040, up from 36.6 mb/d in 2018.

In the downstream, crude distillation capacity additions of around 8 mb/d – close to 50% of the estimated total capacity additions to 2040 – are expected between 2019 and 2024, with over 70% in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.

This points to the potential for significant excess refining capacity in the medium-term period.

Global crude oil and condensate trade is estimated to remain relatively flat at around 38 mb/d between 2018 and 2025, before increasing to around 42 mb/d by 2040.

The major oil trade route remains the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific, with the UAE continuing to be a key hub. Total Middle East exports are set to increase by around 7 mb/d between 2025 and 2040 to reach close to 23 mb/d.

On the investment side, requirements across the upstream, midstream and downstream are estimated at around $10.6 trillion in the period to 2040.

OPEC Member Countries remain fully committed to investments across the whole industry value chain, and the issue of returning global investments is a core focus of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

The Outlook also reviews a plethora of technology innovations, policy issues and energy matters related to sustainable development.

A key message to highlight is the importance of technologies in reducing emissions. We need to look for more efficient technological solutions everywhere, across all available energies, and utilize all available and innovative options to reduce emissions from the energy sector. The oil and gas industries have to be part of the solution.

The WOO is not about predictions and should be viewed as a tool of reference to stimulate discussion and debate among industry stakeholders. This is vital given the crossroads that the energy industry finds itself at.

And let me stress, year-on-year, we continue to push the boundaries of our research, and to provide more data and analysis that can stimulate both debate and action.

This reminds me of a sagacious quote from the visionary Founding Father of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan. This gracious and humble man once said:

“We were like those who had climbed a mountain and reached the top. When we looked down, we still wanted to go higher to realise our goals. Despite all the achievements, we still have an ambition for more.”

His foresight, his discernment and his vision are a guide for us all.

Thank you to everyone here that is in attendance. We appreciate you listening, and my colleagues who have played such an important role in putting together this Outlook, alongside many others at our Secretariat, are anticipating robust questions and a constructive critique of the WOO.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/77-13-november-2019.html"
"2019-11-05","Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

It gives OPEC great pleasure to launch this year’s World Oil Outlook at the Börsensäle – the old Vienna Stock Exchange – here in the Secretariat’s home city of Vienna.

This beautiful Neo-Renaissance masterpiece, which was completed in 1877, has oceans of marble, acres of stucco, forests of columns and no end of space. It is a truly stunning piece of architecture, and just a short stroll across the road for us at the OPEC Secretariat!

We are extremely lucky to call Vienna our home; a city full of music, literature, arts and culture.

[SLIDE 2]

I would also like to welcome such a distinguished gathering here for this event, and to particularly thank my good friend, Rainer Seele, CEO of Austrian oil and gas company OMV, who just delivered some thoughtful and motivating remarks, and his excellent team for being part of our launch today.

We greatly value your support of this launch. OPEC’s relationship with OMV, not only here in Vienna, but in many of our Member Countries is a significant one. We hope it continues to blossom in the years and decades to come.

It is also a great pleasure to welcome HE Yury Sentyurin, Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), who has been central to helping evolve the productive relationship between OPEC and the GECF over the past few years. This was evident most recently in October 2019, when our two organizations signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen cooperation in research and the sharing of best practices.

I would also like to thank our moderator for today’s launch, the genial John Defterios from CNN. We always appreciate John’s views and insights, and we look forward to him guiding us through this morning’s programme.

[SLIDE 3]

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

This year’s World Oil Outlook is the 13th edition; it has come a long way since it was first launched back in 2007.

It has more than doubled in size adding both depth and breadth; it has greatly expanded its data sharing and analysis; and it now has an online interactive version, first launched in 2015, as well as a smart app that gives increased access to the publication's vital analysis and energy data. To put it simply, it has enabled the Organization to become more open and transparent.

Its evolution is testament to the tremendous work undertaken by the research, editorial and design teams at the OPEC Secretariat. Without them, we would not have the high-class publication that we present to you today. The Organization is enormously proud of their efforts.

What I should stress, however, is that one thing has not changed. In the first edition back in 2007, it was emphasized that the Outlook was meant to contribute to the Organization’s commitment to support sustainable market stability and to provide a platform from which to review, analyze and evaluate how the oil and energy scene may develop.

This key guiding principle remains central to the Outlook.

The issue of sustainable market stability, as well as helping return balance to the market, can also be seen clearly in the success of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as in the July 2019 endorsement of the ‘Charter of Cooperation’, which provides a longer-term institutional framework for this landmark cooperation.

Turning to the World Oil Outlook 2019, the publication underlines the increasingly complex nature of the oil industry, both in the upstream and downstream; the continued energy interdependence of all nations; how security of supply and security of demand are very much interlinked; and the need to better understand the market drivers, challenges, uncertainties, as well as opportunities, we all face. These include such issues as policies, technology developments, energy poverty, climate change and sustainable development.

Allow me now to provide you with a number of key takeaways from this year’s publication, before we have a panel discussion and a Q&A with management and analysts from OPEC’s Research Division.

[SLIDE 4]

Total primary energy demand is set to expand by a robust 25% between 2018 and 2040. This will be driven by expansion in the global economy, which in 2040 is expected to be double the size it was in 2018, and population growth, which is projected to reach around 9.2 billion in 2040, an increase of around 1.5 billion from today’s level.

Moreover, we also need to remember that close to one billion people still have no access to electricity and almost three billion people still lack access to clean energy fuels. It is a universal obligation to address the major challenge of energy poverty.

Energy is a central facet that links our daily lives; it is not on call, it cannot take a holiday, it cannot call in sick. Energy is a 24-hour service.

[SLIDE 5]

It is also clear that all forms of energy will be required to help meeting this expanding demand in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social well-being, the economy and the environment.

Renewables are coming of age, and are forecast to witness the largest growth in percentage terms, but even by 2040 all renewables combined are only estimated to make up around 19% of the global energy mix.

Natural gas experiences the largest demand growth, the share of coal drops the most, and oil is expected to remain the fuel with the largest share in the energy mix throughout the forecast period to 2040.

We appreciate that some will view this as an OPEC forecast, and dispute the numbers.

Firstly, let me say that many OPEC Member Countries have great sources of solar and wind, and we are seeing huge investments being made in this field. We fully support the development of renewables.

And secondly, we do not see any reputable publication projecting, in their reference outlooks, that renewables will come anywhere close to overtaking oil and gas in the decades ahead.

[SLIDE 6]

Oil demand is forecast to reach 110.6 million barrels a day (mb/d) by 2040. The non-OECD drives oil demand with expected growth of 21.4 mb/d by 2040, compared to 2018, whereas the OECD region is estimated to contract by 9.6 mb/d.

Long-term oil demand growth comes mainly from petrochemicals at 4.1 mb/d, road transportation at 2.9 mb/d and aviation at 2.4 mb/d.

[SLIDE 7]

In the road transportation sector, which will remain by far the largest sector for oil demand, the total vehicle fleet – including passenger and commercial vehicles – is estimated to grow by more than 1 billion to around 2.4 billion vehicles on the road by 2040.

It is also noticeable that the long-term share of electric vehicles in the total fleet is projected to reach a level of around 13% in 2040, supported by falling battery costs and incentivizing policies, but the majority of the growth continues to be for conventional vehicles.

One key point to underline from the Outlook is that in the period to 2040, fuel efficiency improvements are expected to result in a greater reduction in oil demand, than the increasing penetration of alternative fuel vehicles.

[SLIDE 8]

On the supply side, non-OPEC liquids supply is projected to grow by 9.9 mb/d between 2018 and 2024. The majority is forecast to come from US tight oil, but Brazil, Norway, Canada, Guyana and Kazakhstan are also expected to contribute to this increase.

From the mid-2020s, however, non-OPEC sees a steady decline, with US total liquids supply set to peak around this time. It underscores that it is OPEC Member Countries that will be required to meet the majority of the longer-term demand requirements.

Demand for OPEC liquids is projected to increase to around 44.4 mb/d in 2040, up from 36.6 mb/d in 2018.

[SLIDE 9]

From the perspective of the downstream, crude distillation capacity additions of around 8 mb/d are expected between 2019 and 2024, with over 70% in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.

It should be noted that this is close to 50% of the expected total capacity additions of 16.5 mb/d required in the long-term to 2040. This points to the potential for significant excess refining capacity in the medium-term period.

In terms of trade, global crude oil and condensate trade is estimated to remain relatively static at around 38 mb/d between 2018 and 2025, before increasing to around 42 mb/d by 2040.

Two trends are worth highlighting in this regard. The first is that in the medium-term the US & Canada, as one region, is expected to increase crude and condensate exports, on the back of growth in tight oil production.

The second is that over the entire forecast period, the major oil trade route remains the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific. Total Middle East exports are set to increase by around 7 mb/d between 2025 and 2040 to reach around 23 mb/d.

[SLIDE 10]

The scale of what lies ahead is brought home by the investment requirements. Oil-related investments across the upstream, midstream and downstream are estimated at around $10.6 trillion in the period to 2040.

From OPEC’s perspective, we fully identify with the fact that the foundation for investment, growth and economic diversification can only come through balance and stability in the market.

In this regard, OPEC Member Countries remain fully committed to investments across the whole industry value chain, and the issue of returning global investments is a core focus of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

[SLIDE 11]

This year’s Outlook also reviews a plethora of technology innovations, policy issues and energy matters related to sustainable development.

A key focus is on the Paris Agreement, which OPEC is fully engaged with and supportive of. All 14 OPEC Member Countries have signed the Paris Agreement and ten have ratified it.

The Outlook highlights that energy-exporting developing countries are likely to be disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate response measures related to possible economic diversification options. It is vital that there is an enhancement of the understanding of the measures’ impacts and a proper treatment of their implications.

It also emphasizes the importance of economic diversification efforts as an approach to mitigate risk arising from the implementation of climate response measures, although there is no one-size-fits-all prescription for these efforts.

What is also evident is the importance of technologies in reducing emissions. We need to look for more efficient technological solutions everywhere, across all available energies, and utilize all available and innovative options to reduce emissions from the energy sector. We should not limit ourselves by putting all our eggs in one basket.

As Bob Dudley, CEO of BP, said at the Oil & Money conference in London recently; when tackling emissions there needs “to be recognition that … there are many paths and we need to pursue them all.”

At OPEC, we recognize the complexity of the challenge. Complex problems require comprehensive solutions. The oil industry has to be part of the solution; it possesses critical resources and expertise that can help unlock our emissions-free future and ensure there is enough supply to meet expected future demand growth.

[SLIDE 12]

It is also important to stress that the World Oil Outlook is not about making predictions. We believe that the Outlook should be viewed as a tool of reference to stimulate informed discussion and debate among industry stakeholders, which we hope will lead to a better understanding of the future of the industry, and, hence, allow us to develop optimal strategies.

It is vital that we all continue to listen and learn. It was the legendary Henry Ford who once said:

“Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young.”

We hope this publication not only proves insightful, but also keeps you young too!

It is clear that the sharing of viewpoints is critical to our industry’s future, not only in the short-term, but in the medium- and long-term.

[SLIDE 13]

What I can say is that OPEC, and I am sure the entire oil and gas industry, welcomes dialogue with all stakeholders; and welcomes action too.

It is therefore my distinct honour and privilege to launch the OPEC WOO 2019.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/78-5-november-2019.html"
"2019-10-21","Distinguished guests, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

I want to express my deep and sincere thanks for your participation in this meeting, which marks another milestone in OPEC-China relations. It is with deepest respect and admiration for our esteemed guests that I can conclude that our mutual sharing has deepened understanding on both sides.

Our growing partnership represents a win-win situation not only for us, but for the entire oil market and global economy. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of our dialogue in shaping future decisions on production as well as investment.

I thank you for the considered information you have shared with us today. We add this to the valuable arsenal of facts we received from your colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences just a few days ago here at the OPEC Secretariat.

Your country has one of the oldest and most established cultures in the world and has overcome hardship time and again. The rapid development seen in China over the past few decades is nothing short of remarkable and is a testament to your country’s creativity, hard work and determination. We hope that we will continue on a broader and ever more intensive scale to share with you and learn from you and the deep and wide experience of your esteemed colleagues going forward.

In order for us to continue to do our job well at OPEC — balancing the oil market for the benefit of producers, consumers, the world economy and the future development of mankind — we need timely and reliable data and statistics. This is particularly important in the case of China when one considers the massive influence your country has on world energy developments.

The power of cooperation and dialogue has been amply shown through three years of the Declaration of Cooperation process, which brought groups of formerly disparate countries together to achieve something never before thought possible.

Together we continue stand strong and our cohesion and determination has led the world oil market out of the extremely dark spot it was mired in during the last oil market downturn in 2014-2016. I shudder to think what may have happened had we not managed this enormous feat together. And in we have set the stage to be able to continue our regular dialogue and cooperation through the Charter of Cooperation in the future.

The upcoming challenges are many and complex: climate change, energy poverty, trade disputes, geopolitics, a softening economy, policy changes, population growth, sanctions, you name it. These and more are going to continue to strongly affect us in the coming days, months and years. We need to be ready for each challenge ahead of time, and prepare for every eventuality. We can only do this together as partners who are able to communicate quickly and openly as situations arise. Maintaining channels of communication at all times and exchanging facts and data regularly will lessen the impact of large bumps down the road. It is the only way forward; in an industry that has become increasingly inter-connected over time, nobody can afford to go it alone anymore.

A famous Chinese proverb shows the power of patience and determination: “A man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones.” OPEC and non-OPEC partners to the Declaration of Cooperation started moving small stones back in 2016 as a group of countries determined to make a change, and look what we have accomplished today! We have moved much of a mountain, though there always remains more stones to carry.

I also like Confucius’s quote: “The man who says he can and the man who says he can’t are both correct.”

We can determine the future of our world, including the oil industry and the world economy through our collaboration and hard work. And we need to continue to work together with patience, with diligence and with an eye on the future – for the sake of future generations.

As we move forward, we agree to continue our successful collaboration through, among others, internships, technical cooperation and joint studies.

We are honoured to be your partner in development and to tackle future problems together. Together we are strong.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/79-21-october-2019.html"
"2019-10-21","HE Zhang Jianhua, Administrator of the National Energy Administration of the People’s Republic of China and his esteemed delegation, Dr. Sun Xiansheng, Secretary General of IEF, distinguished guests, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

It is an honour and a pleasure to host the Chinese delegation here in Vienna for the 3rd High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue. Last time you gracefully hosted us in December 2017 in Beijing, a trip to your beautiful and historical capital.

This followed on the heels of the First High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue which took place a very long time ago, in December 2005. It seems our dialogues are coming closer together, a trend which I hope to see sustained. This underwrites the enthusiasm on both sides to deepen our relations and look for future possibilities for knowledge exchange.

We have attended various other official meetings together in the meantime and our exchange of information is rich and ongoing, which we all very much appreciate.

This includes a very successful meeting between OPEC and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, which took place recently at the OPEC Secretariat on 11 October this year. I hope today’s discussions will take this collaboration another step further.

The core of OPEC’s mission is open and transparent dialogue with all stakeholders in the energy industry. We believe that only through constructive dialogue can we effectively find sustainable solutions to energy industry problems. Deepening our relationship and understanding the challenges we each face builds friendships and ensures mutually beneficial outcomes.

China is a very important trade partner for OPEC and our Member States, one whose significance has grown over time. Additionally, China’s leadership and critical role in the global economy and the energy industry cannot be understated.

The trade numbers, for example, tell the story. OPEC exports to China have risen from over $5.5 billion in 2000 to over $104 billion in 2018. Meanwhile, OPEC imports from China have also drastically jumped from $8.3 billion in 2000 to nearly $176 billion in 2018. This represents massive growth in overall trade between China and our Member Countries.

The global economy is expected to more than double from 2017 to 2040, according to our latest World Oil Outlook. China’s role in this picture is significant. While China accounted for 18 per cent of global GDP in 2017, this amount is projected to rise a whopping six percentage points to reach 24 per cent by 2040!

World oil demand is to rise from 97.2 mb/d in 2017 to 111.7 mb/d in 2040, with China accounting for nearly 30 per cent of that growth! Accordingly, China’s demand for oil is set to rise from 12.3 mb/d in 2017 to 17.4 mb/d in 2040, or by 5.1 mb/d.

This great country became the world’s biggest importer of crude oil in 2017, overtaking the US. In 2018, over 62 per cent of OPEC crude exports went to the Asia Pacific region, with the majority headed for China. So as you can see, there are crucial ties between OPEC Member Countries and China which are critical for both of us.

The percentage of oil in China’s fuel share is also expected to rise, going from 18 per cent in 2015 to 19.5 per cent in 2040, according to our WOO 2018. This means that although China has been making great leaps and bounds in the field of renewables, the need for oil will continue to grow significantly.

The share of renewables and nuclear energy in China’s energy pie will also rise dramatically in that time, with nuclear energy going from 1.5 per cent in 2015 to 7.4 per cent in 2040, and ‘other renewables’, including solar and wind, up from 1.6 to 6.4 per cent. Natural gas use will also more than double to 11.3 per cent. What is clear is that all sources of energy are going to be required to meet China’s growing future needs, as you clearly elaborated during our joint meeting.

This is confirmed by figures on China’s expected increase in per capita energy consumption over this time frame, which is expected to rise significantly from 16 barrels of oil equivalent to over 21 barrels of oil equivalent.

In the medium term, structural changes in the Chinese economy will affect oil demand, specifically slowing it in some sectors, such as industry and energy. However, strong oil demand is set to continue in the road transportation and aviation sectors, as the country’s expanding middle class gives rise to mobility needs, despite growth in the sale of alternative vehicles.

China’s vehicle stock levels are expected to rise more than twice as fast as the rest of the world from 2017-2040 at 4.3 per cent per annum. Although the share of electrical vehicles in overall vehicle stocks will rise significantly, it comes from a low base, and internal combustion engines will by far continue to dominate.

The petrochemical sector will also see strong growth, with totals behind only the United States. World refining capacity additions between 2018 and 2023 are projected at around 7.8 mb/d. Of this amount, China will add 1.7 mb/d, or over 20 per cent, which will also require greater amounts of crude oil feedstock.

Our message at this important gathering is that even with the country’s great advances in renewables, oil is going to continue to remain a major and growing provider within China’s energy mix for the foreseeable future. Thus it is essential for us to grow our exchange and expand close and transparent collaboration over the coming decades.

I want to emphasize here that although according to our WOO 2018, oil’s share in the world energy mix is anticipated to decline from nearly 32 per cent in 2015 to 28 per cent in 2040, it will still remain higher than any other fuel in the forecast period.

Excellency, distinguished delegates,

I want to congratulate China on moving quickly to achieve what many countries are striving to do — introducing and managing a very diverse and balanced energy portfolio. This provides not only energy security for the country’s future but positively affects CO2 emissions, as is also intended in the country’s ‘blue skies’ project.

China has made leaps and bounds in the last decade in reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions per unit of GDP. Following the 2016 Paris Agreement, China made a commitment to use non-fossil fuel energy for 20 per cent of its energy supply by 2030.

Meanwhile, China has become the world’s largest producer of renewable energy — it is the largest producer of hydroelectricity, solar power and wind power worldwide. This includes becoming the world’s largest producer, exporter and installer of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles, according to a recent report.

China has made a huge shift, heading south-south energy climate discussions, as well as deploying clean energy policy and working as a leader in this area.

This great country has been carefully planning its energy strategy and strongly pursuing policies and actions to ensure that its energy access across a range of fields is more secure, affordable and reliable. This shows great foresight and is a stellar example to other countries struggling with energy security. You have indeed become a leader and an example of starting to successfully move into the ‘energy transition’.

The words of famous Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu from way back around 500 BC, still ring true today: “A journey of 1000 miles begins with a small step.”

As your great leader President Xi Jinping stated: “China will always remain the builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, and upholder of international order.” We are counting on the President’s wisdom, commitment and engagement to help us overcome these current challenges.

I just want to add here that OPEC Member Countries have contributed immensely to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change process from its inception. OPEC’s efforts to confront climate change include constructive participation in UN negotiation sessions and a deepening and expanding relationship with the UNFCCC Secretariat over the past few years. I have often stated that the oil and gas industry must be part of the solution to climate change. I am glad that you also share the same view.

OPEC had partnered with China under the umbrella of the G77 and China (coalition of 134 developing countries in the United Nations), which I had the honour to chair, in producing the UNFCCC, its sister the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement and the current Talanoa Dialogue.

One difficulty in being one of the largest and fastest-growing energy consumers over the last decade is sustaining rapid economic growth, which has in part led to China becoming the world’s largest importer of oil. OPEC has been very pleased to have been a strong partner with China, helping to fuel its rapid development and looks forward to long and fruitful future collaboration.

You have been working extensively on increasing your strategic petroleum reserves in recent years. This shows a great deal of foresight and wisdom; China is once again setting an example for the rest of the world.

As we have seen with the recent attacks in September on key oil facilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, such reserves are essential to stabilizing the oil market in the case of any unforeseen circumstances. OPEC has consistently said that we need more investment in the industry, not only to provide for current demand, but in order to maintain future energy security.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The need for a sustainable oil market in light of the serious downturn that was jeopardizing producers, consumers and the world economy in 2016 was behind the decision of OPEC and non-OPEC countries to come together in this room on December 10, 2016 to sign the historic Declaration of Cooperation. This turned a glorious page in the history of oil. And a new glorious chapter is currently being authored by the 24 courageous nations in the overall interest of producing and consuming nations, including China.

We have learned so much since then. Not only have we overcome all market challenges thrown our way since that time, we have done so quickly, effectively and always considering our underlying principles of equity, transparency and collaboration.

It was with great pride that I saw these countries take our cooperation one step further to sign the Charter of Cooperation at our 6th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in July in this room. This confirms at the highest level, their deep commitment and fortitude. China as a major consumer of energy deserves a seat at the Charter of Cooperation.

The power of cooperation is clear. Our collaboration has led to a new era of responsible oil market management, which has proven to be a necessary tool in a global environment that seems to only grow in complexity. The international community and energy industry have come to count on OPEC to sustain this balance to enable them to write their own economic plans. We hope too, that sustainable stability will continue to encourage investment into the industry to avoid any future crisis.

An initially unexpected benefit of our cooperation with other countries has been the deepening of relationships and understanding. This has enabled more opportunities to work and learn together through workshops and sharing of experiences. We believe exactly these elements will enable all of us in the industry to plan for the future. I hope to see our relationship with China deepen and prosper under your able leadership, including pooling our collective expertise to better face tomorrow’s challenges.

I am looking forward to fruitful discussions and exchange, and hope this is another important stone on what I hope to see become a well-worn path between OPEC and People’s Republic of China.

Thank-you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/80-21-october-2019.html"
"2019-10-15","Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

It is a great pleasure to be back in India and to participate in the 3rd India Energy Forum by CERAWeek.

I have had the great fortune to attend each year, and wish to applaud IHS Markit, along with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, for making this event so compelling and successful.

It is a privilege for me to once again share the floor with Dan Yergin, one of the world’s foremost energy icons and a wonderful friend of OPEC.

And I would like to thank our extraordinary host, the Honourable Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Steel. It was a pleasure to spend time recently with Minister Pradhan and Dan at the World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi.

I have had the good fortune to work closely with Minister Pradhan through our OPEC-India Energy Dialogues, which began in 2015 and have become more valuable with each passing year. The next high-level energy dialogue is in December this year.

India’s enthusiasm for producer and consumer dialogue has contributed enormously to our success in restoring sustainable stability to the world oil market.

India imports around 80% of its oil from OPEC and our Member Countries are forging ever-closer investment ties with India.

In this respect, our dialogues provide a deeper understanding of India’s needs. Furthermore, our expanding technical consultations contribute to ensuring a secure and stable energy future.

Minister Pradhan tweeted about the value of these ever-closer bonds following our meeting on the sidelines of the World Energy Congress:

“OPEC is an important energy partner for India. We explored ways to further enhance collaboration between India and OPEC and work together to address the issues of energy poverty and energy security.”

Ladies and gentlemen,

Our topic this morning is the ‘Impact of Global Oil Markets on India’. If I may, I will take a moment to talk about the impact of India on the global oil market before turning to the global market more broadly.

It should come as no surprise to anyone who has visited this dynamic country that India is one of the major drivers of global economic and oil demand growth. The country’s GDP is projected to grow by 6.1% in 2019 and 6.7% in 2020, making it one of the world’s fastest growing economies.

Our latest figures for India show that oil demand increased in August by 0.12 mb/d for the second month running with total consumption of 4.61 mb/d. The country’s oil demand growth in 2019 is estimated at 0.14 mb/d y-o-y, accounting for 15% of global oil demand growth.

Looking further down the road, let me cite a few figures from OPEC’s flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook. The newest edition will be released on 5 November, offering even more updated insights:

Ladies and gentlemen,

Energy security goes to the core of OPEC’s being.

We have demonstrated repeatedly our commitment to sustainable stability, even during unprecedented events like the attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities one month ago.

In the immediate aftermath of these shocking attacks, Saudi Arabia moved swiftly to ensure a stable supply to the global market as it worked to restore its production capacity. Its exemplary handling of the situation very quickly stabilized markets and allayed concerns about supply disruptions.

Additionally, the oil industry is in a much stronger position today to deliver a sustainable energy supply than it was just three years ago.

This turnaround is thanks largely to the efforts undertaken by OPEC Member Countries and 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries, who came together in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ to reverse the 2014-2016 industry crisis.

Since 2016, the production adjustments undertaken by the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ partners have brought durable stability to the global oil market, restored investor confidence, and benefited producers and consumers.

Furthermore, these market-balancing measures continue to provide crucial support to the world economy.

Building on these impressive results, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ partners have endorsed a voluntary ‘Charter of Cooperation’. As a matter of fact, Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation further underscored their commitment to the ‘Charter’ at a ceremony held this week in Riyadh. The ‘Charter’ takes a crucial step beyond the ‘Declaration’s’ important focus on supply adjustments.

What does this mean for an important oil-consuming nation like India?

First, the ‘Charter’ provides a durable foundation for the opportunity to facilitate dialogue; promote a better understanding of market fundaments; support energy sustainability; and promote technological advancement.

OPEC does not believe in one-way streets. Throughout the ‘Declaration’ process we’ve been diligent in listening to the views of India and other oil-consuming nations. The ‘Charter’ provides a further means to engage in a constructive and consultative process.

Secondly, the ‘Charter’ better positions us to address one of the greatest challenges our planet faces.

That challenge is climate change.

With its vast coastline and growing population, India knows all too well the risks if we don’t act.

I was extremely impressed by HE Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks to the UN Climate Action Summit last month in New York. The Prime Minister highlighted India’s visionary plans for the energy transition and used the example of public-private partnerships to drive innovative solutions.

India’s colossal success in expanding access to energy is further testament to the country’s socioeconomic progress and commitment to sustainable development.

At OPEC, we also are engaged in and supportive of collective efforts – including the Paris Agreement and the ongoing UN climate discussions – to address the climate change challenge.

Looking ahead, we believe the most effective approach to mitigating the effects of climate change is through deeper cooperation and public policies that encourage a sustainable energy mix where oil is a fuel of choice.

Related to this, the oil industry will continue to need a supportive investment climate if we are to meet the world’s energy expanding needs while also delivering climate solutions.

However, factors that dampen investment in the oil sector include extremes in market volatility, geopolitical interference, and more recently the discriminatory nature of policies against oil and gas.

Those of you who have read Dan Yergin’s extraordinary books know that the oil industry has historically been a leader in developing and deploying technologies that deliver progressive improvements in efficiency, exploration and delivery. These advances, in turn, ensure a secure and stable supply of energy in the interests of oil-producing and consuming countries, and the global economy at large.

Thank you for listening. I look forward to continuing our discussion.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/81-15-october-2019.html"
"2019-10-13","Excellencies,
Dignitaries,
Ladies and gentlemen,

I am honoured to participate in the Kuwait Oil and Gas Show, under the patronage of the Prime Minister, HH Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al-Sabah, and to be part of this panel with such esteemed colleagues. I have great admiration for our moderator, Dr Nader Sultan, who has distinguished himself through his life-long contributions to the world of energy.

It is always a pleasure for me to return home to the great State of Kuwait, one of five Founder Members of OPEC. I am grateful to my brother Dr Khaled Al-Fadhel, Minister of Oil, Electricity and Water, for helping to make this event possible and for hosting us so generously, and the inexhaustible energy he devotes to OPEC since his arrival as a key member of the family.

I was inspired by the comments of Dr Al-Fadhel along with those of Hashem Sayed Hashem, Deputy Chairman and CEO of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, and Dr Sami Alnuaim. Dr Alnuaim very capably wears two hats – one as President of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the other as Manager of the Petroleum Engineering Application Services Department at Saudi Aramco.

It is a testament to the hard work of all the organizers and contributors that the Kuwait Oil & Gas Show has in a very short time become a premier industry event, held in this heart of the world’s most important oil-producing region.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Turning to our panel discussion this evening, allow me to make a few points about how OPEC views ‘The New Energy Transition’.

As is true of any business, the oil industry faces inevitable challenges and uncertainties. Today, we are feeling the headwinds of the US-China trade situation and other geopolitical tensions, slowing growth in some of the leading economies, and the risk of supply/demand imbalance.

Yet if we look a little further down the road, the outlook for the petroleum industry remains bright.

OPEC’s flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook, projects steady future growth in the demand for oil. This rise in demand is based on the growing energy needs of developing countries, with their expanding populations and middle class.

Let me highlight a few assumptions from the current Outlook:

Ladies and gentlemen,

While the outlook for the petroleum sector is bright, the industry also has a responsibility to be part of the solution to the challenge of climate change. We must be more than a stable energy supplier.

Let me identify three important and interconnected points on how we can retain a competitive position while addressing the climate issue.

First, the oil industry needs both a seat at the table in the discussions on the energy future – and a level playing field when it comes to energy policy making.

This is why OPEC has supported the Paris Agreement and is fully engaged at the multilateral level in discussions on climate policy: We too believe that we have no alternative planet to relocate to!

OPEC has demonstrated in other ways how dialogue, transparency and cooperation are the most effective approach to successfully dealing with challenges.

Allow me to cite the example of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between the 14 OPEC Member Countries and 10 other important oil-producing nations. This strategic partnership is built on – and owes its success to – the values I just mentioned: dialogue, transparency and working together.

The ‘Declaration’ has been a game-changer for the industry. The production adjustments undertaken by the participating countries over the past three years have reversed the severe oil market crisis of 2014-2016 and restored durable stability to the global oil market.

OPEC and the world will continue to be indebted to His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah for the leadership role he played in midwifing the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. The epitome of statesmanship and humility, I was privileged to drink from his fountain of wisdom and immensely benefited from his rich reservoir of knowledge as well as extensive global experience in those difficult times.

On behalf of myself and OPEC, we wish His Highness long life, good health and many years of service to Kuwait and the international community.

The success of the partnership and the market-balancing measures it has undertaken owe much to the unwavering support of Kuwait that continues to serve on our JMMC and the steadfast leadership now being set forth by Khaled Al-Fadhel.

In July this year, the 24 participating countries in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ unanimously endorsed a ‘Charter of Cooperation’. This voluntary initiative puts us in a stronger position over the longer term to address areas of common interest, including energy security, the energy transition and the challenge of climate change.

Since dialogue, transparency and cooperation have been so successful in rescuing the oil industry from the most severe cycle, why not apply the same values to addressing other challenges? That is, to turn challenges into opportunities?

A second important point about the energy future is the need for sustained leadership in the development and deployment of technologies that have – throughout the history of the oil industry – fostered progressive improvements in efficiency, exploration and delivery.

Looking ahead, the successful deployment of carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) and other emissions-reducing innovations could strengthen the industry’s competitiveness and affirm its commitment to tackle climate issues.

Many OPEC Member Countries are fortunate to have abundant renewable energy potential and are working to exploit these resources for industrial and domestic use, while also harnessing advanced technologies to improve efficiency along the entire petroleum production chain.

Finally, the oil industry needs a supportive investment climate if we are to meet the world’s energy needs and deliver solutions to climate challenges. OPEC estimates that investments of almost $11 trillion in the industry will be needed to address the demand and supply outlook I mentioned earlier.

The most disadvantageous and harmful factors that dampen the investment in oil and gas sector are extremes in market volatility, geopolitical interference, and more recently the discriminatory nature of policies against oil and gas.

As Bill Gates noted recently, fossil fuel divestment has zero climate impact. The Microsoft founder’s advice to investors is to instead back technology that helps cut emissions:

“Those who want to change the world would do better to put their money and energy behind the disruptive technologies that slow carbon emissions and help people adapt to a warming world.”

Ladies and gentlemen,

Oil has fuelled the current civilization and will continue to remain a fuel of choice in a broader energy mix if the whole industry and major stakeholders – policymakers, corporate chieftains, scientific institutions, financial and investment community – all rise in unison and confront the twin challenge of climate change and energy poverty. The best is yet to come for the oil and gas industry.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/82-13-october-2019.html"
"2019-10-10","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Returning to my second home, London, in early October, it can only be for one thing: the annual Oil & Money conference. This year’s event is a milestone; the 40th edition of this leading energy industry conference.

​I would like to thank the Chair of this session, Amena Bakr, for her generous introduction, as well as the organizers, Energy Intelligence, for the invitation to speak to such a distinguished audience.

​Over the four decades of this conference the energy landscape has changed a great deal, but one thing has remained constant: the ever-increasing need for stable and secure energy supplies as populations have expanded and economies have grown. This remains true as we look at the decades to come.

​The global economy in 2040 is expected to be double the size it was in 2018. And world population is projected to reach around 9.2 billion, an increase of around 1.5 billion from today’s level.

​We should also not forget that energy poverty remains a scourge of our time: even though, positively, the UN Secretary General’s progress report on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recently noted that the total number of people with access to electricity fell below one billion in 2017, there is much work still to be done.

​Moreover, three billion people still lack access to low-emission fuels for cooking.

​In OPEC’s most recent World Oil Outlook (WOO), we see global energy demand increasing by around 33% by 2040.

​Energy will remain central to our daily lives; the lifeblood that enables us all to function and prosper.

​Today, however, as referenced by the theme of this year’s conference, ‘Strategies for the Energy Transition’, the energy industry finds itself at a crossroads.

​The world needs more energy, but this needs to be done in an ever more efficient and sustainable way; taking on board the challenges posed by climate change to our future.

​Standing here before you today, I think it is important to state clearly OPEC’s position on climate change and the much talked about energy transition.

​We fully support the science. This is a given. We do not deny the existence of climate change. There are no climate deniers in OPEC.

​OPEC takes climate change extremely seriously. As responsible citizens of the globe, we also believe there is ‘no planet B’.

​OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, which remain the only viable global frameworks to address climate change. All 14 OPEC Member Countries have signed the Paris Agreement and ten have ratified it.

​We see it as a positive development that climate change issues have garnered increased public attention and enthusiasm.

​It is our deeply held conviction that dialogue on this matter should be inclusive and broad to try and evolve this energy transition in the least disruptive manner.

​We need to think carefully about what an energy transition actually means; and we all need to follow the right paths to lead us to a sustainable energy future.

​We need to all work together, step-by-step, find issues of commonality and appreciate what is at stake.

​We need to transition to a more inclusive world in which every person has access to energy. A world where no one is left behind.

​As Ben van Beurden, CEO of Shell, said at this conference yesterday: “The world needs oil and gas because it is what the world relies on for so much including, often, its most basic needs of heat and food and shelter. And that will not change overnight. This is why Shell will continue to invest in oil and gas, even as we work to help speed progress to a lower-carbon future.”

​There are clearly some who believe the oil and gas industries should not be part of our energy future; that we should be consigned to the past. That the future is one that can be dominated by renewables and electric vehicles.

​It is important to state clearly that the science does not tell us this; it tells us that we need to reduce emissions and use energy more efficiently. The stark statistics related to the blight of energy poverty do not tell us this either.

​Renewables are coming of age, with wind and solar expanding fast, but even by 2040 in our WOO they are only estimated to make up around 19% of the global energy mix.

​With nuclear expected to be at just over 6% and coal at just over 21% by 2040, it means that oil and gas combined are forecast to still supply over 50% of the world’s energy needs by 2040, with oil at around 28% and gas at 25%.

​We appreciate that some will view this as an OPEC forecast, dispute the numbers, and state that the Organization is against renewables.

​Firstly, let me say that many OPEC Member Countries have great sources of solar and wind, and we are seeing huge investments being made in this field. And secondly, we do not see any reputable outlook projecting that renewables will come anywhere close to overtaking oil and gas in the decades ahead.

​We welcome the development of renewables.

​From the perspective of electric vehicles, there is also no doubt that they will continue to see expansion in the transportation sector. We see this in our WOO with the share of electric vehicles in the total road transportation fleet projected to expand to around 13% in 2040. Again, we support their development in a sustainable manner.

​However, for many of the world’s population, it is clear that no matter which way you look at electric vehicles they do not offer a viable alternative to the internal combustion engine due to cost. Moreover, there is also a debate about how environmentally friendly they are considering the build process for them, especially the batteries, as well as where the electricity is sourced from.

​Here, I think it is also relevant to highlight one key detail from our WOO. In the period to 2040, fuel efficiency improvements are expected to result in a far greater reduction in oil demand, than the increasing penetration of alternative fuel vehicles.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​To put it simply, the basic challenge of the energy transition we face today can be summed up in two questions.

​How can we ensure there is enough supply to meet expected future demand growth?

​And how can this growth be achieved in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment?

​It all points to not limiting ourselves by putting all our eggs in one basket. We need to look for cleaner and more efficient technological solutions everywhere, across all available energies.

​As Bob Dudley, CEO of BP, said at this conference yesterday; when tackling emissions there needs “to be recognition that … there are many paths and we need to pursue them all.”

​At OPEC, we recognize the complexity of the challenge. Complex problems require comprehensive solutions. The oil industry has to be part of the solution; it possesses critical resources and expertise that can help unlock our carbon-free future.

​For oil and gas, the environmental challenge is not oil and gas themselves. It is the emissions that come from burning them.

​We are believers that solutions can be found in technologies, such as Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) and others, that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions. We will need a very broad portfolio of emission removal technologies to tackle climate change.

​We welcome coordinated action within the industry and through various research and development platforms, such as the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI).

​Given what I have just described, we also need to appreciate that policies and lobbying focused on shifting investors away from oil and gas are not the way forward.

​Firstly, as Microsoft co-founder and prominent philanthropist, Bill Gates, said in a recent interview with the Financial Times: “Divestment, to date, probably has reduced about zero tonnes of emissions.”

​And secondly, references to stranded assets and declining values in our industry advances a potentially dangerous scenario where the necessary investments may not be made, one that could increase volatility significantly and lead to a future energy shortfall.

​Moreover, if those billions of people in the developing world that suffer from a lack of energy access feel they are being sidelined from energies that have helped fuel the developed world, then this could sow further divisions and expand the divide between the haves and have nots, the North and the South.

​I am sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say how important funding and investment is in any talk of an energy transition and diversification.

​This was a point referenced unequivocally by Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of Total, at this conference on Tuesday.

​It is vital we have a stable environment and a level playing field; where the focus is not on the energy source, but on reducing emissions.

​From OPEC’s perspective, let me stress that we fully identify with the fact that the foundation for investment, growth and economic diversification can only come through balance and stability in the market.

​OPEC Member Countries remain fully committed to investments across the whole industry value chain, and the issue of returning global investments is a core focus of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, and the recently endorsed ‘Charter of Cooperation’.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​I am often asked, what the best way forward is when you look at the plethora of opinions and divergent viewpoints about the future energy transition.

​I cannot say I have all the answers; no one does. And if anyone says they do; then I might have to politely say they may not be telling the truth.

​What I can say is that OPEC, and I am sure the entire oil and gas industry, welcomes dialogue with all stakeholders; and welcomes action too.

​It was the British philosopher, Bertrand Russell, who once said: “The only thing that will redeem (hu)mankind is cooperation.”

​We can no longer work in silos; we can no longer see our futures in polarized terms.

​We need to ensure sustainable growth, development and prosperity for ourselves, for our children and for our children’s children.

​And we need to stress that the scale of the climate challenge means that no single energy source is a panacea; nor can the contribution of an entire industry or group of countries be overlooked.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/83-10-october-2019.html"
"2019-09-30","​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Dobh-reyh dehyn

​It is a great pleasure to be here at the 16th Annual Meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, in the great city of Sochi. I would like to sincerely thank the Valdai Club for inviting me to speak and my friend HE Alexander Novak, who insisted that I attend. I would also like to commend all involved who have succeeded in making the Valdai Conference one of the leading international events in the world; a must-attend event in everyone’s calendar.

​When I consider today’s distinguished line-up of speakers and, indeed, all of the prestigious contributors in the years since the Valdai Discussion Club was established in 2004, I am humbled and honoured to be amongst them.

​On a personal note, I am a keen fan of all sports and, of course, Sochi is synonymous with prominent sporting events. I recall watching with rapt attention the Winter Olympics in 2014 and several of the football World Cup games in 2018. Yesterday, we watched together the Formula One World Championship at the Sochi Autodrom, already the sixth one held here.

​More importantly, when I spoke to anybody who attended the Olympics, the World Cup games or other international events in Sochi; they all unanimously spoke about the same thing: the gracious hospitality and warm welcome they received from the Russian people.

​And as someone who has been fortunate enough to be a regular visitor of this great country, such reviews came as no surprise to me!

​We are currently in the midst of an historic era for OPEC-Russian relations. Our partnership has evolved into a permanent, transformative force-for-good in the energy market; one that has had a profoundly positive effect on the industry and the global economy.

​What has been the secret behind this success? Well, the answer to that can be encapsulated by the famous saying of the legendary Russian military leader, Alexander Suvorov:

​“Sincerity in relations, truth in communication ̶ that is friendship.”

​The OPEC-Russian relationship is one based on friendship and mutual respect. At OPEC, we have tremendous respect for the Russian Federation; its status as one of the top producers of oil; the important leadership role it plays in international affairs and the enormous contribution generations of Russian scientists, artists, writers, musicians and poets have made to shaping human civilization.

​This respect obviously applies to how we at OPEC view Russia’s leaders. I am referring of course to the President of this great country: HE Vladimir Putin. Our Organization has been infinitely enriched from our association and cooperation with President Putin.

​The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between OPEC Member Countries and 10 non-OPEC producing countries, led by Russia, which came into force on 1 January 2017, resuscitated the fortunes of the global oil industry. President Putin has been one of the key architects and authors of making this endeavour a success. A crucial milestone which set in motion the chain of events which resulted in the “Declaration of Cooperation,’ was the “breaking of the ice” meeting that President Putin had with His Highness Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, on the margins of the 2016 G20 Hangzhou Summit, held on the 4th and 5th September, in China. This courageous step, particularly the warm rapport that President Putin developed with the Crown Prince, has played an immense role in our subsequent successes.

​President Putin’s support was also critical in ensuring that the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ was signed on 2 July 2019, something I will return to later in my remarks.

​We have been very fortunate that President Putin appointed one of the ablest minds in the industry as Russia’s Minister of Energy, a fine example of his impeccable judgement. I speak, of course, of HE Alexander Novak, who throughout this entire process, especially in his role as Alternate Chairman of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, and co-chair of the OPEC and Non-OPEC Ministerial Conference has been a pillar of sound decision making, knowledge and exceptionally good instincts.

​As the productive partnership between OPEC and the Russian Federation has intensified over the last three years, HE Novak has conducted himself with the utmost professionalism, dignity and statesmanship. This has earned him the respect of his peers and admiration of all who have worked with him. He has been a tremendous asset to the entire ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ enterprise, not only through his leadership role within the non-OPEC partners but also in forging consensus among OPEC Member Countries. Indeed, he is widely viewed as the reliable and dependable bridge between OPEC and non-OPEC ̶ an ‘umbilical cord’ binding this great initiative.

​I have spoken at length about this friendship between OPEC and Russia because I believe it is the answer to the question posed in the title of this session: “How to avoid instability and ensure a balance of interests?”

​The challenges which this industry faces are inherently complex. No single stakeholder possesses all of the answers or, indeed, knows all of the questions. It is only through working together that we can hope to surmount the obstacles we face.

​We saw this in the severe downturn which beset the industry between 2014 and 2016. The collapse in commodity prices pushed many developing countries to the verge of recession. Our industry was in dire straits. The oil market went into sharp disequilibrium when a rampant world supply surge of 5.5 mb/d significantly overtook the oil demand increase of 4.1 mb/d. By July 2016, OECD commercial stock overhang reached a record high of about 403 mb over the five-year industry average. The OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016.

​Nearly one trillion dollars in investments were either frozen or discontinued, and a record number of companies in our industry filed for bankruptcy. According to the consulting firm Graves & Co., almost half a million jobs were lost in the global oil and gas industry.

​There were initial talks in Doha I (16 February 2016 among Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and The Russian Federation), and Doha II (17 April 2016 among all OPEC Member Countries except IR Iran, and Non-OPEC countries comprising of The Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Oman, Mexico, and Trinidad and Tobago).

​Russia and OPEC knew that in the face of this crisis, action must be taken. Hence, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ was signed on the 10th December 2016. This action reversed the downturn and contributed to an improvement in the health of the global economy in 2017 and 2018.

​Together, we embarked on a remarkable journey over the last three years; one which has served the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy. We decided to further build on this cooperation through the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ which was endorsed at the 6th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, on the 2nd of July 2019.

​The ‘Charter’ is a platform to facilitate dialogue among the Participating Countries, aiming to promote oil market stability, cooperation in technology and other areas, for the benefit of oil producers, consumers, investors and the global economy. It is a means of enabling the long-term use of oil as a key component in the evolving global energy mix, as well as improving the environmental and efficiency credentials of oil. The ‘Charter’ will promote strategies and technologies to advance the global oil industry.

​Our 24 participating countries of the DoC have chosen the path of cooperation; the path of dialogue, the path of transparency and openness. The ‘Charter’ crystalizes these intentions and provides them with an overall framework.

​The ‘Charter’ can steer us through challenges we may face in the future. This is especially apparent given the fact that our industry is often vulnerable to external shocks beyond the capacity of any one stakeholder to control: geopolitics; trade tensions; monetary policy; natural disasters and other factors. However, the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ is a sturdy ship, which can navigate these tempestuous waters.

​Therefore, further and more intensified cooperation is the best prescription to treat volatility. For this reason, participation in the ‘Charter’ is voluntary and open to all producing countries. I would like to extend the hand of friendship to all 97 oil producing countries and invite them to join the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ as we seek to build a better world.

​I also believe the ‘Charter of Cooperation’ reflects a trend in the energy sphere which is being mirrored in other developments in international politics. This June, the UN Secretary General’s Panel on Digital Cooperation, released a report entitled “The Age of Digital Interdependence.” It sought to advance global multi-stakeholder dialogue on how we can work better together to realize the potential of digital technologies for advancing human well-being while mitigating the risks.

​One very notable conclusion from the report was its forecast that multilateralism will increase in importance in the coming decades and this will be complemented by, something which the Committee termed ‘multi-stakeholderism.’

​The ‘Charter of Cooperation’ embodies the concept of ‘multi-stakeholderism’ in the energy sphere. It encompasses broad and inclusive dialogue among producers, consumers, investors and other relevant counterparts in the global economy. The importance of such movements was articulated by the genius Russian author, Leo Tolstoy when he said,

​“To be true friends, you need to be confident in each other.”

​Recent events in the energy industry have underscored the fact that unexpected developments can have a dramatic impact on market fundamentals. This only underscores the need for continued cooperation. I would like to conclude by recalling the words of the Russian poet, Osip Mandelstam:

​“Friendship is similar to treasure: you cannot draw more than you invested.”

​On behalf of the entire OPEC family, I would like to thank the Russian Federation for our partnership and friendship.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/84-30-september-2019.html"
"2019-09-26","​Excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is my great pleasure to be here in the beautiful capital city of Nur-Sultan on the occasion of Kazakhstan Energy Week to participate in this 12th Kazenergy Eurasian Forum.

​Allow me to first recognize the Prime Minister of Kazakhstan, His Excellency, Askar Mamin. On behalf of OPEC, allow me to thank you for your excellent leadership and loyal support of Kazakhstan’s active and effective participation in the OPEC-Non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation, the DoC. I am also extremely grateful for the immense contributions of your predecessors: His Excellency, Bakhytzhan Sagintayev and His Excellency, Karim Massimov. These skilled and able statesmen were highly supportive of Kazakhstan’s participation in the consultations that led to the monumental Ministerial decisions, and then eventually the implementation phase of the DoC. Mr. Prime Minister, OPEC looks forward to your ongoing contributions as, together, we seek to forge a lasting stability in the global oil market.

​Finally, I would like to thank His Excellency, Kanat Bozumbayev, Minister of Energy, for the invitation to take part here at this important event, and for his dedicated efforts as a participating non-OPEC member of the DoC. I congratulate you and the Organizing Committee on the very impressive and wide-ranging program you have put together for this week-long event, which has risen in stature to become one of the top global industry gatherings.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​This city, formerly known as Astana, was renamed in March of this year to honour Kazakhstan’s first President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who faithfully served this country from 1990 until March of this year. The renaming of the capital city was a fitting gesture for this founding father, a visionary leader who brought this nation through nearly three decades of steady development and progress.

​He was a staunch advocate for unity and cooperation, which he knew were only possible through peace and dialogue.

​He once said, and I quote: “We have to acknowledge peace is in danger and mankind still has not realized the priority to be given to world dialogue versus armed conflict and bloodshed.”

​No matter one’s background or heritage, he knew that together, we are stronger.

​He has said, quote: “Interethnic and spiritual accord is our strategic resource, the basis for progress of our society and state.”

​This great leader repeatedly throughout his illustrious career sowed the seeds of collaboration and dialogue, and now those seeds are blossoming through Kazakhstan’s participation on the international stage through the DoC and CoC.

​Nazarbayev’s legacy is evident today when you drive through this metropolis of just over 1 million people and witness a truly magnificent cityscape with gleaming skyscrapers dotting the horizon. It is indeed a living tribute to the advancements this country has achieved over the years.

​This impressive progress of today is rooted in Kazakhstan’s rich history of intellectual thought and scholarship.

​10th century Kazakh scholar and intellectual Abu Nasr Al-Farabi is widely regarded as a leading philosopher in the Islamic world. His works in various fields, including religion and science, have influenced, among others, Avicenna, Averroes and Maimonides, who followed in his footsteps. A leading founder of Peripatetic philosophy in the East, he became known as “The Second Teacher” after Aristotle.

​Al-Farabi has had such an impact on this country and its culture that Kazakhstan named its leading university after him. The Al-Farabi Kazakh National University is the leading institution of higher education in Kazakhstan and the first to be certified to offer a full range of academic studies. This impressive institution is cultivating the top talent in Kazakhstan and continues to provide its oil and gas industry with the high-quality staff it needs for the future.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The success story of which I speak would not have come to be without Kazakhstan’s rich blessings of mineral resources, which it has effectively developed to propel this country forward to become a leading economy in the region of Eurasia.

​I think the delegates here today are very aware of this country’s rich past, with more than 120 years of experience in the oil industry!

​With massive investments in its energy sector, Kazakhstan is now seeing the fruits of its labour as major projects, such as the giant Kashagan field and the equally impressive Tengizchevoil project, are helping provide significant boosts in liquids production capacity, thereby ensuring security of supply to the market. This is just the ‘tip of the iceberg’, though, and I am certain there are still many chapters to be written in the ongoing success story of this country.

​Excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​Over the past few months, the global oil market has been plagued by uncertainty, due mainly to ongoing trade disputes, softening demand and geopolitical developments. This prevailing uncertainty was aggravated further with the recent attacks on the Abqaiq facility and Khurais oil field in Saudi Arabia. In a matter of minutes, an estimated 5.7 mb/d of crude oil production were taken off the market. In the immediate aftermath, the oil price jumped by more than 18%, the highest volatility in 30 years!

​The rapid response from the Government of Saudi Arabia and Saudi Aramco to restore production as quickly as possible was absolutely essential in calming the market’s fears of extended volatility. I commend Minister of Energy, HRH Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, for his swift action in responding to this unprecedented attack. He has also vowed that Saudi Arabia will maintain its production levels as agreed at the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee meeting on 12 September in the UAE.

​Let me emphasize here that any disruption to the steady and secure supply of oil and gas products anywhere in the world is counterproductive and detrimental to the industry and to the wider global economy. OPEC is firmly committed to market stability and remains a dependable, reliable source of supply for its customers worldwide.

​Excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​Another pressing issue in our industry right now is climate change. The 74th Session of the United Nations General Assembly is meeting this week in New York City and this topic is high atop the agenda.

​In fact, UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has convened a Climate Summit under the theme ‘Climate Action Summit 2019: A Race We Can Win. A Race We Must Win.’ The goal of the Summit is to mobilize high-level political and economic support to advance implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

​The outcomes of this Summit will feed into the UNFCCC process by contributing to the 25th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 25) to the UNFCCC in December 2019.

​Today, I would like to urge you to consider the facts. On November 5th, we will publish the 2019 World Oil Outlook which presents our long-term forecast for the oil and gas industry. This, and every other publication we produce, is based on rigorous research and analysis, not on theories.

​And our research tells us that oil and gas, and this industry as a whole, are here to stay.

​The fact is, all forms of energy will be required to meet future demand; it is not about choosing one form of energy over another. Oil and gas are expected to remain the fuels with the largest share in the energy mix throughout the forecast period to 2040.

​We also expect to see robust growth in long-term global oil demand, which is expected to rise to almost 112 mb/d by 2040. Most of this will come from developing countries with high population growth rates, expanding middle classes and strong economic growth.

​Another notion I want to dispel is that electric vehicles are on the verge of replacing conventional vehicles. This is simply inaccurate. Our research tells us that although the rate for new sales of electric vehicles is very high, the share of the total stock in 2017 was only 0.3% and 1.3% of total vehicle sales. We will see the long-term share of electric vehicles in the total fleet reach a level of around 13% by 2040, but conventional vehicles will still see the majority of growth of the total vehicle fleet.

​And finally, let us not underestimate the vital role of technological innovation, energy and fuel efficiency enhancements and carbon capture, utilization and storage, which will provide a balanced and effective approach to meeting the world’s energy needs in an environmentally friendly way.

​Delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​To make headway in any of these areas I have just outlined, we must have the full cooperation and support of ALL industry stakeholders.

​The participating producers of the Declaration of Cooperation, in which Kazakhstan continues to play a key role, have created the blueprint for effective international energy cooperation. So, let us now go forth and build upon this through the Charter of Cooperation, which was endorsed at the 6th OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 2 July 2019. The Charter is an extension of the highly successful Declaration of Cooperation, providing a permanent platform for discussion and cooperation.

​In this regard, I again want to express my sincere appreciation to the government of Kazakhstan for its extremely valuable contributions and loyal participation. We look forward to working closely with you in the years to come.

​I wish you all a highly successful week of meetings.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/85-26-september-2019.html"
"2019-09-14","Deputy Prime Minister Thamir Abbas Al-Ghadhban, Professor Sayigh, Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, 

It is once again an honour and a privilege for me to return to Baghdad and participate at the Fifth Iraq Energy Forum and share the floor with such an outstanding group of leaders. I listened with rapt attention to HE Al-Ghadhban. 

I would like to commend the Government of the Republic of Iraq, particularly the Ministries of Oil, Electricity and Water Resources; the Iraq Energy Institute ably guided by the IEI Board Chairman, Professor Ali Sayigh; and all members of the organizing team for preparing such an outstanding forum. The Iraq Energy Forum has evolved into one of the most reputable events in the energy calendar; a ‘must-attend’ for industry stakeholders every year. 

I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been a guest in this great nation on several occasions during my professional career. It is always an honour to be here, as Iraq truly is the ‘cradle of civilization.’

This is a nation of firsts: the place where the concept of the wheel first took hold; where the first agriculture appeared; where the first system of irrigation was developed; an area where the oldest surviving form of writing hails from; where the first cities were settled. 

The enormity of these innovations are mind-boggling in that they fundamentally shaped our subsequent human existence but are also the testimony to the enduring genius of the people who lived here, the people of Iraq. For millennia, Iraq has been home to civilizations that have left their mark on the region and the world: the Sumerians, the Akkadians, the Babylonians and the Assyrians, to name but a few. 

Given this litany of extraordinary firsts and the fact Iraq is the source and origin of civilization; you can understand why it is with tremendous pride that OPEC can say that our Organization was also born in this prestigious nation! And today is our birthday! OPEC is 59 years young! 

Between the 10th and 14th of September 1960, representatives from five courageous oil producing countries descended on Al-Shaab Hall in the Bab Al-Muaatham district in Baghdad: Fuad Rouhani of Iran; Dr. Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq; Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait; Abdullah Al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia; and Dr. Juan Pablo Perez Alfonzo of Venezuela. As a result of the actions of these five founding fathers, visionary leaders of our Member Countries, OPEC came into existence. 

Much has been written about the founding of OPEC and its significance, but in the interests of time this morning, I would highlight two particular legacies which are particularly relevant in our present times. 

With the benefit of hindsight, we might have the impression that the foundation of OPEC was inevitable, however, that was not the case. The Organization’s Founder Members each arrived in Baghdad with different objectives, expectations and priorities. Yet, the founders recognized that common interests outweighed any differences they may have had; that working together will always yield greater results than going alone and unity is a source of strength. 

These ideals are as relevant in 2019 as they were in 1960; they are truly timeless and have served as a stable lynchpin throughout our history. The founding of our Organization is an outcome of cooperation, dialogue and compromise; and this has been clearly apparent in every success we have enjoyed in the subsequent 59 years. 

Secondly, OPEC was founded in strict accordance with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter. The Treaty establishing OPEC was later registered at the UN Secretariat on 6 November 1961. Our Organization has always been proud of its close association with the UN and our role in the multilateral system. 

Aside from being the site of our Organization’s birth, it is no coincidence that Iraq is a Founder Member of OPEC. This spirit of commitment to OPEC’s pursuit of sustainable oil market stability has been exemplified by the current leadership of Iraq. Iraq has strongly supported the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process. This unique initiative has seen OPEC join hands with 10 non-OPEC Member Countries to work together in bringing more balance to the market. 

Not only did Iraq play an important role in brokering consensus among the 24 partners, it has also backed words with actions. This year, Iraq, ably represented by HE Al-Ghadhban, became a member of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee and has made a critical contribution to the vital monitoring mission of this body. We just returned from Abu Dhabi together with HE Al-Ghadhban, where we attended the 16th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee under the new chairmanship of HRH Prince Abdulaziz Bin-Salman of Saudi Arabia. The meeting was very productive, and all participating countries were unequivocal in providing steadfast assurances of their determination to achieve at least full conformity with their voluntary productions adjustments. 

We are delighted that Iraq has continued to demonstrate its commitment through its steadfast support of the ‘Charter of Cooperation,’ which was endorsed at the 6th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, held on the second of July 2019. This ‘once in a lifetime’ document provides an institutional framework for the cooperation between OPEC and our non-OPEC partners, facilitating dialogue among stakeholders in the interest of producers, consumers and the global economy. I am delighted, yet unsurprised, to say that Iraq was the first country to ratify the ‘Charter.’

Ladies and gentlemen, 

Returning to the city which birthed OPEC, inevitably leads one to reflect on the history of the oil industry and the factors which connect our past with the present. Re-examining the annals of history, one cannot help but be struck by the perseverance of a belief held by some prominent voices, namely: the notion of an impending collapse of oil. 

These ideas have sometimes been collectively categorized as the ‘concept of peak oil,’ and denote the notion that oil supply was on the verge of a long term decline. 

Most famously it was outlined by M. King Hubbert in 1956 and Matthew Simmons in 2005, but in truth, when one scours sources from even the nineteenth century, from the moment oil was first drilled for commercial purposes in Baku, Azerbaijan in 1846, people were forecasting that as oil was a finite resource, production would eventually stop. The idea was particularly in vogue in the middle of the 2000s, when countless articles, books, studies and media analysis described an impending oil supply shortage.

Significantly, predictions of the end of oil have impacted financial markets, affected investment decisions and caused consternation for policy makers. This reinforces the point that sentiment, speculation and rumours have played important roles as market drivers, often causing a disconnect between prices and market fundamentals. 

Yet, primarily due to technological innovation, the idea of peak supply has not materialized. As Dan Yergin phrased it:

The general history of the oil and gas industry…is of technological advance. New technologies are developed to identify new resources and to produce more from existing fields.

A particularly fascinating development in this current decade is that the concept of what ‘peak oil’ means has shifted. At the beginning of the 2010s, reports of peak supply were almost omnipresent; however, we are about to conclude the decade when this purported ‘worry’ has shifted to concerns about ‘peak demand.’

Pick up a newspaper today or read an article online and one of the most common refrains is that demand for oil is about to plateau or decline. Such thinking has been heavily influenced by advocates of renewable energy and the electric-car lobby, who champion the idea that hydrocarbons are on the verge of being replaced by renewable forms of energy. 

While I would not diminish some of the important arguments and valid points which both proponents of peak supply and peak demand have made, one cannot help but recognize common traits to both views. They both contain a degree of what Blake Clayton described as ‘irrational anxiety.’ Peak demand fears do not necessarily reflect market fundamentals or the overwhelming majority of long-term forecasts of most reporting agencies. 

So to all stakeholders in the oil industry, particularly the investment community and policy makers; I wish to make an appeal: do not let your views on the oil industry be determined by the loudest voices; the overreactions or the excessively bullish or bearish. 

Instead, look at the facts; focus on the fundamentals. And when looking at the fundamentals, in both the short-term and long-term, it is clear that the future of this industry is bright. 

In the long term, as OPEC’s flagship publication the World Oil Outlook has shown, world oil demand is set to grow considerably in the future. Long-term oil demand is expected to rise to almost 112 mb/d by 2040. This will be primarily driven by developing countries: their expanding middle class, high population growth rates and strong economic potential. 

Looking at the road transportation sector and the idea that electric vehicles are about to replace conventional vehicles; it should be noted, that according to our WOO, although the rate for new sales of electric vehicles is very high, the share in total stock in 2017 was just 0.3% and 1.3% of total vehicle sales. 

While the long-term share of electric vehicles in the total fleet is projected to expand and reach a level of around 13% by 2040, conventional vehicles will constitute the majority of growth of the total vehicle fleet. For example, ICE vehicles are expected to maintain their dominant share of new commercial vehicle sales over the forecast period. Although their share declines from 96% in 2017 to 81% by 2040, this still constitutes an overwhelming majority. 

Furthermore, just as technological innovation defied the ‘peak supply’ prognosis, I believe it will play a pivotal role in assuaging ‘peak demand’ concerns. Many link the fate of future of demand with concern regarding the environmental credentials of oil. Technological innovation, particularly energy efficiency improvements, fuel efficiency standards and carbon capture and storage offer promising avenues to reconciling the conflicting components of the energy trilemma. 

Unfortunately, energy poverty remains a scourge of our time. The total number of people with access to electricity is just below one billion. Three billion people still lack access to clean fuels for cooking. An energy transition should not forget these realities and we should strive for a more inclusive world – where every person has access to energy. 

With regard to market prospects in the immediate term, market fundamentals remain solid. While challenges to global economic growth remain, particularly within the sphere of trade-related tensions, the DoC partners have repeatedly demonstrated, through words and deeds, their unwavering commitment to taking whatever action necessary in pursuit of sustainable oil market stability. The figures tell a compelling story: in August conformity with the voluntary production adjustments was 136% and has averaged 121% per month since the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ was signed.

Ladies and gentlemen, 

Next year, in this great city, we will commemorate one of the most unlikely stories in world history. In the face of the resistance from some of the most powerful stakeholders on earth, a small group of developing nations came together to courageously assert their legitimate sovereignty over their natural resources. Who could have imagined that 59 years later, despite many momentous events in the interim, this group would expand and reach out the hand of friendship to 10 non-OPEC partners, under the umbrella of the ‘Charter of Cooperation.’ 

Committed to the principles of fairness, transparency and equity, this group has evolved from a noble vision to a permanent, transformative force-for-good – one that has had a profoundly positive impact on the global oil industry. 

At OPEC, we respect our origins and our history. For this reason, we are eternally grateful to the people of Iraq, for everything they have done for our Organization. Every OPEC Secretary General is a citizen of Iraq. So I am proud to be one.

We would therefore like to thank the people and Government of Iraq for their gracious invitation to commemorate the 60 year anniversary of OPEC’s founding next year, here in Baghdad. This will allow all Member Countries to return to the Organization’s roots and undertake several important tasks. 

Finally, the 60 year anniversary commemorative celebrations will allow us to take a holistic stock of the tumultuous journey our Organization has been on and travel down memory lane. From the moment of its conception, many did not think OPEC had a chance of survival. Yet over the last six decades, OPEC’s relevance has only increased with each passing year. 

Throughout our history we have faced our share of challenges and we have learned many lessons along the road. We have survived six oil market cycles on this incredible journey. Despite all the highs and lows, peaks and troughs, we have remained dedicated to unity, transparency and equity. It is important that we come together in Baghdad to discuss and analyze these ‘lessons learned.’ 

The 60 year anniversary will also serve another critical purpose. Reflecting on our past, we will draw a roadmap for the next 60 years ahead, demonstrating our staying power in a fast changing energy landscape. We will extrapolate how the principles which guided our Founding Fathers can be repurposed for the decades ahead. 

There can be no doubt, in looking at the way ahead; Iraq will continue to be critical in all our endeavours. We will once again look to this great nation, to summon the wisdom, inspired leadership, courage and fortitude which have made Iraq an integral, invaluable and pivotal member of our OPEC family, to guide us on the way ahead. 

Allow me to once again thank our gracious Iraqi hosts and wish us all a successful forum.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/86-14-september-2019.html"
"2019-09-12","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​I would like to begin by thanking our Emirati hosts, who once again have afforded this committee the most outstanding generosity and gracious hospitality. Here in Abu Dhabi, one truly feels at home. This is also indicative of the steadfast support which the UAE has given the DoC since its inception.

​I know I speak for all of us when I say that we are honoured and humbled to once again return to the fabled land of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, of blessed memory, and attend meetings of the JTC and JMMC, which, for the second time, are taking place in the great city of Abu Dhabi.

​2019 is the “Year of Tolerance” in the UAE. As His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the current Crown Prince of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi has said,

​“The UAE is a place of tolerance, co-existence and openness to other cultures.”

​These are profound words and we could not agree more. One remarkable Emirati who has embodied these ideals, applying them to our committee and in his role as OPEC Conference President last year, is HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei; someone who continues to be a tremendous asset to this group and has traversed the globe extolling the virtues of the “Declaration of Cooperation” process.

​Your Excellency, thank you for your hospitality and your continued engagement in our noble mission.

​I would also like to add my words of welcome to HE Timipre Sylva, Nigeria’s new Minister of State for Petroleum Resources. This is the Minister’s first meeting since taking up his new assignment and I am sure he will make a terrific contribution to our Committee and our Organization.

​When I consider this unique group of countries participating in the “Declaration of Cooperation;” when I think of this Committee and its able leadership; when I reflect on the common journey we have embarked on together; I am reminded of the quote attributed to the genius 13th century author and philosopher, Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi:

​“Be courageous and discipline yourself. Work. Keep digging your well….Keep knocking and the joy inside will eventually open a window and look out to see who’s there….There’s courage involved if you want to become truth.”

​The DoC took courage. Rather than choose going it alone; we chose cooperation. Rather than giving up when the odds seemed stacked against us; we chose compromise and perseverance. Consistently, we reaffirmed our faith in the principles at the root of the multilateral order: equity, transparency and fairness.

​We have deepened the roots of this Cooperation through the ‘Charter of Cooperation,’ which provides an institutional framework for our continued and intensified dialogue going forward.

​I would like to commend the Chairmen of this distinguished Committee, His Royal Highness Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman, and HE Alexander Novak, for personifying the noble virtues of courage, integrity and professionalism.

​This is the first time we convene under the chairmanship of His Royal Highness; a gentleman who for the past 32 years has consistently been the face of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at OPEC, representing the country in the best possible light; a consummate diplomat, a skilled negotiator, an inspirational leader, and a true oil industry expert.

​His Royal Highness has been instrumental in steering negotiations for the adoption of several landmark OPEC Declarations, acting as Chairman of the Committee that drafted the Solemn Declaration at the Second OPEC Summit which took place in Caracas, Venezuela on 27th and 28th September 2000. He did such an outstanding job in this capacity that he also served as Chairman of the Committee that drafted the Riyadh Declaration at the Third OPEC Summit, which took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on the 17th and 18th November 2007. When OPEC decided to develop a Long-Term Strategy and needed a committee to midwife its birth, we, inevitably, turned to the ever-dependable Prince Abdul Aziz. He is currently one of the three longest serving delegates to OPEC.

​We also recall back in the 1980s, when dialogue between producers and consumers seemed like a pipe-dream, Prince Abdul Aziz was one of its pioneers and champions. Small wonder then that this true visionary midwifed the International Energy Forum.

​In 2015, when the oil market was in depths of one of the worst downturns in its history, His Royal Highness passionately advocated joint action between OPEC and the Russian Federation. The seed which the Prince planted gestated into the Algiers Accord of 28 September 2016, which he co-authored; metamorphosing into the Vienna Agreement of 30 November 2016 and the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ of 10 December 2016; and has now blossomed into the ‘Charter of Cooperation,’ endorsed by 24 countries on 2 July 2019.

​These Declarations, decisions and events are integral to our Organization’s raison d'être and a cherished part of our heritage. Therefore, one can truly say that Prince Abdul Aziz Bin Salman is also part of our heritage, and he will play an indispensable role in our bright future. His appointment came as no surprise to those familiar with his own remarkable journey and was greeted with universal acclaim from all stakeholders, as well as eliciting a positive reaction in the market.

​On behalf of the rest of the Committee and the OPEC Secretariat, allow me to offer our assurances to His Royal Highness that he can count on our unwavering commitment and support as he embarks on the enormous responsibility of his new role. We will render every assistance he may require in his new function.

​Your Royal Highness — you can count on us.

​I would also like to pay tribute and give credit to whom they are due, HE Khalid Al-Falih. We are all conscious of the role which he played in making the DoC process a resounding success. Everyone in the OPEC-plus family owes him a debt of gratitude and the history books will judge him highly and favourably.

​Khalid Al-Falih’s tenure coincided with extraordinary events in the oil industry and was replete with accomplishment: from arresting the free fall in market fundamentals in 2016, to the Algiers Accord, the Vienna Agreement, the DoC and, of course, the ‘Charter of Cooperation.’ I would particularly like to highlight his Presidency of the OPEC Conference in the critically important year of 2017. Such was the strength of his performance that he was recognised with the ‘International Oil Diplomacy Person of the Year 2017’ Award at the Energy Institute’s International Petroleum (IP) Week.

​Navigating the first year of implementing our production adjustments was an arduous challenge, but it was one which Khalid Al-Falih rose to admirably. The ultimate testament to his skills, diplomatic tact and commitment is the fact that monthly conformity levels with the voluntary adjustments in production averaged an astonishing 107% throughout 2017, a level unprecedented in the history of our Organization. He applied the same vigour, rigour and commitment following his appointment as Chairman of the JMMC from January 2018.

​Throughout this momentous journey, Khalid Al-Falih demonstrated a mastery of the oil market; astute diplomatic skill and the art of statecraft. His focus on our common goal, namely the urgent restoration of market stability, was unwavering. He demonstrated Saudi Arabia’s firm commitment by ensuring that its high conformity with our voluntary production adjustments remained sacrosanct. As traders would say, “his word is his bond.” He was persistent, yet flexible and adaptable.

​The old adage tells us that: “Courage is the foundation of integrity”. Khalid Al-Falih has both in abundance.

​On behalf of the entire OPEC plus, we wish him all the best in his future endeavours.

​Allow me to conclude by once again, sincerely thanking our Emirati hosts and I wish us all a successful meeting.

​Thank you for your kind attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/87-12-september-2019.html"
"2019-08-28","​Good afternoon.

​It is a great honour to welcome Ban Ki-moon, former UN Secretary General, to the OPEC Secretariat.

​Mr Ban is an extraordinary man whose dedication to the UN’s mission of preventing conflict, peace-making, improving human welfare and fostering sustainable development will be long remembered throughout the international community.

​His tireless work to advance cooperation among nations during his two terms as Secretary General, from 2007 to 2016, overlap our own goals at OPEC as demonstrated most clearly through our enduring efforts to support sustainable development by helping to ensure oil market stability.

​I had the great privilege to be Chairman of the OPEC Task Force at the 15th Session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development that took place shortly after His Excellency became Secretary General in 2007. I have great personal admiration for him, and deeply respect his expert diplomacy and mastery of the craft of statesmanship.

​Our paths also crossed regularly at the annual UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP Meetings, of which Mr. Ban never missed one during his ten-year tenure as UN Secretary General. This is something to be lauded. He was resolutely dedicated to environmental and sustainable development issues, and his active participation at these meetings was welcomed by all.

​It was a common sight to see him walking the floors, joining meetings, engaging in detailed discussions at all hours of the day to help bring about better understanding between all the Parties. He could help ease tensions, broker consensus, and pave the way for convergence and accord.

​Looking back at Mr Ban’s achievements as Secretary General, it is not easy to put them into a few words. Allow me to single out a few, starting with the adoption in 2015 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Mr Ban’s successful leadership throughout this process is a credit to his diplomatic skills and commitment to developing an achievable framework through a transparent and participatory process.

​Mr Ban also launched the Sustainable Energy for All initiative as a multi-stakeholder approach to end energy poverty as outlined in SDG 7. OPEC embraced the inclusion of energy poverty in the SDGs and champions the use of a mix of energy resources to alleviate this blight on society, which in turn can lead to broader improvements in health, education, social welfare and economic opportunity in developing regions.

​A further achievement under Mr Ban’s leadership was the Paris Agreement, which builds on the UNFCCC. This agreement provides the opportunity to address climate challenges in a fair and meaningful way, and affirms the value of international dialogue and cooperation. To borrow from Mr Ban’s own words about the Paris Agreement:

​“We must remember that our work is not done yet. Indeed, the Paris Agreement is only the starting point. We need to continue to galvanize further climate action and elevate collective efforts to implement the Paris Agreement.”

​I could not agree more. As I stated at the UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice last December, the oil industry must be part of the solution to the climate change challenge. We also believe that “there is no Planet B” and that we must all be responsible citizens as we go forward.

​Mr. Ban in his role as UN Secretary General, alongside the World Bank, also launched the ‘Zero Routine Flaring by 2030’ initiative in April 2015, with the participation of a coalition of governments, oil companies and development institutions. Some of OPEC Member Countries and their oil companies are participating in this vital initiative.

​Finally, I am very proud to welcome the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens as a new neighbour in Vienna. Founded less than two years ago and co-chaired by Mr Ban and former Austrian President Heinz Fischer, the Centre works within the SDG framework to empower women and young people so they can thrive as global citizens and leaders. We welcome this initiative and look forward to a long and collaborative relationship with you here in Vienna and around the world.

​Let me say to Mr Ban, the world still needs you. Your humility and dedication to service remains vital in a world that is today often consumed by risk and discord; one where we see the threat of a breakdown of international institutions and the global order.

​From the whole Organization that is OPEC, thank you for your on-going work on behalf of the international community. We hope it continues for many years to come.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/88-28-august-2019.html"
"2019-08-28","​Ladies and gentlemen,

​It is a pleasure to be at the OPEC Secretariat and to have this opportunity to speak with you all today. I would like to thank the Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, for the kind invitation to come to this great institution.

​In my remarks this afternoon, I would like to cover the ways in which OPEC can continue to support the multilateral system and make a significant contribution to addressing the challenges of our time.

​Firstly, I would note the strong complementarity between the work of OPEC and the UN. Next year, OPEC will commemorate the 60th anniversary of its founding in Baghdad on the 14th of September 1960. This Organization came into being as a result of the joint action by several UN Member Countries. The Treaty establishing OPEC was registered at the UN Secretariat on 6 November 1962. Three years later, OPEC also established formal relations with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in 1965.

​OPEC has always sought to undertake its activities in strict conformity with the UN’s principles and purposes. Indeed, the OPEC Secretariat has been a regular participant in meetings of various institutions and agencies of the UN, particularly the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

​Over the years, OPEC has actively participated in UN sponsored climate change negotiations, particularly through its observer status at the ‘Conference of the Parties’ to the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change. I know Mr. Barkindo has been a veteran of these negotiations. As leader of Nigeria’s technical delegation to the UN climate change negotiations since 1991, Mr Barkindo contributed to producing the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol. He served as Chair of the Group of 77 and China at the UNFCCC and was elected to serve three terms as Vice President of the Conference of the Parties – COP13 (Bali, Indonesia), COP14 (Poznan, Poland) and COP15 (Copenhagen, Denmark), where he chaired the opening session attended by more than 100 heads of state and government.

​Clearly, OPEC is an intergovernmental organization which takes the principles of multilateralism seriously. And this has been seen in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ and ‘Charter of Cooperation’ that you have agreed with 10 non-OPEC oil producing countries. Under this initiative, twenty four countries have come together to work for sustainable oil market stability in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy.

​We live in a world where the concept of multilateralism is under attack. However, the long experience of the UN and OPEC has shown that the peoples of the world stand to gain more by working together, respecting all nations, under a rules-based order. Therefore, I encourage you to continue your outreach activities. Keep working with others and strengthen the relationships you already have. Listen to consumers. Promote dialogue. Respect all points of view. Reach consensus. These goals underpin your ‘Charter of Cooperation’ and I am particularly pleased of your commitment, under the Charter, to intensify efforts on “improving the environmental credentials” of this industry, a theme which I will return to later.

​I am also very aware, from my many years of working at the UN Secretariat, that an organization is only as good as its staff. At the UN, I was always inspired by the dedication and talent of our tremendous staff. Talent management is of pivotal importance to any organization. I am sure that is no different here.

​I therefore make an appeal to all managers here to value talented staff and prioritize staff welfare. Create an environment which allows them to fulfil their potential. Promote diversity and inclusivity.

​On this issue, there is enormous potential for streamlining the efforts of the UN and OPEC with regard to Human Resource issues. I would encourage your relevant experts to remain in close contact with the UN’s International Civil Service Commission (ICSC). The ICSC has performed studies, produced analytical papers and made recommendations on policies and practices related to talent management, which I am sure would be of interest here.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​It was a great honour for me to launch the Sustainable Energy for All initiative in 2011. Subsequently, SEforALL has evolved into an international organization working with leaders in government, the private sector and civil society to drive further, faster action toward achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), which calls for universal access to sustainable energy by 2030, and the Paris Agreement, which calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit climate warming to below 2° Celsius.

​We should never forget that energy poverty remains a scourge of our time. Nearly one billion people worldwide do not have access to electricity. Around 3 billion people do not have access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.

​Meeting the growing need for transport infrastructure and services, particularly in the developing world, and protecting vulnerable populations from extreme heat through cooling, in a sustainable manner is not straightforward. However, I believe energy efficiency and technological innovation will be critical in this regard. The oil industry can demonstrate its recognition that there is ‘no planet B’ by supporting energy efficiency policies and providing financial backing to such measures.

​I am aware that OPEC is keen to further facilitate dialogue and information exchange on this topic. I hope the Organization will prioritize energy efficiency as a means of unlocking our carbon free future.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Ours is a complex world and the solutions to the problems which the globe faces are not simple. We need comprehensive responses, which involve all stakeholders of goodwill. I think OPEC should take pride in its role in the multilateral system and continue to work closely with the UN. Above all, I hope the Organization can recommit itself to addressing the climate challenge. Undoubtedly, there are expertise here which can help us build a better future. Allow me to offer my assurances that the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens stands ready to act as partner in your pursuance of this noble goal.

​Thank you for your kind attention and best of luck to all of you in your future endeavours.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/89-28-august-2019.html"
"2019-07-02","​Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​Buenos dias a todos; good morning to all.

​In the name of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and on behalf of all participating countries of the Declaration of Cooperation, it is my pleasure to welcome you all to the 6th OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

​This is the first occasion in my capacity as President of the OPEC Conference to preside over this Meeting, and it is my honour to have the opportunity to do so.

​I especially appreciate this Meeting as it is a living and visible testimony of our international cooperation that was forged through the path-breaking Declaration of Cooperation. Though we collaborate throughout the year from afar, it is just magnificent to see the OPEC and non-OPEC delegations gathered here together under one roof and unified in one spirit.

​I am also delighted to welcome a few additional non-OPEC producers attending today, including Niger, South Africa and representatives from the African Petroleum Producers Organization.

​I would like to acknowledge and thank my Co-Chair for this meeting, His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, as well as His Excellency Khalid Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Chairman of the JMMC; And last, but certainly not least, my fellow comrade, OPEC Secretary General, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo. The undying commitment and fierce loyalty displayed by these gentlemen throughout this process have been key to helping us restore balance and stability to the oil market. Indeed, these are men of “timber and caliber”, a fitting expression that my comrade from Nigeria, the Secretary General, shared with me to describe this type of strong and capable leadership.

​The clear success of this unprecedented energy cooperation has attracted much interest, not only within our industry, but among the global media and other energy stakeholders across the world. I would like to emphasize here that this framework for cooperation remains open to all oil producers interested in joining our efforts to help maintain a balanced oil market and a sustainable stability.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Before we proceed with our deliberations, I would like to take a moment and reflect on the very significant and noble achievements we have made since the beginning of our cooperation back in January 2017. Thanks to your loyal support and active contributions, we have achieved a great deal of success in restoring the oil market to balance and stability. Together, through this equitable and transparent framework for cooperation, we brought hope back to this industry at a time when it had lost its way.

​The most valuable players in this process are in this room. I am, of course, speaking of the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial delegations, which have received excellent backing from the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, the Joint Technical Committee and the OPEC Secretariat.

​These supporting actors have formed the backbone of this process, showing immense determination and a high level of professionalism in providing timely, high-quality market analysis and keen insights in support of our decision-making.

​Thus, as President of the Conference, allow me to again thank each delegation for their valuable contributions and encourage each one to continue in this way moving forward.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Our deliberations of the previous days have focused, to a large extent, on the increasing uncertainty and market volatility of recent months.

​At yesterday’s 176th Meeting of the OPEC Conference, we discussed these issues and how they might evolve over the remainder of 2019, and also considered the future evolution of our cooperation. We will continue with these discussions here today.

​In doing so, let us stay focused on our overarching goal of maintaining the balanced market already achieved and promoting a sustainable stability. This is the only way we will see future growth and enhanced investment in the industry.

​We must not allow our hard-earned progress to be hindered or, even worse, reversed. I assure you that no one in this industry wants to return to the crisis we experienced from 2014 to 2016!

​From Venezuela, we raise our voice in order to avoid using the oil market as a tool to attack the economies of sovereign nations, which directly affects the welfare and development of the people. This is undoubtedly unjust, illegal and immoral, especially if the one who exercises it does so pursuing dominance.

​With this in mind, I want to make it clear that we, the 24 participating nations of the Declaration of Cooperation, will remain vigilant in our efforts to ensure that the global oil market remains balanced and stable.

​We have proven to the world, over the last two years, that together we are stronger than working in silos. And, in the end, this is the only way to overcome our common challenges and achieve our common goals.

​We will thus march forward, arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder, to support a stable oil market, a healthy economy and prosperity for future generations.

​In closing, allow me to share with you some inspirational words from our esteemed former President of Venezuela, HE Hugo Chávez Frías, whose enduring legacy for both my country and indeed for OPEC continues to this day.

​He spoke these words during the 2nd OPEC Summit of Heads of State, which was hosted in Caracas in September of 2000. He said:

​“It was precisely here, in Caracas, where the Statute of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was approved, in January of 1961. I was barely born at that time. OPEC passed the Resolutions of the first Conference in Baghdad, on the shores of the Tigris, on September 14, 1960.”

​He continued with a reflection on the 40 years of cooperation and success of OPEC, commenting:

​“OPEC in these 40 years, the first 40 years, has discharged its objectives and today we are re-launching to continue discharging more effectively our objectives and to update them; to join the new path and write the new history of this new century.”

​And, indeed, Ladies and Gentlemen, next year, we look forward to returning to OPEC’s birthplace in Baghdad to commemorate this Organization’s 60th Anniversary.

​With these impressive milestones behind us and anticipating those yet to come, I truly believe His Excellency Chávez would be proud of what we have achieved together and what we will continue to accomplish in the decades ahead.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/90-2-july-2019.html"
"2019-06-10","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​It was the famous Scottish comedian Billy Connolly who once said: “There are two seasons in Scotland: June and Winter.” I am very happy to be here in June!

​It is truly a tremendous pleasure to be invited to the University of Dundee, and the Centre for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy (CEPMLP), to deliver this keynote address. I would like to thank Vice-Chancellor and Principal Professor, Andrew Atherton, for his welcoming address; Professor Peter Cameron, the Centre’s Director, for the personal invitation; and his staff for making us feel extremely welcome.

​With over 18,000 students from 145 countries and 3,000 staff from 72 countries the University of Dundee is a truly global institution. It also sits in a beautiful city, one promoted as ‘One City, Many Discoveries’ in honour of Dundee's history of scientific activities and of the ship Discovery, Robert Falcon Scott's Antarctic exploration vessel, which was built here in Dundee.

​It highlights the city’s outward looking nature, as well as the warmth it offers to visitors. This is also evidently on display here at the University with its links with other international seats of learning, businesses and governments underscoring the value it places on dialogue and cooperation, which will be one of the two key themes of my paper today.

​In fact, the OPEC Secretariat and our Organization as a whole, has had a strong bond and relationship with the Centre and the University going back several decades.

​Back in 2001, the then OPEC Secretary General, HE Dr Alí Rodríguez Araque delivered the opening address to the Dundee International Oil & Gas Conference. And in 2009, at the 4th OPEC International Seminar, the OPEC Award for Research was given to Paul Stevens, professor emeritus at the Centre; and the OPEC Special Award was given posthumously to Professor Thomas Wälde, who had been instrumental in developing a positive and collaborative relationship with OPEC Member Countries and the OPEC Secretariat.

​I have also been told that the Centre alone has more than 1,000 alumni from my home country of Nigeria; men and women that have passed through these doors to learn about hydrocarbons law, economics and policy. I hope that many more will follow in their footsteps and return to Nigeria, and indeed all our Member Countries, with what they have learnt to help the country develop and deliver a sustainable energy future.

​This will be vital as we head into what is now commonly termed the ‘energy transition’; to determine what this means to each and every one of us, how it affects us, and what is the best and most realistic path. This is the second key theme of my paper today.

​I would also like to pay my respects to another alumni from this Centre, my twin brother and friend, and the moderator of this session, HE Dr Sun Xiansheng, the Secretary General of the International Energy Forum. His boundless dynamism and positivity have elevated the IEF to new levels of accomplishment, admiration and acclaim in driving forward dialogue between all energy industry stakeholders. It is a pleasure to share a stage with you again.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The values that I have just outlined for the University of Dundee and the IEF, related to international cooperation and dialogue, are ‘front and centre’ of everything OPEC stands for and the actions we take.

​They will also be key for the ‘energy transition’, bringing both producers and consumers together, in fact, all energy industry stakeholders, to try and evolve this transition in the least disruptive manner.

​Given the great importance of energy to our everyday lives it is something we have to get right. We need to think carefully about what an energy transition actually means; and we all need to follow the right path to lead us to a sustainable energy future.

​We need to all work together, step-by-step, find issues of commonality and appreciate what is at stake.

​One thing we can all agree on is the world will need a great deal more energy in the decades to come. It is easy to appreciate why.

​The total size of the global economy in 2040 is expected to be 214% that of 2017. And over the same timeframe, world population is projected to reach around 9.2 billion, an increase of over 1.5 billion from today’s level.

​We should also not forget that energy poverty remains a scourge of our time: even though, in a sign of great progress, the International Energy Agency recently reported that the total number of people with access to electricity fell below one billion in 2017, there is much work still to be done. Moreover, three billion people still lack access to clean fuels for cooking.

​We need to transition to a more inclusive world in which every person has access to energy – whether young or old, whether poor or rich. We want to see a world where no one is left behind.

​In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2018, we expect global energy demand to increase by around 33% by 2040. Energy will be required to power more homes, more services, more businesses, more cars, more planes, more ships … I could go on.

​I should also reference that almost 95% of the increase in energy demand is forecast to come from developing countries, with China and India continuing to lead the way.

​At the same time, however, we need to comprehend the threat posed by climate change to our environment.

​Let me stress that OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, which remains the only viable global framework to address climate change.

​As I mentioned at COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, last December, the oil industry must be part of the solution to the climate change challenge. We are all responsible citizens of this planet. We also believe that ‘there is no Planet B.’

​So while the world will need more energy and many billions still need to be lifted out of energy poverty, it also needs to use energy more efficiently and continually look to develop, evolve and adopt cleaner energy technologies.

​This major challenge is what the World Energy Council has called the ‘Energy Trilemma’, which involves balancing these three seemingly conflicting yet interwoven objectives.

​To put it simply, the basic challenge of the ‘energy transition’ can be summed up in two questions.

​The first is how can we ensure there is enough supply to meet expected future demand growth?

​And the second is how can this growth be achieved in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment?

​I feel it is important to point out that when we talk of an energy transition, the word ‘transition’ can be misleading. The dictionary definition of ‘transition’ focuses on the process of changing from one thing to another, but the energy transition does not necessarily mean moving from one energy source to another.

​The majority and balanced consensus is that all forms of energy are required. A diverse mix of sources is the best way forward. It is also vital we appreciate just what each energy source can provide in the decades ahead.

​Renewables are coming of age, with wind and solar expanding fast, but even by 2040 in our WOO they are only estimated to make up around 19% of the global energy mix.

​With nuclear expected to be at just over 6% and coal at around 22% by 2040, it means that oil and gas combined are forecast to still supply over 50% of the world’s energy needs by 2040, with oil at around 28% and gas at 25%.

​Some may dispute these percentage shares, suggest that OPEC Member Countries are against renewables, and of course, you may say to me, well you would say this – you are the OPEC Secretary General.

​Let me counter these arguments.

​Firstly, many OPEC Member Countries have great sources of solar and wind, and we are seeing huge investments being made in the field of renewables. And secondly, we do not see any reputable outlook projecting that renewables will come anywhere close to overtaking oil and gas in the decades ahead.

​Given our Outlook, as well as many others carrying similar forecasts, it is also important to broach the issues of policies and technologies.

​We need to continually look to develop, evolve and adopt cleaner energy technologies, as well as all-inclusive and non-discriminatory energy policies, that enable us to meet expected future energy demand, in a sustainable and ever more efficient manner.

​For oil and gas, we need to recognize that the environmental challenge is not oil and gas themselves. It is the emissions that come from burning them.

​We are believers that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions.

​We should not limit ourselves by putting all our eggs in one basket. We need to look for technology solutions everywhere, across all available energies.

​The oil industry’s capacity for technological innovation must be harnessed within this process.

​We welcome coordinated action within the industry and through various research and development platforms, such as the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative.

​Allow me here to highlight one key detail from our WOO. In the period to 2040, fuel efficiency improvements are expected to result in a far greater reduction in oil demand, than the increasing penetration of alternative fuel vehicles.

​On the policy front, it is important to stress that if our industry is concerned about policies that detrimentally impact investments, with talk of stranded assets and declining values; then we have a potentially dangerous scenario where the necessary investments may not be made, one that could increase volatility significantly and lead to a future energy shortfall.

​Moreover, if those billions of people in the developing world that suffer from a lack of energy access feel they are being sidelined from energies that have helped fuel the developed world, then this could sow further divisions and expand the divide between the haves and have nots.

​This is all brought home by the scale of the oil-related investment requirements that are estimated at around $11 trillion in the period to 2040.

​We also need to recall that exploration and production spending fell by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016, and only increased by 8% in both 2017 and 2018.

​The issue of investments is critical in any talk of an energy transition and diversification. For all investments, the focus has to be on a stable environment and a level playing field.

​From OPEC’s perspective, we fully identify with the fact that the foundation for investment, growth and economic diversification can only come through balance and stability in the market.

​In this regard, OPEC Member Countries remain fully committed to investments across the whole industry value chain, and the issue of returning global investments is a core focus of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​It is also important for me to underscore here that the commitment of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners in the ‘Declaration’ to a balanced market and a sustainable stability remains our key objective.

​We are responsive and alert to shifting market dynamics, and adaptable to ensure that we remain on track.

​We realize that that many underlying risks remain. We are closely monitoring oil market developments and the economic bearishness that has been prevalent in markets in recent weeks, with major challenges and uncertainties related to ongoing trade negotiations, monetary policy developments, as well as geopolitical issues.

​This will all be discussed in detail at the upcoming OPEC Ministerial Conference and the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial meeting, where our minds will be focused on market balance and stability, in the interests of producers, consumers, and the world at large.

​This historic commitment to cooperate and make a difference, for the benefit of all, underscores how OPEC sees the future.

​We can no longer work in silos; we can no longer operate on divergent paths; we can no longer see our futures in polarized terms.

​As the great Scottish born inventor Alexander Graham Bell, a man who invented the first practical telephone that enabled us to all communicate more; once said:

​“Great discoveries and improvements invariably involve the cooperation of many minds.”

​As an industry we need to highlight the great benefits that oil has brought to billions, and the future positive impact it can have on billions of others.

​We need to stress that the scale of the climate challenge means that no single energy source is a panacea; nor can the contribution of an entire industry or group of countries be overlooked.

​We also need to continue to attract young people to the industry, and emphasize that it is a dynamic, creative and expanding global sector, and that the challenges and the innovation required gives plenty of scope to push the boundaries of where technology, such as Artificial Intelligence, can take us. This further underscores the importance of seats of learning like the one here in Dundee.

​And we need to look to work with all stakeholders, including those with divergent opinions, to ensure sustainable growth, development and prosperity for ourselves, for our children and for our children’s children.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/91-10-june-2019.html"
"2019-06-05","​Thank you Helima for the introduction … it is an honour to be able to address such a distinguished conference and such a knowledgeable audience.

​Over the past 30 months or so OPEC, along with its non-OPEC partners in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, have continually demonstrated our utmost commitment to do whatever it takes to balance and stabilize the oil market, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​We have delivered on this promise, with the effectiveness of our joint efforts well-proven since the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ began in January 2017.

​We have been agile and flexible with the partners adapting course depending on market conditions. When the market appeared skewed to oversupply, voluntary production adjustments were adopted and implemented, as was the case in December 2016 and December 2018, and equally, when concerns regarding demand outpacing supply surfaced as the market tightened, as was the case in June 2018, partners in the ‘Declaration’ took appropriate action.

​The ‘Declaration’ has had a transformational impact on the global oil industry and has received the backing of other producers, as well as consumers.

​This commitment to a balanced market and a sustainable stability remains our key objective. And an agile and flexible approach will also be central to how we proceed in the months ahead.

​We will not be swayed by exogenous factors; we have our eyes fixed firmly on our objectives. As we stated at the recent Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) in Jeddah we remain unyielding in looking to further bring down inventory levels, help return investment to the industry, and maintain a healthy supply and demand balance, without under or over-shooting.

​When the next OPEC Ministerial Conference, and the OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, convene in the coming weeks, which I can assure you we will, it will once again underscore that all countries remain resolute in continuing to deliver on this commitment for the remainder of 2019 and beyond.

​We also recognize the fact that underlying risks remain. We are closely monitoring oil market developments, which have seen a high level of volatility in recent weeks, with major challenges and uncertainties related to ongoing trade negotiations, monetary policy developments, as well as geopolitical issues.

​The economic bearishness has led to many institutions revising down their expectations for the global economy and consequently oil demand growth. As you all know, there has also been a significant change in market sentiment, in both equity and financial markets, as attention is increasingly being focused on the Federal Reserve and the trade negotiations.

​This will all play into our calculations in the upcoming ministerial meetings. We always take a very measured approach through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ – we look at the market outlook, we listen to consumers and other stakeholders, and I assure you that we are focused on the interests of the global economy. OPEC has a vested interest in the continued growth and stability of the US and by extension the global economy.

​We are also fully transparent about what we do. We are an open book. A fish bowl. We are continually looking to break down barriers. In this regard, all our publications and data are available online, accessible via digital Apps to the general public free of charge.

​OPEC recognizes that the challenge of balancing the oil market and maintaining stability is a continuous process, and a shared responsibility.

​The ‘Declaration’ is not about short-termism. We are focused on continuity; we have short-term objectives, as well as long-term goals.

​Allow me to conclude by announcing that next year is the 60th Anniversary of the establishment of OPEC. It is a remarkable achievement. We have evolved over this time to adapt to an ever-changing industry, and to major shifts in markets, as well as the global energy landscape.

​We will no doubt continue to evolve, but our core objective will not; the determination and resolve to maintain a balanced oil market and achieve a sustainable stability, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​To sum up: our achievements to date through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ have shown what can be achieved in helping return balance and stability to the market, and you can be confident that we will continue to be unbending in this objective at the upcoming Ministerial meetings and beyond.

​May the spirit of Eid El Fitr infuse your deliberations.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/92-5-june-2019.html"
"2019-05-19","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​It is a great pleasure to see the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) return to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the beautiful and historic city of Jeddah, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

​I would like to thank our generous and gracious hosts, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and in particular, HE Khalid Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Chairman of the JMMC, for the outstanding arrangements made for our meetings, that are taking place during the holy month of Ramadan.

​The friendly welcome we have received and the tireless efforts of the team here in Saudi Arabia should be roundly praised and applauded. Allow me to give a special salute to HRH Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman .

​I should also like to acknowledge the pivotal leadership role that Saudi Arabia has played in the implementation of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ since its inception in January 2017. It has lead the way with its voluntary production adjustments, often going above and beyond its commitments.

​Alongside HE Al-Falih as Chairman of the JMMC is HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. Their continued stewardship of the JMMC in 2019 is vital to all of us, with their tireless dedication and leadership an encouragement to all of us to continue to strive for the market balance and the sustainable oil market stability that both producers and consumers desire.

​It is also a great pleasure to be serving on this committee with many other dedicated and hard-working ministers. I am sure it is a committee that will continue to be collaborative, resilient and adaptable. I also would like to welcome HE Mohamed Arkab, Minister of Energy of Algeria.

​In my role as OPEC Conference President in 2019 I am regularly briefed and kept informed of developments and shifts in the global oil market landscape, by HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General, and his diligent team at the OPEC Secretariat.

​In fact, I am sure we all greatly appreciate the continued excellent support, research and analysis that assists all nations in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​From the standpoint of my home country Venezuela, it is evidently a very challenging time given that we are under siege from illegitimate sanctions, face intimidation and threats, both internally and externally, and our people continue to suffer from the economic warfare being raged against us.

​Let me stress that we remain resolute in standing up to these unlawful actions, and are steadfast in our determination to overcome these acts of aggression.

​I hope we can continue to count on the international community, and the support of OPEC, as well as non-OPEC producers in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, to resolve these challenges through open and fair dialogue.

​It is also important to stress the potential impact of these sanctions on the global oil market, through the introduction of more volatility and uncertainty, when what we all require is a balanced and stable market to help bring more solidity and growth to the oil sector.

​From the perspective of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, overall conformity levels to the new voluntary production adjustments have continued to improve month-on-month. It is vital that all participating countries remain steadfast in their focus on the full and timely implementation of the decisions taken in December 2018.

​There is clear evidence that we have seen an improvement in market conditions over the first four months of 2019, compared to the turbulence and volatility of the fourth quarter of 2019.

​However, it remains vital that we continue to take a measured approach. We will continue to monitor the global and regional economic outlook and the oil market fundamentals, given the ongoing increases in non-OPEC supply and the expected drop off in oil demand this year, compared to 2018.

​In this regard, it is also vital to observe the underlying risks, such as ongoing trade negotiations, monetary policy developments and complex geopolitical challenges.

​Today, the JMMC will review the prepared reports and analysis from the Joint Technical Committee and the OPEC Secretariat, make recommendations where relevant and applicable, which will then feed into the 176th Meeting of the OPEC Conference and 6th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting at the end of June.

​As OPEC Conference President, I feel it is also important to stress that the ‘Declaration’ is not about short-termism. We are focused on continuity.

​There remains a common sense of purpose that OPEC’s cooperation with our non-OPEC partners, fuelled by the positive spirit of equity, fairness and transparency, continues in one form or another in the years ahead.

​Over the past two years or so we have achieved great things, and I have no doubt that we can continue to achieve great things in the future.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/93-19-may-2019.html"
"2019-05-19","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​Ramadan Kareem. Allow me to stand on existing protocols.

​For centuries, the good people of Jeddah and Arabia have opened their homes and their hearts to visitors from across the globe, and in doing so, this city has earned its reputation as one of the most hospitable and welcoming places on earth. I am in the fortunate position of being able to personally attest to this generosity and graciousness, as I made my first trip to Saudi Arabia in 1977 (42 years ago), along with my parents to my first Haj, and have eagerly returned at least once almost every year, since then.

​The excellent arrangements for our meetings are even more remarkable given the fact that we are meeting during the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims from across the world descend on Mecca and Medina to perform blessed Umrah. Of course, this presented a logistical challenge for our hosts, in catering for each and every one of us.

​On behalf of the OPEC Secretariat, I would like to extend our sincere thanks and deep appreciation to HE Khalid Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Chairman of the JMMC, for the outstanding provision made for our meetings this week. I’d also like to thank his very able team for their tireless work, in particular Eng. Adeeb Al-Aama, Dr. Nasser A. Al-Dossary, Sami Mehaid, Mohammed Al-Thomairi, Mohammad Al-Khaldi, Tariq Nasser, Dr. Samiha Al Khayat, Eissa Elzerma, Fahad Toryf, Abbad Fantani, Abdullah Al Issa, Khaled Al Attiby, Jamil Dandany, Huda Alshwaier, Amal Alsayegh, Eiman Saad and all other representatives from Saudi Arabia who have made these meetings possible.

​Returning to our own work, I would also like to pay tribute to Saudi Arabia for its outstanding leadership role in our collective endeavours. From the inception of our voluntary production adjustments under the DoC in January 2017, the Kingdom has led by example, demonstrating selflessness, responsibility and willingness to prioritize the common good. We deeply appreciate that this has not been easy and has required your country to make difficult decisions and painful sacrifices. Simply put, the exceptional rate of success that we have enjoyed to date, would not have been possible without this exemplary leadership on your part.

​The Hadith tells us that the Messenger of Allah said of the month of Ramadan:

​“It is the month of patience, and the reward of patience is Heaven. It is the month of charity, and a month in which a believer’s sustenance is increased.” [Narrated by Ibn Khuzaymah]

​During Ramadan, all of us have the opportunity to recommit ourselves to the bonds of friendship, community and collegiality that unite us. We are called to demonstrate a spirit of cooperation, collaboration and fraternal respect among all nations. May the spirit of this holy month enthuse our meeting today and all our meetings going forward.

​Adherence to the spirit of Ramadan necessitates that in our deliberations, we must focus on areas of agreement, common interest and seek convergence of opinion. Occasional divergence in viewpoints is, of course, natural, even among friends. Nevertheless, we stand to gain so much more when we remain focused on our multitude of mutual interests and shared objectives.

​Excellencies,

​Throughout our Organization’s history, we have overcome obstacles which appeared insurmountable at the time. Some of these challenges in the past were much more daunting than any uncertainties in our current times. Yet we persevered. And in doing so, we excelled and attained even greater heights than anyone could have imagined.

​The reasons our Organization and partnership continues to thrive are multifarious and too numerous to list in their entirety now. But throughout our history, just as the Bedouins navigate their journey guided by the stars in the heavens, we have been guided by the constellation of the core principles of transparency, fairness and equity. These principles have been critical to our successes and have ensured our cohesiveness. If we continue to place our trust in these principles, our group interests will triumph.

​Another critical factor in our success is the fact that OPEC has benefitted from the contribution of outstanding and dedicated public servants and leaders from our Member Countries. And I can think of no better exemplification of the type of intelligence, wisdom and selfless commitment to duty that has immeasurably enriched our Organization than the chairman of this Committee, HE Khalid Al-Falih.

​How fortunate for all of us that his partner from the Russian Federation, HE Alexander Novak, would demonstrate a similar array of extraordinary talents. The positive symbiosis between OPEC and non-OPEC is an enormous credit to these two gentlemen, who exemplify the umbilical cord that brings us together.

​Allow me to conclude by once again thanking our Saudi Arabian hosts and wishing us all fruitful discussions.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/94-19-may-2019.html"

"2019-04-29","​Ladies and gentlemen,

​On behalf of Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General, I would like to pass on his sincere apologies for not being able to attend this event in person.

​He is deeply honoured and humbled to receive this prestigious Award and would like to thank Euroknowledge and everyone involved for bestowing such a respected accolade.

​In his role as OPEC Secretary General he also interprets this Award as recognition of a number of factors, all focused on the key words: ‘cooperation, cooperation, cooperation’.

​Firstly, the teamwork, dedication and selflessness of a remarkable group of countries: namely, the strategic partners in the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ that are focused on balancing the market and helping achieve a sustainable oil market stability.

​He believes that working with statesmen, leaders and representatives of OPEC Member Countries and non-OPEC producing countries has been the honour of a lifetime. Moreover, the tireless work has borne fruit and the oil industry is in a much healthier place than it was when the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ was initiated in January 2017.

​Secondly, this development, as well as the rejuvenation of OPEC, has also occurred at the same time as the intensification of OPEC’s engagement with Africa. Today, half of OPEC’s Membership comes from this great continent.

​And thirdly, due to the unflagging efforts and the diligent and expert work of the team he leads at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna. They are the backbone of the Organization.

​Looking to the future, OPEC will never cease to advocate for cooperation, collaboration and fraternity among nations as the best solutions to overcoming challenges, and with this in mind, I would like to leave you with one of Mr Barkindo’s favourite African proverbs:

​“If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”

​Thank you and I wish everyone a successful event.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/96-29-april-2019.html"
"2019-04-03","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​It gives me great pleasure to return home to mother Africa and to participate at such an important oil industry event, the APPO CAPE VII Congress and Exhibition, and one that is taking place in an OPEC Member Country, Equatorial Guinea.

​Since it became an OPEC Member in May 2017, Equatorial Guinea has played an ever more proactive and expansive role in helping deliver the Organization’s mission and objectives. This has been particularly evident through the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between OPEC nations and 10 non-OPEC producers, which was put together to stimulate and accelerate the drawdown of the stock overhang, expedite the rebalancing of the oil market, restore a sustainable stability to the oil industry and enable investments to return.

​The success and the future evolution of the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ is something I will return to later in my remarks.

​The year 2019 is what Equatorial Guinea has labelled its ‘Year of Energy’ campaign, with the country promoting intra-African cooperation and pan-African alliance building, championing its oil and gas projects and hosting other flagship energy events, such as the forthcoming 5th Gas Exporting Countries Forum Summit in November this year.

​The ‘Year of Energy’ actually sits between two landmark milestones, the 50th anniversary of Equatorial Guinea’s Independence Day on 12 October, 2018, and the 60th Anniversary of OPEC and the historic Baghdad Conference that will take place from September 10–14, 2020: two significant events for developing nations asserting their sovereign and legitimate independence over their natural resources.

​In terms of the ‘Year of Energy’ campaign I can already sense the benefits and possibilities at this Congress. The commitment of Equatorial Guinea, and the courage of its able leaders is clear for all to see.

​All this has been made possible by a statesman who has shown great fortitude, bravery and vision over the past 38 years in leading his country, His Excellency Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of Equatorial Guinea. He is a symbol of peace, stability and prosperity on the African continent.

​On the energy side, the President is ably and skillfully supported by HE Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, the country’s Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons and his very able team.

​In preparing for this event, I was actually reading an interview that HE Mbaga Obiang Lima conducted with the OPEC Bulletin in December last year. In this, he stated that the ‘Declaration’ had been something extremely positive for Equatorial Guinea, the best thing for oil producers, and important for consumers too.

​These are wise words.

​In less than two years, Equatorial Guinea has become a key advocate for OPEC and an important influencer for the Organization. It has found a welcome home in the OPEC family.

​It is clear that the country’s leadership recognizes the value in working through organizations like OPEC, which can empower African countries with a voice on the international stage.

​Under the exemplary and visionary leadership of President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, and the stewardship of HE Obiang Lima, the country’s oil and gas sector is continuing to evolve and expand, and help further energize its economy.

​This includes attracting new investment, plans to launch new licensing rounds for both oil and natural gas, with many overseas operators interested in new blocks, as well as continuing work on improving the regulatory environment.

​The advancement in Equatorial Guinea’s business environment was recently commended by the African Energy Chamber, which highlighted the country’s establishment of an all-inclusive model for setting up businesses in the country. It said that the new one-stop shop allows companies to set up a business in the country in only one week, putting the country at par with global standards.

​These developments should all be lauded. Equatorial Guinea is becoming a beacon of light for oil industry investment – the vital cog in our industry’s future – one of the key doorways to the Gulf of Guinea, and a driving force for cooperation across the region.

​I have no doubt the future is bright for the country, not only due to its oil and gas sector, but also given some of its other resources, such as its rich expanses of water and deepwater ports, as well as its efforts to diversify the economy by encouraging agriculture and financial services.

​I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the organizers of this event, the African Petroleum Producers Organization, its President HE Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu from Nigeria, and its Secretary General, HE Mahaman Laouan Gaya. Not only for putting on such a great conference, but also for the continued backing of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​HE Gaya has been a regular attendee at OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings in Vienna, offering encouragement and support for the ‘Declaration’ and its objectives. I also know that he is a keen advocate of African regional cooperation and the advancement of synergies in all sectors of the continent’s economies in order to boost growth.

​This is clearly evident here in Equatorial Guinea, and at this APPO Congress and Exhibition.

​It is much easier to collaborate when we are united; when we find common cause and goals. As the famous English poet John Donne once said:

​“No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent.”

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​This line leads me elegantly back to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ itself and how this reinforced the mantra that ‘together we can do so much’.

​Allow me turn your minds back to the period 2014-2016; it is not a time that conjures up happy thoughts for the industry. The severe three-year downturn brought the industry to its knees.

​Throughout 2016 there was a recognition that it would take a monumental effort to turn this situation around. However, this herculean task was one that needed to be undertaken.

​Through numerous and extensive bilateral and multilateral consultations with many OPEC Ministers, non-OPEC Ministers, as well as some Heads of State and Governments, 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations, eventually to draft and agree on the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ in December 2016.

​It was a first in many ways:

​It brought together 24 sovereign producing nations, which is unparalleled in the history of the oil industry.

​It also focused on a key industry metric, the five-year average for OECD commercial oil stocks, which was both definable and measurable.

​And from the beginning, it was a transparent and fully accessible platform, through its key functioning bodies, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), all supported by the OPEC Secretariat.

​Of course, it took some time to reverse the pathway the industry had been on, but there is no doubt that the ‘Declaration’ has had a transformational impact on the global oil industry and has received the backing of other producers, as well as consumers. It has broken long standing barriers and turned a new glorious page in the history of oil.

​The change we have seen over the past two years or so is like night and day.

​It took us around 18 months to assist the oil market in returning OECD inventory levels to the five-year average, which helped return balance to the market and reintroduced a long-absent element of stability. There is now far more optimism and confidence in our industry.

​Moreover, when we saw conformity levels to the voluntary production adjustments overshoot in the middle of 2018, we were agile and flexible enough to modify course and stay ahead of the curve. When the market has appeared skewed to oversupply, we reacted accordingly, and equally, when concerns were expressed regarding demand outpacing supply, the partners in the ‘Declaration’ took the appropriate action.

​It has had a positive impact on the global economy, and trade worldwide responded positively, helped by the stimulus provided through the ‘Declaration’.

​The financial markets, in general, and the financial oil market, in particular, have welcomed the forward guidance provided by the ‘Declaration’. It has given them a sense of understanding and security, and to avoid any crisis like that seen in 2008.

​It has also caused a significant change in industry-wide and public perceptions of OPEC. The Organization has ably demonstrated its credentials as a body committed to international cooperation, working with other producers, honouring its commitments and promoting mutual respect among all nations.

​Let me stress that we also recognize our mission is never accomplished; the challenge of balancing the market and maintaining stability is a continuous process.

​This was in evidence at the most recent meeting of the JMMC in Baku, Azerbaijan, on March 18.

​The Committee recognized the current, critical uncertainties surrounding the global oil market throughout 2019, and stressed on the shared responsibility of all participating countries in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ to sustain market stability and prevent the recurrence of any market imbalance.

​Every country understands the importance of achieving full and timely conformity with their voluntary production adjustments under the decisions of the 175th Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the 5th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, on the 6 and 7 December 2018.

​Overall conformity levels to the new voluntary production adjustments, reached almost 90% for the month of February 2019, which is up from 83% in the month of January. We expect them to improve further in the coming months.

​While we have seen a marked improvement in market conditions in the 1Q19, compared to the turbulence and volatility of the 4Q18, with the market steadily moving towards a more balanced state, we still believe we need to see inventory levels drop further.

​We also recognize the fact that underlying risks remain, such as ongoing trade negotiations, monetary policy developments, as well as increasingly complex geopolitical challenges and climate change-related concerns.

​Additionally, we need to see a further pick-up in industry investments, particularly for long cycle projects. We need to remind ourselves that exploration and production spending fell by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016, and only increased by 8% in both 2017 and 2018.

​It is why we continue to take a very measured approach through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ – we look at the economic and market outlook, and we listen to consumers and other stakeholders.

​The ‘Declaration’ is not about short-termism. We are focused on continuity; we are steadfast and completely unwavering; we have long-term objectives and goals.

​This was exemplified in Baku through further statements of support by participating countries for a permanent intergovernmental platform, under the Charter of Cooperation between Oil Producing Countries.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​When looking at the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ it gives me great pleasure to say that over one-third of the 24 participants are from Africa: Algeria; Angola; the Republic of the Congo; Equatorial Guinea; Gabon; Libya; Nigeria; Sudan; and South Sudan.

​Moreover, half of OPEC’s Membership comes from this continent of Africa.

​This underscores the vital role this great continent plays within OPEC, within the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, and within the global oil industry.

​As we all know, it is also a great continent with enormous resources; ever-expanding financial, industrial and business sectors; a growing and dynamic population; and a place that still has huge untapped potential.

​In terms of oil, Africa has around 130 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, an increase of around 50% since the end of last century. And in terms of proven natural gas reserves, the figure is over 15 trillion standard cubic metres, a number that has more than doubled since the mid-1980s.

​It is irrefutable evidence of the petroleum potential of Africa, the exciting and abundant opportunities, and the role that this industry can play in unleashing tremendous economic development and prosperity across the continent.

​Additionally, according to the United Nations, more than half of global population growth between now and 2050 is expected to occur in Africa. It underscores the fact that the continent will continue to have a young and vibrant population; a wealth of human capital needed to develop the available resources, and ensure that the continent takes its leading position on the global stage.

​We need to harness what we have – in terms of resources and our people – to ensure that everyone benefits, and that no one is left behind.

​Moreover, it also requires collaboration, the promotion of intra-African cooperation and pan-African alliance building, which is evidently apparent here today.

​All this can only be achieved under great leadership, such as that exhibited here in Equatorial Guinea. To prosper we need peace, far-sightedness and stability.

​Allow me to conclude with an African proverb:

​“Keep your head and heart going in the right direction and you will not have to worry about your feet.”

​At times the challenges before us can appear daunting, but experience has repeatedly shown us that visionary leadership, teamwork, the enduring principle of cooperation and the bravery to try something new, can bring about great success.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/98-3-april-2019.html"
"2019-04-02","​Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is a tremendous honour to be asked to address such a distinguished gathering this evening.

​The APPO CAPE Congress and Exhibition has become an integral event for Africa, in terms of bringing people, companies and governments together, underscoring the importance of an African vision and unity, and in helping harness the incredible potential of this great continent.

​This evening, and the following three days, has been made possible by a great number of people all of whom deserve profuse thanks, but I would like to take this opportunity to recognize a distinguished few.

​His Excellency Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of Equatorial Guinea, who has ably and with great courage led his country for the past 38 years. Under his capable and visionary leadership, Equatorial Guinea has been transformed into a stable, peaceful and prosperous nation.

​I had the distinct honour of an audience with His Excellency in July 2017, shortly after his country joined OPEC. I was extremely grateful for his wise insights, his welcome views on the positive face of OPEC in attracting new members and his full support for OPEC and its objectives.

​HE Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Equatorial Guinea’s Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons.

​My friend, brother and compatriot has proven to be an important addition to the OPEC Ministerial Conference and the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, since his country became part of the ‘Declaration’ in December 2016 and an OPEC Member in May 2017.

​His passion and enthusiasm for OPEC, his home country and Africa are clear for all to see.

​He has been a driving force behind the modernization of Equatorial Guinea’s resources; he has been a great advocate of enhancing cooperation in the region; and at OPEC he continues to impress us with his astute insights and judicious views; long may this continue!

​And HE Mahaman Laouan Gaya, the Secretary General of the African Petroleum Producers Organization. Over the past two years or so he has shown great support for the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​His organization is also a great champion and initiator of bringing together African petroleum producing countries to cooperate, collaborate, and share knowledge and competencies. The APPO Congress and Exhibition is a clear testament to this vision.

​Standing here as OPEC Secretary General I would also like to underscore the intertwined history of OPEC and APPO.

​The idea of creating an African Petroleum Producers Organization dates back to the 1980’s during informal meetings between Africa’s OPEC Members, then Algeria, Gabon, Libya and Nigeria.

​These talks were then taken further in 1986 on the sidelines of an OPEC Ministerial Meeting on Brioni Island, in the former Yugoslavia, now in Croatia, and then at a meeting in Algiers in the early part of 1986.

​The Algiers meeting was decisive in leading to eight African Countries – Algeria, Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, Libya and Nigeria – holding a meeting in Lagos, Nigeria, to create the African Petroleum Producers Association in January 1987.

​In terms of goals and objectives there are evidently similarities to OPEC.

​In fact, the idea for the Organization that I humbly represent today was conceived in Africa, specifically Egypt. It was at the Maadi Yacht Club in Cairo, in April 1959 – 60 years ago this month – where the Gentleman’s Agreement was forged that paved the way for the establishment of OPEC.

​The unstoppable momentum generated in Cairo would eventually culminate in the setting up of the Organization in Baghdad in September 1960 by the five Founding Members – Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela – around the premise of cooperation.

​What is also evident is that today are a number of countries that are common to OPEC, APPO and the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ – Algeria; Angola; the Republic of the Congo; Equatorial Guinea; Gabon; Libya; Nigeria and Sudan – and over the past few years we have seen an intensification of OPEC’s engagement with Africa.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​What the formation of OPEC and APPO underscore, and what is clearly evident here in Equatorial Guinea through the country’s esteemed leadership, is the value placed on collaboration.

​It can often appear that our industry is subject to forces beyond our control. Geopolitical events, natural catastrophes, technological breakthroughs or other critical uncertainties: we are all aware of the impact they can have.

​However, as Equatorial Guinea, APPO, OPEC and the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ shows, there is another force alive and well in our industry.

​This is the desire of producers, consumers and investors to have sustainable stability in the oil market. This force thrives in the hearts and minds of decision makers who know that collaboration and teamwork remain the most effective problem-solving techniques this industry or indeed any industry knows.

​This force underpins the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ and encourages other stakeholders, many of whom are in this room, to lend their support to this noble cause.

​This force can lead us out of any darkness and into the light. It is based on the principles of transparency, fairness, equity and respect among nations.

​Allow me to leave with you one of my favourite African proverbs:

​“If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”

​Cooperation, cooperation, cooperation: I have no doubt that this force will lead our industry into a glorious future, with the interests of consumers and producers, firmly at its heart.

​Thank you. And enjoy the evening.​

"2019-03-18","​Your Excellencies,

​Distinguished colleagues,

​Good morning.

​It is a great honor for me to represent the State of Kuwait at the 13th meeting of the JMMC being held in the lovely city of Baku.

​I would like to start by adding my voice in thanking the Republic of Azerbaijan for its generosity and great hospitality extended to us during our stay.

​It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of capable ministers for the first time.

​The JMMC and JTC supported by the OPEC Secretariat have been instrumental over the past two years in delivering detailed and very accurate analysis of oil markets conditions.

​Such analysis has enabled this distinguished group to make appropriate recommendations for ensuring the continuous successful implementation of the “Declaration of Cooperation.”

​As your Excellencies surely recall, the State of Kuwait chaired the JMMC and JTC in the beginning of this journey back in 2017, and we are very proud to have been a part of this success story.

​I assure you that the State of Kuwait remains steadfast in its support of the “Declaration of Cooperation”, through its continued pro-active role and membership in this distinguished body.

​Furthermore, Kuwait is fully committed in implementing its share of the production adjustments agreed between the 24 countries on December 7, 2018, as it has demonstrated over the past two years.

​I look forward to continuing to play a constructive and leading role under the able leadership of my distinguished colleagues the Co-Chairs, and fellow distinguished members of the JMMC.

​Thank you and I wish everybody a successful and productive meeting.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/99-18-march-2019.html"
"2019-03-18","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​It is a great pleasure to be here in the beautiful city of Baku, the cradle of the oil industry that has helped fuel the current civilizations.

​On behalf of the Organization, I would like to thank HE Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan and HE Parviz Shahbazov, Minister of Industry and Energy, for generously hosting the 13th Meeting of Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC). We greatly appreciate the excellent arrangements, the warm welcome and the wonderful hospitality.

​Azerbaijan has been consistent in its constructive role in evolving relations between OPEC and non-OPEC, especially in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​I should also like to add here that is a great honour for Venezuela, and for me personally, to preside over the OPEC Conference in 2019.

​It is currently a challenging time for my country, with Venezuela under siege from illegitimate sanctions, and an economic warfare against its people. I hope we can count on the international community, and the support of OPEC Members and non-OPEC, to resolve these challenges through open and fair dialogue, which in turn will help return stability, and bring more solidity and growth to our oil sector.

​As Conference President, I look forward to carrying on the excellent and diligent work of my recent predecessors, HE Khalid A. Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, Industry & Mineral Resources and HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister of Energy & Industry, who were respectively, OPEC Conference President’s in 2017 and 2018. They both raised the bar with their outstanding performances, and we intend to continue to work with you, benefitting from your rich experiences.

​We are extremely pleased to see that HE Al-Falih and HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation have resumed their stewardship of the JMMC in 2019. Let me stress that we all value their resourceful leadership and extensive experience that continues to inform and drive this Committee’s valuable work.

​I would also like to say it has been an honour for Venezuela to serve on the JMMC for the last two years.

​We have to continue with the transparent and inclusive manner that has driven the JMMC, under the able direction of our two Chairs.

​The JMMC has proven to be a collaborative, resilient and adaptable platform that has been able to help address imbalances in the market, and allow us to deliver on the objectives of the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​The OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, and his able Secretariat team should also be greatly appreciated for their continued great support, not only to the Organization, but to all the nations in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​We also need to recognize that we are living in a fast changing world of new energy realities; one where we need to continually evolve, enhance the gravitas of OPEC and this historic cooperation, and further our outreach to all stakeholders.

​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​Looking back over the past two years or so, we should be proud of our joint efforts.

​Since the beginning of the historical cooperation for oil market stability in January 2017, participating countries to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ have consistently honoured their voluntary commitments and achieved remarkable success.

​However, we need to recognize the ever-evolving nature of the market, and be ready to take the necessary actions so as to continue to fully support the objectives of the ‘Declaration’.

​This was evident in the unanimous decisions taken in December 2018 at the 175th Meeting of the Conference and the 5th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting to voluntary adjust production by a combined 1.2 million barrels a day throughout the first half of 2019.

​It is evident that since the beginning of the year overall conformity levels to these new voluntary production adjustments have improved and are expected to further advance in the coming months.

​It is vital that all participating countries remain steadfast in their focus on the full and timely implementation of the decisions taken in December 2018.

​Moreover, we also need to be cognizant of how this vital ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ partnership evolves.

​The basic premise of further strengthening our cooperation with our non-OPEC partners within a Charter of Cooperation between oil producing countries was unanimously “endorsed in principle” by Ministers in December.

​As Conference President in 2019, I am fully focused on this Charter of Cooperation between Oil Producing Countries, fuelled by the positive spirit of equity, fairness and transparency, which will be presented to our Ministerial Conferences in April.

​As we have done since the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ began at the start of 2017, we need to be flexible, adaptable and realistic. There is no doubt that the future can see us achieve great things together, just as we have achieved great things over the past two years or so.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/100-18-march-2019.html"
"2019-03-18","​Distinguished Ministers, Secretary General, dear guests,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

​I would like to welcome all of you in beautiful Baku at the 13th meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee.

​At the outset, let me specifically greet the Chairman of the JMMC, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, His Excellency Mr. Khalid A. Al Falih, the co-chair of the JMMC – Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, His Excellency Mr. Alexander Novak, the incumbent President of the OPEC Conference, the People's Minister of Petroleum of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, His Excellency Manuel Salvador Quevedo Fernandez, and the OPEC Secretary General, His Excellency Mr. Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo.

​I also want to welcome distinguished Ministers and Heads of Delegations of other JMMC members and those from OPEC and non-OPEC countries. I want to thank you all, Excellences, for accepting the invitation of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, His Excellency Mr. Ilham Aliyev to hold an OPEC+ event in Baku and for being with us today.

​As a matter of fact, the creation of the united format of OPEC and non-OPEC countries in order to tackle the challenges in the global oil market stems from the idea by President Ilham Aliyev, which he proposed during World Economic Forum held in Davos in 2016. He said that more coordination between OPEC members and non-OPEC members with respect of the reduction of production can bring results.

​Your presence in Baku for this meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee testifies to high value attached to the history of oil.

​This event also legitimizes the historic role of Azerbaijan in oil industry as the land of first industrially drilled oil well, the origin of the first offshore oil platform and the first oil pipeline, by giving these facts a widespread acceptance. This very country – Azerbaijan, was the world champion in oil production and refining in 1899 and accounted for the half of world oil production volume.

​Azerbaijan does not export big volumes to the world market. However, its modest role is enhanced by the fact that Azerbaijan works towards ensuring energy security in the neighboring regions and the larger continent, and acts as a reliable partner in regard to the large scale energy projects that it implements in cooperation with its partners.

​Ladies and Gentlemen,

​We have come a long way since countries in the OPEC+ format joined their efforts towards achieving market stabilization through production adjustments. We are pleased with our results.

​I hope that our discussions on the draft “Charter of Cooperation among Oil Producing Countries” will also be soon finalized and we will hence continue our efforts towards maintaining market balance within a more consolidated framework.

​Our experience of close collaboration within the Declaration of Cooperation for more than two years as well as the tendencies of the global oil market and geopolitical realities also demonstrate that our cooperation is indispensable for mitigation of risks.

​We can assert with confidence that OPEC+ format is an effective platform influencing global energy market. We have seen the impacts of our decisions. Our unity of purpose ensures taking necessary decisions for achieving the balance between supply and demand in order to stabilize oil prices. OPEC+ provides reliable and in most cases, the only support to the global oil market. Our collaboration within the OPEC+ format define the future prospects of our cooperation and set the patterns of progress in world oil market.

​Currently we are experiencing positive dynamism in the prices for oil. We managed to avert the slump in oil prices observed since October last year. This is our common success and we should work further to maintain our achievements.

​I hope that today’s discussions will enable us to analyze the current situation and make projections for future. Let me express again our satisfaction to host this event in Baku and note that Azerbaijan will henceforth stand ready to continue supporting the efforts towards balancing global oil market.

​Last, but not least, allow me to thank OPEC Secretariat for all the support, high professionalism and dedication demonstrated in the run up to this JMMC meeting and wish success to our today’s deliberations.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/101-18-march-2019.html"

"2019-03-18","Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

Salam!

Permit me to thank the Ministers for their wise and eloquent words, and add a few of my own.

The emerging consensus from the jury is that the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has ushered in a new, successful chapter in the long history of oil. And as we contextualise our work within the history of our industry, I can think of few more fitting locations for a meeting of the JMMC than Baku, a city that has been synonymous with oil for centuries, if not millennia.

Our industry is acutely conscious of the tremendous debt we owe this city, this nation and this region. From as early as the tenth century, medieval writers and explorers recorded their observations about the supply of oil in Azerbaijan. The use of oil from this region is also described with admiration in the works of famous 12th-century poet Nizami Ganjavi and by the 13th-century Venetian explorer, Marco Polo; for the goods and products of Azerbaijani towns and settlements spread along the Great Silk Roads with tremendous success as a trade route.

And it was in Baku, during the great Oil Boom throughout the latter half of the 19th century, that some of the greatest geologists, chemists, entrepreneurs and inventors which our industry has ever known, thrived and fundamentally changed our industry forever. In 1846, more than a decade before ‘Colonel’ Edwin L. Drake struck oil on American soil for the first time, a 21 meter well was drilled in Bibi-Heybat for oil exploration--the first successfully drilled oil well in human history.

In 1876, Konon Lisenko, Chair of Chemistry for the St. Petersburg Mining Institute, visited Baku to study the oil industry. As a result of his findings, he published a monograph in St. Petersburg called ""Oil Production, According to the Latest Data."" This seminal monograph was one of the first original oil-related publications ever written. OPEC’s own publications, for example our WOO and MOMR, continue a noble tradition that began in Baku.

In 1877, in a development which literally revolutionized our industry, the Nobel brothers, Robert and Ludwig, built the first oil tanker ship in Baku, the Zoroaster. Consider how this innovation has determined the nature of the deployment of tankers to fulfil the requirements of major maritime operations over the last 142 years.

These are but a few highlights of the vast array of technological innovations that originate from Baku which shape the oil industry as we know it today; for this is truly a city of firsts: it was also the site of the first wooden oil derrick in 1871 and the first distillery in 1876. Therefore, I know I speak on behalf of all of us as keen students of the history of oil, when I say that it is an absolute joy to convene our meeting in Baku, the cradle of the oil industry.

Allow me to sincerely thank our Azerbaijani hosts, HE President Ilham Aliyev and our dear friend, HE Parviz Shahbazov, Minister of Energy. Given this is the city of oil industry firsts, it is small wonder that Azerbaijan’s President, HE Ilham Aliyev, was the first world leader to publically call upon OPEC and non-OPEC to close ranks and collaborate in order to rescue the oil industry. His visionary leadership honours his country’s incredible history. President Aliyev is a steadfast supporter of the “Declaration of Cooperation” and the partnership between OPEC and Azerbaijan has never been stronger. I’d also like to commend Minister Shahbazov for his tireless dedication to our common endeavours and the outstanding arrangements for our meetings this week. It is very clear to all of us why Azerbaijani hospitality is so world renowned.

I’d also like to pay tribute to another great friend, HE Manuel Salvador Quevedo Fernandez, the People’s Minister of Petroleum of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, who has made a tremendous start to his tenure as President of the OPEC Conference 2019. I am very pleased that you have joined us today which further affirms your commitment to our great noble endeavour.

Finally, it is a factual certainty that future books on the oil industry will have a chapter on the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process. Two of the protagonists of this glorious chapter are the co-chairmen of our JMMC, HE Khalid A. Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. As tomorrow’s historians chronicle this remarkable journey, the wisdom, dedication to public service and international cooperation that these two gentlemen consistently demonstrate will be written in stone. I commend their steadfast leadership, which has ensured that the JMMC, the umbilical cord between OPEC and non-OPEC, is unified, highly motivated and purpose-driven.

The city of Baku has centuries of experience of fostering dialogue and innovation. May the spirit of Baku, the city of firsts, inspire our work today and throughout 2019.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/103-18-march-2019.html"
"2019-03-14","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers of the 30th World Congress of the International Road Transport Union (IRU) for inviting me to deliver this keynote address on the highly topical subject of “Oil and the fuel price — the link to market stability”.

[Slide 2] As representatives of a major consumer and end-user of oil products, I am sure that the IRU is keenly aware of the challenges facing the oil market over the last two years.

[Slide 3] The first has been meeting exceptionally high levels of growth in oil demand from large emerging economies, especially China and India, as well as from some developed economies, such as the USA. High oil demand by itself is good news: it is a reflection of a healthy world economy, better social progress in many parts of the world, and, maybe, some success in poverty eradication, as this inevitably translates into higher energy consumption. Nevertheless, this sudden surge in the demand placed great stress along the entire supply chain of the oil market, especially those areas like the downstream that over the years had been allowed to become bottlenecks.

[Slide 4] This brings the second challenge: ensuring that there is sufficient supply in the market to match or exceed the increase in consumption. The surge in demand that took place over 2004 was adequately met thanks to the existence of OPEC spare capacity. [Slide 5] Since then, OPEC has maintained a high level of output to ensure that market needs are meet, even in times of large weather-related supply disruptions, as were witnessed last year in the USA. [Slide 6] Additionally, OPEC Member Countries have accelerated their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and to ensure a comfortable level of spare capacity.

[Slide 7] The downstream, however, has been less responsive, and it is now widely accepted that much of the price volatility over the past two years has been driven more by downstream constraints in consuming countries than by shortages the upstream.

These challenges have only been compounded by the increased speculative activity in the financial markets, which can greatly exaggerate the impact of external events on the market — such as geopolitical and related concerns about future supply disruptions — to the detriment of producers and consumers alike and with likely repercussions further afield in the global economy.

[Slide 8] In the face of these challenges, OPEC has demonstrated time and again its commitment to market stability, with secure supplies and reasonable prices that are consistent with healthy economic growth, especially in the developing countries. Indeed, this commitment lies at the heart of OPEC's very existence. Our Organization's first resolution, adopted at our formative meeting in Baghdad in September 1960, refers to the assurance of ""an efficient, economic and regular supply"" of petroleum to consumers. This principle is enshrined in the OPEC Statute, adopted in 1961, and has remained a guiding light for our Organization ever since.

These founding principles have also served as the basis for the development of OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy, which was adopted last September to provide a coherent, consistent vision as well as framework for OPEC’s future efforts.

The OPEC Long-Term Strategy recognises the important role of oil in meeting expected global energy demand as well as providing for the socio-economic development of OPEC Member Countries. The core objectives for the Strategy are to ensure the long-term petroleum revenues of Member Countries, the stability of the world oil market with reasonable prices, and the security of regular supply to consumers, as well as the security of world oil demand.

However, these objectives face a number of key challenges. A major hurdle relates to the uncertainties surrounding future demand for oil in general and OPEC oil in particular, stemming from future world economic growth, consuming countries' policies, technology development as well as from future non-OPEC production levels.

[Slide 9] In an effort to deal with these uncertainties, OPEC’s Long Term Strategy considers three possible scenarios regarding the future developments in the global energy scene. The first is a Dynamics-as-Usual, where global economic growth is robust but no different to average growth rates observed over the past 15 years. In this scenario, oil demand increases by an average of 1.5 mb/d annually, with around three-quarters of the increase to 2020 coming from developing countries. The transportation sector is the single most important source of this increase and represents close to half of future oil demand. Within the freight component of this sector, road transport has the largest contribution of around 70%.

However, depending on developments in the world economy, global oil demand growth could turn out to be considerably different, rising 5 mb/d more than the base case in a persistent tight market scenario or falling 7 mb/d lower if the market remains soft for an extended period. Thus, these scenarios show a considerable range of uncertainty around 12 mb/d, although it should be stressed that the risks are predominately on the downside.

[Slide 10] In addition to economic growth, the energy policies of consuming countries are another factor greatly affecting oil demand. Taxation of energy products is often seen as a means of raising revenue and generally demonstrates a significant discrimination against oil. For example, in the four major European Union economies of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, around two-thirds of the price of a litre of unleaded gasoline goes to the governments in taxes. It should be noted that the substantial sums generated by such taxes are not spent on improving the transportation infrastructure, despite the pressing need to ease traffic bottlenecks, which themselves cause a substantial waste of fuel and unnecessary pollution.

[Slide 11] I know that members of the IRU like to say that the very last drop of oil in the world will be used for transportation. While this may be true, I am happy to inform you that such a day won’t be coming any time soon. Oil resources are large and sufficient, and will be able to meet the needs of consumers for many decades to come.

Over the longer-term, OPEC will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel demanded. However, the uncertainties over future oil demand and non-OPEC supply translate into a broad range of levels of demand for OPEC oil of as much as 10 mb/d or more. [Slide 12]This complicates the planning for appropriate and timely investments in OPEC countries and, consequently, increases the risks associated with under- as well as over-investment.

[Slide 13] The need for appropriate investments is not just confined to the upstream but instead extends along the entire supply-chain, particularly the downstream. Given current trends, tightness in the downstream sector could be expected to remain a potential source of volatility, especially if the necessary investment in the refining sector is not undertaken in a timely manner. [Slide 14] Of course, it is important to remember that the primary responsibility for downstream investments remains with major consuming countries and international oil companies.

[Slide 15] Given the central role played by transportation in expected oil demand growth, OPEC has worked hard to enhance its capabilities in analysing and forecasting fuel consumption in the transportation sector. A recent workshop organized by the Secretariat highlighted a number of important issues concerning transportation sector, which is expected to remain a major source of demand growth for the foreseeable future. Vehicle ownership is set to rise throughout the world, but particularly in developing countries, where the potential for increase is obviously very large. [For example, Chinese ownership alone is expected to rise to 110 per 1000 inhabitants in 2030 from just 20 in 2002.]

Efforts by governments in consuming countries to reduce oil’s share of primary energy consumption through fuel substitution have had less impact in transportation than in the two other principal sectors — power generation and the residential/commercial/agricultural sector. This is because no true viable economic substitute has been found for transportation in the abundant — and relentlessly growing — quantities that are required.

This has not been for want of trying, as far as consuming countries are concerned. Indeed, over the past two decades, many government programmes around the world have encouraged the use of substitute fuels in the transportation sector. While these programmes have resulted in annual growth rates for substitute fuels that are much higher than for oil in the transportation sector, the overall share of substitute fuels in road transportation remains marginal, at around 2%. As a result, gasoline and diesel are expected to continue to dominate the transportation sector. In the meantime, it should be noted that environmental impact of the products used in transportation have been improved dramatically over the past, and this trend was set to continue in the future, with developing countries expected to approach the standards set elsewhere.

[Slide 16] Although increases in demand in the transportation sector have given rise to calls for reductions in CO2 emissions, the fact remains that the major source for CO2 emissions is from stationary sources, such as power stations. As a result, rather than taxes on road transport, governments should focus efforts on promoting carbon dioxide capture and storage technology which could be used to dramatically reduce emissions from where it is most needed and most practical — at power plants and other stationary sources.

[Slide 17] While the workshop taught us many things regarding the transportation sector, it also made us keenly aware of how much more there is to know. This brings me to the ongoing dialogue between OPEC and the IRU. Over the past two years, OPEC has met with top officials from the IRU on several occasions to share information and exchange views on many issues of mutual interest. This has been at several venues, including the visit to the OPEC Secretariat by a delegation led by the IRU Secretary General.

These exchanges provide an excellent example of one crucial element of OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy, which is dialogue—dialogue among producers and between producers and consumers such as the IRU. It is through dialogue that we are able to share our concerns as well as identify areas of common ground. For this reason, OPEC seeks to widened and deepen its dialogue with other players in the market to cover more issues of mutual concern and to further understanding of the positive role that OPEC plays in the world at large.

"2019-03-08","​Friends, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is sincerely a great pleasure to address such a distinguished audience over lunch today. I would like to thank my friend, Sarah Ladislaw, Senior Vice President and Director Energy & National Security Program, and all the team at Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), for helping put this together.

​I would like also like to thank another friend, John Hess from the CSIS Board of Trustees, for his generous introduction. His wise guidance, and great sincerity to me personally, and to OPEC as an Organization, is always immensely appreciated.

​It is truly a great honour to again be at this prestigious institute of international policy and research, which has for more than half a century provided leaders with strategic insight and advice on world affairs.

​We commend you on the valuable and often groundbreaking work you have produced over the years and that you continue to do today.

​It is also a distinct privilege to be here in this vast and beautiful country, which has played such a pivotal role in the history of the oil industry. The United States is considered the home of the first commercially drilled oil well. Thanks to the genius and ingenuity of Edwin Drake, oil was extracted from a deep well near Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859, sparking an oil boom that would change the world.

​I think we can all appreciate the history of the modern oil industry has been littered with tremendous opportunities, as well as huge challenges; large booms, and major busts; and it has attracted many great pioneers and innovators.

​It is a fascinating, some might say rollercoaster history; one that has fashioned many distinguished and celebrated accounts chronicling its remarkable story.

​What this history shows us, even going back to the times of Edwin Drake, is the vital importance of sustainable market stability.

​We have seen plenty of ups and downs for the oil industry in the decades that followed, too many to fully elaborate on over a lunch!

​It is clear that cycles are part of the market’s ever evolving nature and we cannot eliminate the ups and downs of these altogether. However, we can look to help smooth the passage of the cycles through focusing on a balanced market, and helping support a stable environment.

​It is also important to remember that cycles today have a far wider and greater impact than they did during the times of Edwin Drake.

​Today, the size, scope, and complexity of the global oil market make it almost unique among physical commodities. Currently close to 100 million barrels of oil are produced and consumed every day, and over 60 million barrels are exported. Moreover, the importance of oil and the crucial role that it plays globally make it perhaps the most strategic growth engine of the global economy.

​Oil is the lifeblood that fuels the current civilization and keeps modernization moving.

​This further reinforces the point I made earlier: the true scale of the industry and its strategic value to both producers and consumers underscores the importance of sustainable oil market stability.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​At this juncture, I would like to take you back to my last visit to CSIS in December 2016.

​It was still a dark time for the industry, which had been greatly impacted by the severe three-year downturn from 2014-2016.

​However, if you permit me to say, there was a chink of light. My visit came only a few days after we had put together the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ in Vienna between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations.

​The US was our first port of call, which underscores the importance we attach to the relationship between the US, OPEC and the global oil industry.

​The goal of the voluntary production adjustments in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ was to stimulate and accelerate the drawdown of the huge stock overhang, expedite the rebalancing of the market, restore a sustainable stability to the industry and enable investments to return.

​It was a decision taken in the interests of both producers and consumers and to help restore confidence to the market.

​I recall that I was greeted with some sceptism, not only here in the US, but elsewhere too, about the idea of bringing on board non-OPEC nations to take part in the market rebalancing process and on delivering on the stated objectives.

​I am happy to be here over two years later and deliver the scorecard to CSIS and say that those sceptics were mistaken.

​It took us around 18 months to return OECD inventory levels to the five-year average, our stated metric.

​Moreover, when we saw conformity levels to the voluntary production adjustments overshoot in the middle of 2018, we were agile and flexible enough to modify course and stay ahead of the curve.

​When the market has appeared skewed to oversupply, we reacted accordingly, and equally, when concerns were expressed regarding demand outpacing supply, the partners in the ‘Declaration’ took the appropriate action.

​The ‘Declaration’ has had a transformational impact on the global oil industry. The change we have seen over the past two years or so is like night and day.

​These noble efforts have not only received positive comments from producers; we have also heard positive comments from consumers too. To double down on a key message: sustainable oil market stability benefits us all.

​Let me stress that we take a very measured approach through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ – we look at the market outlook, we listen to consumers and other stakeholders, and I assure you that we are focused on the interests of the global economy.

​In terms of current market conditions, since the beginning of the year the market has been slowly, but steadily moving towards a more balanced state and market sentiment has cautiously improved, but we still believe we need to see inventory levels drop further.

​We also recognize the fact that underlying risks remain, such as ongoing trade negotiations, monetary policy developments, as well as increasingly complex geopolitical challenges.

​It underscores the value we place on being flexible and adaptable to changing market conditions, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​Our mission is never accomplished; the challenge of balancing the market is a continuous process.

​We are also fully transparent about what we do. We are an open book. A fish bowl. All our publications and data are available online, accessible via digital Apps to the general public free of charge.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​In examining the relationship between OPEC and the United States, it goes without saying that the US – as the world’s largest oil producer and the largest consumer of oil – is of utmost importance to OPEC.

​We estimate that the US imports around 3 million barrels a day of liquids from OPEC’s Member Countries. And this is out of a total US consumption of almost 21 million barrels a day, and with US liquids supply expected to hit 19 mb/d in the fourth quarter.

​This makes the US a vital customer and partner for our Member Countries.

​Thus, it is my hope that our meetings and consultations while I am here in Washington DC, and at CERAWeek in Houston next week, will further deepen the dialogue between our Organization and the US at all levels. Both parties have nothing to lose and everything to gain with this type of dialogue – there is much that binds us together.

​In this regard, particularly given the importance of the oil industry to the US and OPEC, it is vital to broach some common challenges.

​One major challenge relates to climate change, and the advancement of climate-related financial disclosures that have potential to significantly impact investment into our industry.

​Today there is a picture being formed that oil and gas should be viewed as vestiges of the past. There is a worrying and advancing belief among policymakers and regulators, investment houses, and many other stakeholders that we are an industry that does not have a future. This misrepresents market realities and is grossly misleading.

​To put it simply: our industry face a crisis of perception. It is vital we lay out the facts and do not let pressure and hype blur the pathway to a sustainable energy future for all.

​Let me stress that OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, which remains the only viable global framework to address climate change.

​As I mentioned at COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, last December, the oil industry must be part of the solution to the climate change challenge. We believe that ‘there is no Planet B.’ We are all responsible citizens of this planet.

​Thus, we need to be realistic about how future energy demand growth, which according to our latest World Oil Outlook is expected to expand by a robust 33% by 2040, can be achieved in a sustainable way. This needs to balance the needs of people in relation to their social welfare – with energy poverty still a blight on the lives of billions of people – the economy and the environment.

​In some quarters, we hear stories that suggest renewables are our only energy future. This is again clearly misguided.

​Renewables are coming of age, with wind and solar, expanding fast, but even by 2040 they are only estimated to make up around 19% of the global energy mix.

​Some may argue with this percentage, but it is important to note that we have not seen any reputable outlook suggesting that renewables will come anywhere close to overtaking oil and gas in the coming decades.

​Let me also stress that many OPEC Member Countries have great sources of solar and wind, and significant investments are being made in these fields, just as they are in the US.

​What this means in terms of oil and gas is that there is no doubt that they will remain central to supplying an expanding global population with the critical energy it needs.

​In our Outlook, by 2040 oil has an expected share of around 28% in the global energy mix, and gas is at 25%.

​Long-term oil demand is expected to reach nearly 112 mb/d in 2040. We see no peak oil demand for the foreseeable future. The IEA and the EIA share similar conclusions.

​On top of this, we should also remember that oil producers and companies must invest heavily simply to offset the impact of natural decline rates. The general consensus is of an annual decline rate of 5%, which suggests that the industry needs to add over 4 mb/d each year to just maintain current production levels.

​This is all brought home by the scale of the investment requirements. Oil-related investments across the upstream, midstream and downstream are estimated at around $11 trillion in the period to 2040.

​We also need to recall that exploration and production spending fell by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016, and only increased by 8% in both 2017 and 2018.

​This only adds to the worry that if our industry is concerned about policies that detrimentally impact oil and investments, with talk of stranded assets and declining values of oil; then we have a potentially dangerous scenario, one that could increase volatility significantly and lead to a future energy shortfall.

​Additionally, as often noted by Bob Dudley, BP’s CEO, we need to emphasize this is not a race to renewables alone; it is a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

​We believe that we need to constantly improve the environmental footprint of all the energies we use.

​For oil and gas, the environmental challenge is not oil and gas themselves. It is the emissions that come from burning them.

​In OPEC, we are firm believers that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions.

​In this regard, I welcome coordinated action within the industry, governments and through various research and development platforms, such as the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative. It is vital that we collectively develop and adopt technologies, as well as all-inclusive energy policies, that would address carbon emissions, not crowd out investments in oil.

​We need to remind all stakeholders that oil and gas is responsible for much of today’s economic growth, development and prosperity, and a long-term investment in our industry should be viewed as both prudent and profitable.

​It was the late, great US President, Ronald Reagan, who said: “The future doesn't belong to the faint-hearted. It belongs to the brave.”

​While the times we live in often appear turbulent and the challenges daunting, experience has repeatedly shown us that the enduring principles of cooperation and the audacity to try something new, such as the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, can bring about some measurable success.

​OPEC and non-OPEC participants in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ took a brave step at the end of 2016, and we fully believe that the rebalancing of the market and the focus on a sustainable stability over the past two years or so has been beneficial to the global oil industry, and to both producers and consumers.

​As an industry, one that is vital to both the US and OPEC, we also need to be brave. We need to continually break down barriers; we cannot work in silos if we are going to change misconceived perceptions and make our voices heard. After all, we are all in the same boat.

​We need to ensure that this vital global resource continues to fuel the world, in a secure, reliable, and ever-cleaner manner.

​With that I look forward to your questions.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/104-8-march-2019.html"
"2019-03-07","​Friends, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is an enormous pleasure to be with you here today at the headquarters of the Atlantic Council to discuss some of the most critical issues in the realm of international energy matters.

​This is my second visit to the Headquarters of the Atlantic Council, having also attended a private luncheon back in March 2017. I would like to thank the great people at the institution, ably and skillfully led by Frederick Kempe, President and CEO, and from the Global Energy Center, Ambassador Richard L. Morningstar, Founding Chairman, Randolph Bell, Director, and his hard-working and attentive team.

​Perhaps, now more than ever before, the world needs the guiding principles at the heart of the Atlantic Council: international cooperation; innovative thinking; fact-based policy making; the generation of bold ideas and the multitude of benefits that come from reaffirming historical alliances.

​Let me stress that OPEC shares these values. Our encouragement of international cooperation and support of the multilateral system are ‘front and centre’ of everything our Organization stands for and the actions we take.

​Given our common values and shared interests, I welcome the opportunity to share perspectives with you today and encourage exploring all other possibilities for further strengthening relations between our two Organizations.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Next month, OPEC celebrates a very special and historically significant occasion. We will commemorate the 60-year anniversary of the First Arab Petroleum Congress, which took place in Cairo, Egypt. On the margins of this event, two kindred spirits, Venezuela’s Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo and Saudi Arabia’s Abdullah al-Tariki who had originally met as students in the US, sat down with representatives from Iran, Kuwait and Iraq, at the Maadi Yacht Club in Cairo.

​There the ‘Gentlemen’s Agreement’ of Maadi was forged, which encouraged the signatories’ governments to establish a formal consultation commission as a means of countering the arbitrary decisions of oil companies and sought to secure better concession terms for oil producing countries.

​It was what I might term a first ‘crossroads moment’ for our Organization.

​The unstoppable momentum generated in Cairo would eventually culminate in the foundation of OPEC in Baghdad on 14 September 1960 by the five founding fathers of our Organization: Abdullah al-Tariki; Perez Alfonzo; Fuad Rouhani of Iran; Dr. Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq; and Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait.

​It was perhaps no coincidence that a US citizen, the legendary energy reporter, Wanda Jablonski, also played an important role in bringing these five founders together, helping bring about the initial consultations in Cairo.

​I think this, alongside the fact that Alfonso and al-Tariki first met in the US, is symbolic of the crucial, interactive role that OPEC and the oil industry in the US would have over the subsequent six decades. I also believe it represents how our fortunes are closely intertwined.

​OPEC has a vested interest in sustained US economic growth and prosperity. We are friends of the US. Equally, I feel that the US stands to benefit when OPEC prospers. OPEC’s Statute and mission is to help achieve a sustainable stability in the oil market; and this is not stability for stability’s sake: this is because we are cognizant of the diverse range of economic and social benefits that came from sustainable oil market stability.

​When we succeed in our mission, this benefits both US producers and consumers.

​One of the clearest examples of the interconnected nature of our fortunes was during the last global energy market downturn, what some call the ‘Great Bust’ of 2014-2016. This downturn was as devastating for OPEC Member Countries as it was for US producers, especially tight oil producers.

​I would like to commend the author Bethany McClean who vividly described the impact of the bust on the US industry in her book, ‘Saudi America’.

​The consequences of the downturn were various: the rig count in the US fell from 1,920 rigs in late-2014 to a low of 480 in early-2016. This is a huge drop of around 75%! By mid-2016, US oil production had declined by a staggering 1 mb/d. Two hundred companies would declare bankruptcy in this country as a result of the bust, with huge corresponding negative multiplier effects on the economy.

​With shale companies looking to reduce expenditure, fracking equipment was idled and as IHS Markit research has shown, close to 60% of the fracking equipment in the US was inactive during 2016.

​OPEC Member Countries were not insulated. Revenues fell significantly and national and corporate budgets had to be readjusted. Foregone oil revenues were in the region of $1 trillion!

​At the global level the figures were also stark. Investments were choked-off, with exploration and production spending falling by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016, and only recovered by 8% in both 2017 and 2018. Additionally, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued.

​Moreover, according to the consulting firm Graves & Co, the global oil and gas industry shed almost half a million jobs.

​Of course, these factors rippled through the global economy. Millions of pensions were put at risk, especially in the US, as pension funds had invested in high yield debt, such as energy firms, and private equity firms that were heavily invested in shale companies.

​Given all these factors, it is small wonder that the British economic historian Adam Tooze has concluded:

​“In 2015-16 the world dodged a third instalment of the global crisis.”

​It is far from hyperbole, then, when I say emphatically that our industry was resuscitated from its ‘death bed’ by the collective efforts of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process.

​As a result of our voluntary production adjustments, a long absent element of stability was reintroduced to the market. The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ became an integral and responsible feature of the energy market.

​In the interests of ensuring our noble efforts were conveyed transparently to the market, participating countries also developed effective monitoring mechanisms: the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, supported by its Joint Technical Committee and my team at the OPEC Secretariat. This was the first time this occurred in the history of oil.

​On the back of the stability generated by the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, the US oil industry has been revived. From the depths of despondency and despair, we now have an industry that is thriving again. Last year, with production booming, the US became the largest oil producer in the world. At the end of last year it was at 11.85 mb/d, and now sits at over 12 mb/d.

​If you asked producers in the US shale basins whether they have benefitted from the actions taken through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, I am sure the answer would be a resounding ‘yes’.

​I should also like to add here that without the US shale revolution in the first part of this decade the world would have witnessed major energy chaos.

​It underscores the importance of the US and OPEC to the global oil industry and the fact that we both have a strategic stake in global supply and demand levels.

​The past two years or so of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ and the recovery of the oil industry also came at the same time the global economy picked up too. This was apparent in the conclusions of the IMF in a publication entitled ‘The Global Economic Recovery 10 years after the Financial Meltdown’:

​“After faltering at time over the past 10 years, the global economic recovery experienced a long awaited synchronized growth upswing in 2017-18.”

​Looking ahead, the world will need more oil from both OPEC and the US.

​According to OPEC’s flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook, long term oil demand is expected to rise to 111.7 mb/d in 2040. There is no expectation for peak oil demand over the forecast period to 2040. The IEA, the EIA and OPEC share this consensus.

​To put this into an investment perspective, the required global oil sector investment to 2040 is estimated at $11 trillion.

​What all this emphasizes is that while the short-term focus remains on maintaining market balance and stability, it is also vital that we do not lose sight of the medium- and longer term outlook. All timeframes are inter-linked; what happens in the short-term will have knock-on impacts for the industry’s prospects.

​Such timeframes and numbers highlight the fact that oil will continue to play a critical role in the energy transition.

​A clear exemplification of this is the petrochemical industry. Our Outlook, in line with other forecasting agencies, sees global population expanding to 9.2 billion by 2040. To support such growth and feed these additional mouths, there needs to be a high yield per acreage in the agricultural sector – this can only be achieved through nitrogenous fertilizers and other agricultural products that are produced through hydrocarbons.

​As Charlie Munger, the famous entrepreneur, thinker and collaborator with Warren Buffet, has concluded:

​“hydrocarbons as chemical feed stock are probably irreplaceable.”

​Meeting this future demand challenge must of course be done in a sustainable manner, especially given one of the major issues of our time: climate change. At the most recent UN Climate Change Conference COP24 in Katowice, Poland, OPEC reiterated that it remains fully engaged and supportive of the ‘Paris Agreement’.

​In some quarters, however, there is an evolving narrative that the oil industry is on the cusp of a demise.

​This is far from the truth. We need to challenge this misconception, particularly given the climate disclosure drive from the financial community, which is affecting the vital investments into our industry.

​It is perhaps a ‘crossroads moment’ for the oil industry.

​We need to reinvigorate the industry; highlight the great benefits that oil has brought to billions, and the future positive impact it can have on billions of others.

​We need to highlight, as eloquently put by Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA, at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, that carbon emissions from crude oil production by all IOC’s constitute only 4% of emissions worldwide, and compared with other energy types, this proportion is relatively low.

​Moreover, as often noted by Bob Dudley, BP’s CEO, we need to emphasize this is not a race to renewables alone; it is a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

​For this reason, OPEC emphasizes the importance of what sometimes is known as the ‘fifth fuel’ ̶ energy efficiency or as Dan Yergin called it in one of his masterpieces, ‘The Quest’, ‘energy ingenuity’, namely, applying greater intelligence to consumption, and being more clever about how energy is used.

​Of course, the great enabler of improvements in energy efficiency is technological innovation.

​We need to stress that the scale of the climate challenge means that no single energy source is a panacea; nor can the contribution of an entire industry or group of countries be overlooked.

​The oil industry possesses know-how and experience for reducing our environmental footprint: working practices and fuel efficiency standards have improved exponentially over the decades.

​Of course, more needs to be done. Nevertheless, the industry’s capacity for technological innovation must be harnessed within this process.

​OPEC, the US oil industry, and the entire global oil industry, are part of the solutions to a sustainable energy future.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​At the end of last year, when analysts and commentators were looking to the year 2019, one word kept being repeated: uncertainty. Uncertainty related to heightened trade negotiations; the easing of monetary tightening by several central banks; geopolitical developments; the impact of sanctions; the continuing prevalence of populism – the list goes on.

​Yet in this world of uncertainty, I can assure that one thing is steadfast, unchanging and completely unwavering. And that is the resolve of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ partners to maintain a balanced oil market and achieve a sustainable stability, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​Moreover, following the proven success of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, participating countries are organizing in 2019 a permanent intergovernmental platform for dialogue, under the Charter of Cooperation between Oil Producing Countries, a forum that will ensure constant conversation between countries about salient energy issues.

​We will persevere because it is the right thing to do. As one of the greatest sons of this country, John F Kennedy, said: we undertake our actions,

​“not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone.”

​And as I have stressed throughout my remarks today, it is in the interests of both the US and OPEC to see a vibrant and flourishing oil industry in the decades ahead.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/105-7-march-2019.html"
"2019-02-27","​Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,

​It is a great pleasure to return to Riyadh for this ninth edition of the IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.

​I’d like to thank HE Khalid A. Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, for his magnificent articulation of the importance of this symposium. We all remain indebted to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, not only for today’s generous hospitality but also the country’s tireless devotion to promoting international cooperation and oil market stability.

​As a leading light for the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation,’ HE Al-Falih has repeatedly demonstrated his impeccable credentials as an extremely hard-working statesman, well-versed in the art of oil diplomacy and indeed a great achiever in his career. These qualities have ensured that under his chairmanship, OPEC’s Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee has evolved into the essential umbilical cord between OPEC and non-OPEC. No wonder the industry and participating countries breathed a collective sigh of relief when he agreed to continue to chair the JMMC.

​May I also join HE Khalid Al-Falih and HE Sun in welcoming the President of the OPEC Conference, HE Manuel Salvador Quevedo Fernandez, Venezuela’s People's Minister of Petroleum, who arrived in the early hours of this morning to be able to join us. I also would like to welcome HE Shaikh Mohamed Al-Khalifa, Minister of Oil of Bahrain, a strong advocate of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ and strong supporter of OPEC.

​I am delighted to share the floor with the ‘symposiarch’ of our symposium, my twin brother HE Sun Xiansheng, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum. His boundless energy and captivating positivity have elevated the IEF to new levels of accomplishment, admiration and acclaim. Allow me to wish him many more years of selfless service to the IEF and its Member Countries.

​It is also a great pleasure to be joined by Keisuke Sadamori, Energy Markets and Security Director of the IEA, another great advocate of consumer-producer dialogue. Keisuke-san has been a longtime colleague and evergreen friend ̶ an extremely active ambassador for the IEA, who represents the best features of this great Agency.

​Allow me to offer my welcome to all government officials and captains of industry, including representatives from the GECF, KAPSARC, KFAS, and OFID, in attendance today. Your presence will no doubt enrich our discussions.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Energy outlooks are an essential component of our Organizations’ work. Comprehensive, accurate and fact-based analysis is crucial in supporting policy-makers in taking informed decisions, especially in current circumstances.

​Unfortunately, the oil market can often be subjected to forces which are not grounded in fact, especially at times of disconnect between prices and market fundamentals. Sentiment, speculation and even rumors have been known to drive the market. The situation can be further complicated by computerized or automated trading, with algorithms, Big Data and AI playing important roles.

​Energy outlooks are an antidote for this post-factual age. Indeed, our common currency, as it were, is fact-based data.

​Our industry is currently under siege from multiple fronts. Yet, some of these comments have tended to mischaracterize our objectives and misrepresent market realities.

​A classic example of this is the persistent notion that oil is on the verge of demise. According to this belief, renewables are about to completely replace hydrocarbons and those who seek to discuss the nuances of this idea are downplaying the climate challenge.

​At OPEC, we are acutely conscious of the challenge of climate change. Our Member Countries continue to take appropriate policies, implement programmes and projects to tackle the challenges of climate change.

​At the most recent UN Climate Change Conference COP24 in Katowice, OPEC reiterated that it remains fully engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement. Indeed, some of our Member Countries heavily invest in alternative sources of energy. For example, Saudi Arabia plans to generate some 59 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from solar and wind by 2030, and eventually produce upward of 200 GW from renewable sources.

​However, this is not a race to renewables alone; it’s a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, OPEC emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency and its great enabler, technological innovation.

​Given how our industry can be mischaracterized, the need for dialogue is all the greater. Consider the Ancient Greek roots of the word: ‘dia’ meaning through and ‘logos’ meaning reason or speech.

​Dialogue: through reason.

​And reasoned discussion, based on factual analysis, is crucial in this age of ‘alternative facts.’

​Dialogue fosters transparency, which is another priority for our Organization. OPEC truly is an ‘open book.’ All our publications and data are available online, accessible via digital Apps to the general public free of charge.

​Dialogue and transparency are indispensable to the multilateral system. OPEC will always align with the values at the heart of the multilateral system and affirms absolute conformity between its activities and principles, and the ideals of the UN. We are an intergovernmental organization which has been registered at the UN Secretariat since 6 November 1962.

​These noble principles manifest themselves in the historic new chapter heralded in the oil industry through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process. A win-win situation has developed and made a substantial contribution to the synchronous global economic growth seen in 2017-18.

​Intensive discussions on further institutionalizing our cooperation are currently underway, as we finalize the draft ‘Charter of Cooperation.’ Given the achievements to date, it is no wonder that all parties are enthusiastic to further cement our cooperation through a collaborative approach.

​Looking forward, there can be no doubt that with the GCEF, IEF, IEA and OPEC working together, guided by reason, supported by facts, we can continue to meaningfully contribute to the industry and the global economy.

​May this spirit of collegiality guide our discussions today and always.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/106-27-february-2019.html"
"2019-02-11","​Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, friends,

​I am delighted to be able to return to beautiful Cairo to participate in the Egypt Petroleum Show, held under the patronage of His Excellency Abdel Fattah El Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and the President of the African Union. It is a great honor to have Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly launching this prestigious international gathering. Thank you to the organizers for preparing such a wonderful event, especially to my friend, the able Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Tarek El Molla. Under your watchful guidance, the Egypt Petroleum Show has evolved in a short period of time into a highlight on the energy calendar.

​Tarek El Molla is what we call the right peg in the right hole! No wonder the oil industry holds him such high esteem.

​I am very proud to be in the ancient land of pharaohs, the land of the iconic pyramids, the land of Moses Alay Salam, where truly great civilizations took root and some of the first chapters in the epic story of humanity were written.

​It is particularly pleasing to return to this fabulous country at this moment, when it is in the midst of a great ‘Egyptian renaissance’, under President Sisi’s visionary leadership. The stability which has been reintroduced to this nation has improved investor confidence and the country has turned a full page in its journey to sustainable development.

​Today, Egypt is fast becoming a key regional hub for energy and trade as well as a global player in the industry. Over the last few years it has made great strides in discovering and developing its energy resources in a sustainable manner.

​Egypt and OPEC enjoy a very special relationship and it is a personal joy for me that the current leadership of this nation honours that tradition and has elevated it to new heights.

​Prime Minister, Excellencies, fellow delegates,

​In April of this year, we will mark the 60-year anniversary of an historic meeting that took place in Cairo and literally had transformative repercussions for this region, our industry and the world.

​Between 16 and 23 April 1959, at the Engineers Society Building, the first ever Arab Petroleum Congress took place, attracting industry experts from across the region.

​It is important to be conscious of the nature of the oil industry at that time. This preceded the UN General Assembly adopting resolution 1803 on “Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources” on the 14th December 1962. At that time, the industry was dominated by a handful of Western Oil Majors, who controlled all aspects of the supply chain, with minimal involvement by the host countries. Developing nations that were home to such resources did not have a modicum of participation in decisions that profoundly affected our countries.

​In attendance at the Arab Petroleum Congress were two kindred spirits who felt that the situation needed to be reconsidered. Venezuela’s Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo was in Cairo to drum-up support for his idea of a production and stabilization arrangement among oil producing countries. Abdullah al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia wanted to form a committee of oil producing countries that could meet periodically to discuss mutual problems and challenges, and develop unified policies.

​The two men agreed to widen their discussions and together with representatives from Iran, Kuwait and Iraq, they met towards the end of the conference at the Maadi Yacht Club. There the ‘Gentlemen’s Agreement’ of Maadi was forged, which encouraged the signatories’ governments to establish a formal consultation commission as a means of countering the arbitrary decisions of oil companies and sought to secure better concession terms for oil producing countries.

​The unstoppable momentum generated here in Cairo would eventually culminate in the foundation of OPEC in Baghdad on 14 September 1960 by the five founding fathers of our Organization: al-Tariki; Perez Alfonzo; Fuad Rouhani of Iran; Dr. Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq; and Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait. Cairo was therefore the incubator for OPEC, which was delivered in Baghdad a year later.

​I’ve often reflected on the question why Cairo provided such an inspiring setting which would allow this idea to flourish and excel, and I think the answer is best summed up by legendary OPEC veteran reporter Wanda Jablonski. In her summation of the Arab Petroleum Congress she said,

​“If it wasn’t for the Romantic Nile setting and the Arabic language, this could have been just another routine session.”

​In these awe-inspiring surroundings, the founders of our Organization were motivated to show the imagination, ingenuity and creative brilliance to do something extraordinary. OPEC will always remember the debt owed to Egypt for the role it played in facilitating the birth of our Organization.

​Of course, this was only the beginning of the enduring bonds of friendship between OPEC and Egypt. Aside from incubating our Organization, Egypt has been a regular attendee and supporter at OPEC meetings since the 1980s, and has consistently heeded OPEC’s call for all stakeholders to work together to surmount common challenges. Moreover, Cairo hosted the 133rd (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference on 10 December 2004.

​More recently, Egypt through Tarek El Molla participated actively in our joint efforts with other non-OPEC partners to write a new, glorious chapter in the ever-evolving history of oil.

​Egypt has been to OPEC the very definition of an all-weather friend. For this reason, on behalf of our entire Organization, allow me to say ‘Maa Khalis Shukri wa tagdiri.’

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Throughout our 60 years of existence, OPEC has always faced daunting, if not overwhelming odds. Its creation contravened decades of convention of how the oil industry should conduct itself. The Organization’s creation also defied the Majors, who were under the control of the established powers at that time.

​In those six decades since the Maadi Pact the world has seen profound changes and OPEC has confronted many challenges: the energy crisis of the 1970s; the oil glut of the 1980s; the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s; the Great Recession of the late 2000s, following the global financial crisis; geopolitical tensions; war between two Founding Members of our Organization; the invasion of a Founding Member; natural catastrophes; sudden shifts in market fundamentals – to put it mildly, it’s been an eventful journey!

​And yet, despite all of these obstacles and profound challenges and notwithstanding the fact that some commentators have scribed the Organization’s obituary many times; not only has OPEC survived, it continues to flourish. As one insightful industry commentator put it when they paraphrased the great humourist Mark Twain,

​“The reports of OPEC’s death have been greatly exaggerated.”

​Membership has expanded from those five Founding Members to the 14 Member Countries we have today. Time after time, the Organization has demonstrated its relevance, responsibility and respectability.

​It is perhaps apt to ask the question: what would the world have been without OPEC? Time after time OPEC has taken a proactive stance at times of supply shortfalls, geopolitical turmoil and financial crises.

​On occasions it has helped rescue the global economy, and there is no doubt that the formation of OPEC, and its continued existence, has been beneficial to both producers and consumers, oil companies, and the global industry at large.

​Perhaps one of the clearest manifestations of OPEC’s durability has been the response to the severe market downturn 2014-2016; one of the worst downturns in the industry’s history. As David Kreisman, at the credit rating agency Moody’s put it in September 2016:

​“When all the data is in, including 2016 bankruptcies, it may very well turn out that this oil and gas industry crisis has created a segment-wide bust of historic proportions.”

​I am sure you will all recall the dark clouds that pervaded our industry back then, as they took a devastating toll on global economic growth. Several emerging economies were in the midst of a recession, being battered by the collapse in commodity prices. As the economic historian Adam Tooze wrote,

​“In 2015-16 the world dodged a third instalment of the global crisis.”

​What was the OPEC response to this impending catastrophe of epoch-defining proportions? After painstaking consultations and negotiations, we forged an alliance with 10 non-OPEC producers to create the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation,’ signed on 10 December 2016. For the first time in the long history of our industry, 24 oil-producing countries came together voluntarily to take concerted action to work to bring sustainable stability to our oil market.

​In the interests of ensuring our actions were conveyed transparently to the market, participating countries developed effective monitoring mechanisms: the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, supported by its Joint Technical Committee and the OPEC Secretariat. It was openness of this scale which allowed the market to recover and make a meaningful contribution to the synchronous global economic upsurge witnessed in 2017-18.

​As was the case with the foundation of OPEC, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ was initially met with skepticism upon its formation. Some industry commentators thought that the OPEC and non-OPEC partnership would not last, hold together or honour its commitments.

​And, as was the case with OPEC, the cynics have been proven wrong. The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has evolved into a permanent feature of the energy landscape. This has been for the benefit of producers, consumers, and, unquestionably, the global economy, as this extraordinary group of producing countries has spared no effort in contributing to market stability.

​Such has been the success of our Cooperation that there is tremendous appetite among participating countries to further institutionalize this relationship. At the 175th OPEC Conference and the 5th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 6th and 7th December 2018, there was an initial endorsement of a draft ‘charter’ which would provide a framework for our future work. Indeed next week in Vienna, a further meeting will take place to discuss this ‘Charter of Cooperation.’

​Turning to current conditions in the oil market, I am pleased to report signs of more confidence and optimism are gradually but steadily returning to the market and our industry.

​Particularly important in reducing the downside supply risk in the oil market has been the proactive and early output adjustments by the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ partners. As a result, the OECD stock overhang is targeted to reign in towards the latest five-year average. Once again, the participating countries have demonstrated their selflessness, dedication and commitment to implementing their voluntary, collective decisions in a transparent and verifiable manner.

​However, a great deal of uncertainty that is beyond the capacity of any one stakeholder to control still remains. Geopolitical tensions, the impact of sanctions, the fact that the risk of a recession has not completely abated ̶ these factors could continue to impact the market throughout 2019.

​Nevertheless, the Declaration of Cooperation partners remain steadfast in their determination to take the necessary action to stabilize the market during the course of the year.

​When recounting this history, a few questions naturally pose themselves.

​Why has OPEC survived all this time, in spite of the ups and downs, the highs and lows, the tumultuous global events?

​How is it that the Organization continues to thrive and is even stronger today than at any other stage in its 60 year history?

​They are questions I’ve reflected on a lot. And my conclusion is that the key to OPEC’s longevity lies in the fact that at its core, OPEC has a clear and simple objective. This objective serves producers as much as it does consumers. And this objective has a vast array of multiplier effects. This objective, this raison d'être, can be surmised in just 4 words: sustainable oil market stability.

​OPEC does not seek stability for stability’s sake: rather we are acutely conscious of the broader social and economic benefits for all which come as a result of sustainable oil market stability.

​The clarity of our goal has sustained us in good times and bad. It is the vision which guided Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso, Abdullah al-Tariki, Fuad Rouhani, Tala’at al-Shaibani and Ahmed Sayed Omar nearly 60 years ago. It inspires our Member Countries, countries participating in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, our entire staff —indeed, everyone who is a member of the OPEC family.

​At OPEC, we have an open door; we are fully transparent about what we do. This can be viewed in the fact that all our publications and data are available online, and accessible via digital Apps to everybody free of charge.

​We also have numerous dialogues with both producers and consumers. Let me stress that our faith in international dialogue and the multilateral system, based on the core principles of equity, fairness and transparency remains at the core of our value system.

​I have no doubt that the same commitment, focus and drive will guide OPEC’s work for the next 60 years and beyond.

​These principles have also infused the historic relations between OPEC and Egypt and may they infuse the Egypt Petroleum Show over the coming days and years.

​Thank you for your kind attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/107-11-february-2019.html"
"2018-12-18","​Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​Bom Dia.

​It is both a pleasure and privilege to be in the great nation of Angola this morning. Angolan hospitality is world-renowned, and my team and I have really been reminded why this is the case during our time here. I would like to sincerely thank our gracious hosts and, in particular, my good friend His Excellency, Dr. Diamantino Pedro Azevedo, Minister of Mineral Resources and Petroleum. Also thank you Excellency, for your kind words of introduction.

​Since assuming his position, the Minister has been a tremendous asset to the OPEC family, diligently applying his broad experience and knowledge to our ongoing efforts at OPEC. I thank and commend him most heartily for this. Thank you to Mr. Carlos Saturnino, CEO of the Sonangol Group and all other colleagues in the Ministry who have made this visit possible.

​I also extend a warm welcome to esteemed members of Parliament, all Ministers, dignitaries, officials, and other government ministries, captains of industry, colleagues in the private sector and other interested parties in attendance for this lecture. I am very glad to see you all.

​I must confess to having a very personal affinity to this country which extends beyond the bonds of African fraternity. Angola’s membership of OPEC began on 1 January 2007, but of course, the negotiations that led to this milestone event took place throughout 2006, at a time when Nigeria held the Presidency of the OPEC Conference. During that year, I had the tremendous honour of serving as Acting Secretary General of the Organization.

​Indeed, Angola was formally admitted to the OPEC family in Abuja at the 143rd (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference!

​Needless to say, Angola becoming a Member Country was a tremendous boon for OPEC. A new source of positive energy and dynamism was injected into the Organization, as we benefitted from the experience of an extremely important regional player from central and southern Africa.

​Angola’s accession in 2006 was the first new addition to OPEC since my own country, Nigeria joined in 1971. This had enormous repercussions, the ramifications of which are still being felt today. Regional neighbours saw Angola make a success of its membership and in due course, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, would enter the OPEC fold.

​Furthermore, Angola’s membership after a 36 year hiatus on expanding the Organization, proved that reaching out and embracing new partners yields results. This spirit of collegiality among nations, willingness to try things differently, innovation and honoring one’s commitments has also been at the core of OPEC’s recent cooperation with its non-OPEC partners under the umbrella of the “Declaration of Cooperation.”

​Therefore, history will conclude that Angola joining the OPEC family was a precursor to membership of our Organization increasing, a strengthening of the African voice in our decision-making structures and this new era of cooperation among oil producing countries through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation.’ So, given this context you can understand my absolute joy at our being with you today.

​The timing of this Mission is also extremely exciting. At OPEC, we follow with great interest and admiration the very commendable reform agenda of President João Manuel Gonçalves Lourenço, particularly as he seeks to modernise the oil industry, improve transparency and good governance.

​Undoubtedly, President Lourenço has achieved a series of notable successes, which have improved the industry’s efficiency and effectiveness. We commend the President’s decision to create a new Agency and separation of conflicting roles of policy, regulation, and commercial operation, in line with the best international practices.

​OPEC also welcomes Angola’s efforts to upgrade, and expand its refinery sector and we stand ready to provide whatever technical advice and expertise that we can, in this regard.

​Another area of intense activism on the part of the President which strongly resonates with the ethos and philosophy of OPEC is his commitment to international cooperation and the multilateral process.

​It gladdened my heart when President Lourenço told the UN General Assembly in September of this year that Angola supports:

​“All efforts to promote cooperation among the nations of the whole world, consolidate peace and defense for cooperation, trade and investment relations at the bilateral and multilateral levels.”

​This fits ‘hand-in-glove’ with OPEC’s raison d'être. As an intergovernmental organization, we strongly share the view that cooperation among nations remains the most effective problem-solving mechanism at our disposal.

​Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

​When you listen to any OPEC official speak; if you read any of our publications, statements, or press releases; if you examine our statute; you will see our core objective repeated over and over again: oil market stability on a sustainable basis. This goal drives all of our activities, all our actions and almost all our research.

​It is very important that we step back and ask the deceptively simple question: why? Why does oil market stability matter? Why does it motivate OPEC in everything it does? Why does it generate the attention of decision makers and world leaders across the political spectrum?

​Having invested a lot of time reflecting on this, I think the most concise formulation of why oil stability matters hails from the great historian of our industry, Professor Dan Yergin, when he said in his book “The Quest”:

​The industrial civilization that has evolved over the last two and a half centuries rests on a hydrocarbon foundation.

​Such is the importance of oil that it plays an indispensable role in lubricating economic growth, sustainable development and improving the livelihoods of billions of people around the globe. Oil market stability begets prosperity; it is an essential component in fighting poverty. The multiplier effects of oil market stability are immense for other industries and the global economy.

​For example, consider the hard-earned savings of millions of retirees whose fortunes are tied to pension funds that invest in our industry. Think of the sheer number of families dependent on bread-winners employed in our sector and the job opportunities which result from oil market stability.

​OPEC does not seek stability for stability’s sake: rather we are acutely conscious of the broader social and economic benefits for all which come as a result of sustainable oil market stability.

​And when we cast our minds back to the depths of the last downturn in 2015-16, one can only shutter at how close the world came to a catastrophe of epoch defining proportions.

​If you don’t take my word for it, I’d like to quote David Kreisman, Senior Vice President at the credit rating agency Moody’s from September 2016:

​“When all the data is in, including 2016 bankruptcies, it may very well turn out that this oil and gas industry crisis has created a segment-wide bust of historic proportions.”

​This situation came about as a result of the fact that from 2014 to 2016, world oil supply growth outpaced that of oil demand, with world oil supply growing by 5.8 mb/d, while world oil demand increased by 4.3 mb/d.

​By July 2016, OECD commercial stock overhang reached a record high of about 403 mb over the five-year industry average. The OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016.

​Nearly one trillion dollars in investments were either frozen or discontinued, and a record number of companies in our industry filed for bankruptcy. According to the consulting firm Graves & Co., almost half a million jobs were lost in the global oil and gas industry.

​Several emerging economies were in the midst of a recession, being battered by the collapse in commodity prices. As the economic historian Adam Tooze said,

​“In 2015-16 the world dodged a third instalment of the global crisis.”

​OPEC knew it had to act in the face of this potential calamity. Throughout 2016, extensive consultations were undertaken with our non-OPEC partners, aimed at building consensus about the strategic urgency of rebalancing the global oil market in a collective manner.

​Twenty-four (now twenty–five) oil producing nations agreed at the first OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting held on the 10th of December 2016 in Vienna, on a concerted effort to accelerate the stabilization of the global oil market through voluntary adjustments in total production of around 1.8 million barrels per day.

​What would become clearer in time is that one of the greatest inherent strengths of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ was its flexibility, grounded on the core principles of equity, fairness and transparency. Over the last two years, the partners have been able to modify course depending on conditions in the market. When the market appeared skewed to oversupply, we have reacted accordingly, and equally, when consumers expressed concerns regarding demand outpacing supply, the partners in the DoC have taken appropriate action.

​This was best exemplified by the decisions of the 174th OPEC Conference, 22 June 2018, and the 4th OPEC and Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, 23 June, where participating countries decided to strive to adhere to the overall conformity level, voluntarily adjusted to 100%.

​Therefore the DoC should be viewed as an adaptable toolkit to address imbalances in the market.

​The most recent iteration of this ongoing undertaking occurred on 6th and 7th December at the 175th Meeting of the OPEC conference and the 5th Ministerial Meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC.

​Following extensive analysis and deliberations on the immediate oil market prospects and, in view of a growing imbalance between global oil supply and demand in 2019, the partners decided to adjust the overall production by a combined 1.2 mb/d, effective as of January 2019 for an initial period of six months.

​If I was to use a single word to describe the impact of this cooperation on the oil market, it would be: transformative. A long-absent element of stability has been reintroduced. There have been significant changes in industry-wide and public perceptions of OPEC. The Organization has ably demonstrated its credentials as a body committed to international cooperation, working with other producers, honouring its commitments and promoting mutual respect among all nations.

​Bringing together 25 sovereign producing nations is unparalleled in the history of the oil industry. The enhanced relations between participating countries now constitute a fundamental and essential feature of the ‘new world of energy.’

​However, most importantly of all, the multiplier benefits of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ have been immensely significant. This was apparent in the conclusions of the IMF in a publication entitled “The Global Economic Recovery 10 years after the Financial Meltdown”:

​“After faltering at time over the past 10 years, the global economic recovery experienced a long awaited synchronized growth upswing 2017-18.”

​This global economic upsurge has occurred at exactly the same time as the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has been operational. Oil market balance begets prosperity.

​Consider the fact that over the last two years, the global economy has had the assurance from the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ strategic partners that they will take the necessary measures to contribute to a balance between supply and demand. Can one quantify how important this guarantee of responsible leadership, this proactive dependability, has been?

​Throughout this entire process, the partners have solicited and responded to the views and concerns of producers and consumers. We have championed consumer and producer dialogue, benefiting from the tremendous partnership with the IEF. OPEC’s energy dialogues with the EU, Russia, China, India and independent suppliers have further harnessed information exchange and fed into our joint strategies.

​The partners have been responsible and responsive; proactive and professional; adroit and adaptive.

​Excellenceis, Ladies and gentlemen,

​The OPEC family wants to transmit a very important message to Angola: we deeply respect and value Angola’s regional leadership, defense of multilateralism, and support for the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process.

​Working together, there can be no doubt that we can navigate any stormy waters to calmer seas. Committed to the principles of equity, transparency, fairness and respect among nations, we can close a long, dark chapter for the oil industry and write a new one, fulfilling the words of the poet Lord Tennyson when he wrote,

​“The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep moans round with many voices.
​Come my friends, Tis not too late to seek a newer world.”

​Once again, thank you for your attention and generous hospitality.

​Muito obrigado!​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/108-18-december-2018.html"
"2018-12-12","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Dobry wieczór

​I’d like to express our deep appreciation to the Government of Poland, the City of Katowice and the UNFCCC Secretariat for their gracious hospitality.

​Congratulations to State Secretary Michał Kurtyka for valiantly managing the Presidency of COP 24 at this critical juncture.

​Let me begin by stating unequivocally: the oil industry must be part of the solution to the climate change challenge. We too believe that “there is no Planet B.” We are responsible citizens of this planet.

​The scale of the challenge means that no single energy source is a panacea; nor can the contribution of an entire industry or group of countries be overlooked. This is not a race to renewables alone; it’s a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

​The oil industry possesses know-how and experience for reducing our environmental footprint: working practices and fuel efficiency standards have improved exponentially over the decades.

​Of course, more needs to be done. Nevertheless, the industry’s capacity for technological innovation must be harnessed within this process.

​This is particularly the case considering oil’s enabling role in economic growth and social progress. Indeed, oil has fueled our modern civilization. I should emphasize on the facilitative role of international trade, this role should continue.

​Furthermore, energy poverty remains a scourge of our time: today one billion people lack access to electricity and three billion lack clean fuels for cooking.

​An ever cleaner oil industry, driven by technological innovation, can improve the livelihoods of billions of people in a sustainable way.

​We urge Parties (governments) to promote all-inclusive policies that are not discriminatory in content and implementation.

​The corporate world should join hands with governments and civil society in promoting this inclusiveness.

​Appropriate technologies that would address carbon emissions leading to the elimination of these emissions are not beyond reach and are indeed feasible.

​The funding of the R&D of these technologies is the responsibility of both producers and consumers. Our Member Countries are playing their role creditably in this regard to ensure that the over 1.2 trillion barrels of proven oil reserves are not stranded. Oil and gas will continue to account for more than 50% of the global energy mix well beyond 2040.

​The energy transition is therefore not a transition from one energy source to another. All sources of energy are needed to meet current and future demand.

​OPEC and our non-OPEC partners in the Declaration of Cooperation will continue to undertake our obligation in combating Climate Change based on equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

​Thank-you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/109-12-december-2018.html"
"2018-12-07","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good afternoon.

​It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all to the 5th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

​It is once again truly satisfying to see so many OPEC Ministers and other heads of delegation from non-OPEC producing countries here with us today.

​This is a sign that our ground-breaking cooperation continues to go from strength-to-strength.

​I would like to offer a specific thank you to my co-Chair for this meeting, His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. He has been a strong advocate and dedicated leader in the cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC as we have sought to restore the much sought-after balance to the oil market.

​In talking of our cooperation, it is also important to stress that this is a framework for cooperation that remains open to all oil producers.

​I should like to acknowledge a number of additional non-OPEC producers that have joined us today as observers. These are Chad, South Africa, Uzbekistan, as well as the African Petroleum Producers Association.

​Looking ahead, we welcome any new countries to join with us and work responsibly towards a balanced market, and sustaining the ‘hard won’ stability that has been achieved.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Since the beginning of our cooperation back in January 2017, our countries have achieved a great deal of success. We have made a remarkable difference, through your support in a collective, equitable and transparent framework for cooperation.

​Over the past two years, this has been driven by the OPEC and OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings, and adeptly supported by the JMMC, the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) and the OPEC Secretariat.

​These supporting bodies to the ‘Declaration’, alongside the OPEC Secretariat, have shown great fortitude, resolve and commitment in helping achieve the impressive results we have witnessed over the past two years.

​They are insightful and dynamic bodies, producing high quality market analyses and valuable insights.

​Collectively, we have reduced the inventory overhang and brought greater balance to the market. However, we have seen increased market volatility in recent months.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​At the 175th Meeting of the OPEC Conference, we discussed the current oil market situation, the outlook for 2019, and the future evolution of our cooperation. These issues will now be deliberated with Your Excellencies.

​In looking to 2019, it is vital that we all have a clear understanding of the potential impact of developments on supply and demand fundamentals.

​Our focus needs to be on helping maintain the balance that has been achieved, and sustaining the stability that has been realized.

​It is vital that our hard-earned achievements are not compromised or lost.

​It means that collectively we need to examine and assess the outlook for 2019, and develop a viable plan to ensure that jointly we take the necessary action to ensure the market remains balanced.

​In this increasingly complex and interdependent world, at OPEC we believe in the core tenets of collaboration and fraternity among nations as the best solutions to overcoming challenges.

​Our cooperation has come a long way, and we believe it remains vital in 2019, as well as in the years that follow.

​This underscores that we should not lose sight of the significance of further strengthening our cooperation into a broader framework to ensure continuity.

​We need to build on the success that has already been achieved. This is in all our interests.

​I look forward to our deliberations.

"2018-11-22","​Ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is a pleasure to be back here in the bustling European capital of Brussels for this 13th High-Level Meeting of the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue.

​Before I proceed, allow me to recognize and thank our hosts from the European Union, namely Miguel Arias Cañete, Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy from the European Commission. I would also like to extend our words of appreciation to Mr. Dominique Ristori, Director-General at the Directorate General for Energy of the European Commission, who has been instrumental in promoting the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue since its inception. I met him during our Dialogue process in 2006. Allow me to also express my appreciation to the Commissioner’s staff for hosting our proceedings here today.

​Additionally, I would like to thank Her Excellency, Dr. Karin Kneissl, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Austria, for taking the time to be here earlier and express her support for this Dialogue.

​Her presence here has special significance as Austria currently holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union and, of course, is the Host Country for OPEC.

​It is also worth noting, since we are here in the political heart of Europe, that OPEC has been based on this Continent since 1961 when it moved to Geneva after its founding in Baghdad in 1960. From Geneva, OPEC moved its headquarters to Vienna in 1965, where it has been ever since.

​It has indeed been a long and fruitful relationship, and will certainly continue to be so in the years ahead. So, on behalf of OPEC, allow me to say Danke Frau Doktor Kneissl and Danke Austria!

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​The EU-OPEC High-level Dialogue, now in its 13th year, has become a fixed point on our calendars. Since its inception in 2005, we have seen this process of dialogue and cooperation flourish and grow at all levels through the development and evolution of joint activities, workshops, roundtables and reports.

​The recent and momentous developments of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners of the Declaration of Cooperation are a clear demonstration of the vital need for and indeed the power of dialogue and close collaboration among all stakeholders in today’s energy industry.

​The highly successful efforts spurred on by the Declaration of Cooperation virtually rescued a global oil industry that was on the brink of collapse.

​Today, thanks in large part to these heroic efforts, we have a transformed industry — fundamentals are generally back on solid ground, and the market is more stable and optimistic. And this has resulted in a slow but steady reawakening of investment across the industry, providing support to the global economy.

​This brightened outlook does not, however, preclude the recurrence of challenges on the horizon. And, as we have learned over and over again through history, the oil market is cyclical and complex, and one must always be prepared for the unknown.

​While global economic growth remains on solid footing, it does face some potential headwinds. Following a period of relatively synchronized growth, the economic growth trends between, and within, major regions have begun to diverge.

​Although growth in the major OECD economies remains healthy, slowing trends have become apparent in some emerging markets and developing countries, the EMDCs. Contributing factors include some monetary tightening of the G4 central banks, weakening financial reports from some EMDCs, rising global trade disputes and geopolitical challenges.

​With this backdrop, OPEC’s global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 have recently been revised down slightly by 0.1 percentage points to now stand at 3.7% and 3.5%, respectively.

​This could, of course, have repercussions for global oil demand. According to the November edition of the MOMR, world oil demand growth in 2018 is now forecast at 1.50 mb/d. For 2019, projections for growth are lower at 1.29 mb/d. This is mainly due to economic adjustments in the non-OECD region and, more generally, related to uncertainties regarding the overall global economic development.

​Another factor is related to concerns expressed by consumers with regard to the supply outlook, however, OPEC currently views the market as adequately supplied and well-balanced, though in a somewhat fragile state. For 2019, we do see growing potential for imbalance, due to feasibly larger-than-anticipated growth in supply.

​OPEC, as always, will remain vigilant in monitoring the market in the weeks and months ahead to stay on top of the latest developments.

​In the meantime, working closely with like-minded stakeholders and sharing outlooks and viewpoints on industry issues as we are doing here today are of utmost importance.

​Indeed, this is the driving force behind this and the other dialogues that OPEC conducts with international partners such as Russia, China, India and more recently the United States.

​In looking at the agenda, this morning’s session will provide us with a valuable opportunity to look at the short-term and long-term oil and energy market outlooks, as well as some of the latest developments in relation to EU energy and economic policies.

​I am certain that these presentations and deliberations will help to further reinforce the cooperation between our two parties. This exchange of information and outlooks, and the sharing of viewpoints will help us to continue to find common ground and advance mutual understanding, not only of the issues of the day, but of each other’s Organizations and goals.

​Will this in mind, the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue is well positioned to move from strength to strength in the months and years ahead.

​In closing, I wish everyone a productive and fruitful meeting here today.

​Thank you for your attention​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/111-22-november-2018.html"
"2018-11-11","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​It is indeed my distinct honour to welcome you to Abu Dhabi for this 11th Meeting of the JMMC.

​After a very successful 10th JMMC hosted by the Algerian government in the beautiful city of Algiers, the United Arab Emirates is now honoured to host this eleventh edition and show you the unique brand of Emirati hospitality and culture.

​This is a big week ahead, as tomorrow, we kick off the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference, ADIPEC, which will be hosted by the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC, and held under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates.

​We look forward to the participation of both OPEC and non-OPEC Member Countries. In fact, we expect to see around 41 National Oil Companies and International Oil Companies here this week.

​ADIPEC has truly become a magnet in this industry, bringing together a huge diversity of stakeholders each year from all corners of the world. We expect great things to emerge from this year’s edition, and allow me to wish you all a very fruitful participation in next few days.

​But, today, we are here to discuss matters related to the ongoing, successful Declaration of Cooperation and how OPEC and its non-OPEC partners will continue to contribute to a sustainable stability in the global oil market during the months ahead.

​Let me pause for one moment to recognize the Chairman and Co-Chairman of this Committee — HE Khalid A. Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. Their capable leadership and extensive experience continue to inform and drive this Committee’s valuable work.

​Allow me to also thank the OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, and the Secretariat staff for their high-quality input and continuous support for these meetings.

​The Joint Technical Committee should also to be recognized for their ongoing production of key reporting that feeds into our deliberations.

​Chairman, Excellencies, delegates,

​Today, we have an industry that is on much stronger footing than two years ago, when the OPEC and non-OPEC countries embarked on this journey of cooperation. Fundamentals are strong, and we have seen a return of a greater degree of balance to the market. And this, in turn, is supporting investments and the global economy.

​This Committee has been instrumental in fostering this newfound optimism we see today. Steady and vigilant monitoring of the oil market while emphasizing transparency have been the hallmarks of their efforts.

​Though there are still uncertainties on the horizon, many of them beyond our control, this Committee will continue to carry out its mandate with great effectiveness, as it has so ably demonstrated to present.

​One thing is certain, however, this industry, and indeed the world, has witnessed the power of cooperation and dialogue as a means to achieving common goals among like-minded stakeholders.

​My hope is that our discussions here today stay focused on how we can continue to build upon and institutionalize this cooperation. I believe great things are still to come, and all stakeholders will benefit — producers, consumers and the global economy.

​So, allow me to conclude by welcoming you once again here today. I hope you will be able to enjoy the delights of Emirati culture while you are here! I wish you all fruitful discussions.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/112-11-november-2018.html"
"2018-11-11","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​I would like to join the Chairman in acknowledging the students from Khalifa University who represent the bright hope of the future of our industry.

​In 1987, OPEC established a committee of three Member Countries, (Venezuela, Indonesia and Nigeria) to take stock of what was then, the worst oil market downturn in history, which saw prices falling below $10/b in 1986. Our committee was also mandated to tour all Member Countries and meet with their sovereigns to benefit from their guidance on the way forward.

​And it was here in Abu Dhabi that I had the honour of a lifetime, when I met with Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founding Father of the UAE.

​Aside from his graciousness, humility and dignity, which were in abundance, what struck me most about Sheikh Zayed was his foresight, his discernment and how visionary he was.

​On that occasion, Sheikh Zayed gave two indispensable pieces of advice. Firstly, he told us to stay the course. Keep OPEC on the trajectory it was on. The Organization plays a crucial role that benefits a diverse range of stakeholders, producers, consumers and the global economy. He urged Member Countries to retain their cohesion, despite the inevitable ups and downs which may come.

​Secondly, he asked the pertinent question, why was the committee’s itinerary restricted to OPEC capitals? He recommended that we visit and engage with non-OPEC countries as well. Pausing, he added a prophetic comment, “you may need each other in the future.”

​That was 31 years ago. Here we are today, convening a Committee formed as a result of the ongoing collective work of OPEC and non-OPEC to monitor conditions in the market. Sheikh Zayed’s vision lives on. The enduring capacity of cooperation among nations to surmount obstacles remains as relevant in 2018 as it was in 1987.

​It is an honour to be in this great nation in this Year of Zayed, which has allowed us to re-familiarise ourselves with the wise teachings of this legend. And as I re-read many of his sagacious dictums, I found one which is extremely appropriate for the “Declaration of Cooperation” and our work today:

​“We were like those who had climbed a mountain and reached the top. When we looked down, we still wanted to go higher to realise our goals. Despite all the achievements, we still have an ambition for more.”

​Furthermore, I commend in the highest possible terms the co-chairmen of this committee, HE Khalid A. Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. The continued leadership of this innovative organ of the Declaration of Cooperation by these two gentlemen is not only critical to our successes, it also constitutes the umbilical cord between OPEC and non-OPEC. These successes have exceeded the expectations of even the most optimistic of observers and enhanced the integrity of our Organization.

​However, given our location, I would like to pay particular tribute to a very special gentleman who personifies the best features of the strategic partnership between OPEC and non-OPEC. This outstanding Minister, in his capacity as President of the OPEC Conference in 2018, has inspired all of us through his expert diplomacy and mastery of the craft of statesmanship. I speak of course of the illustrious Emirati, HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei. In addition to his extraordinary repertoire of skills, the Minister and his team have been superlative hosts for us this week, including for the prestigious ADIPEC event starting tomorrow. In the well-known and celebrated tradition of the UAE, HE Al Mazrouei remains the epitome of humility.

​So once again, I’d like to thank our gracious Emirati hosts and wish everyone a successful meeting.

​Thank you for your kind attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/113-11-november-2018.html"
"2018-10-29","​Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen:

​I have the distinct pleasure – and possibly the challenge – of speaking to you after a sumptuous lunch, courtesy of our friends at ENI.

​Before I begin, I would like to recognize Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour, CEO of Sonatrach, whose warm words of welcome this morning were highly appreciated.

​Likewise, the keynote speech of the Prime Minister, HE Ahmed Ouyahia, which followed was congenial, evoking the unique greatness of this country, which I’ve had the pleasure of visiting several times.

​As the largest country in Africa – and the 10th largest in the world – Algeria commands attention. Its dynamic growth and transformation over the years is the result of a rich culture and a diverse people. In addition, its struggle for independence and its historic resistance to the status quo have forged a resilient and ever progressive people.

​Much of this, however, would not have been possible without leadership – and a statesman who has been courageous, indefatigable and visionary: President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

​I think a round of applause in appreciation of his lifelong commitment would be in order.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Allow me to briefly mention a few facts that underscore Algeria’s growing importance as an oil and gas producer.

​Since the first commercial oil was discovered here in 1956, the country has become a global hydrocarbons ‘powerhouse’. It now not only plays a leading role in the region but on the global scene as well.

​With more than 200 oil and gas fields in production, Algeria’s proven oil reserves put it among the top three African countries. It is also ranked the third-largest oil producer in Africa and is the Continent’s largest natural gas producer.

​In worldwide terms, Algeria is the 17th largest oil producer and 10th largest gas producer, with more than 60% of its oil and gas exported.

​In OPEC, too, Algeria continues to play a key role. Since it first joined the Organization in 1969, it has been a stalwart.

​In 1975, its capital of Algiers even played host to the 1st Summit of Heads of State and Government of OPEC Member Countries, one of only three such Summits.

​In recent years, too, the country has made other important contributions to OPEC’s work.

​At the onset of the last global financial crisis in 2008, Algeria hosted the landmark Meeting of the Conference leading to the Oran Decision, which saw the Organization downwardly adjust production in a moment of pronounced market volatility.

​More recently, Algeria’s courageous leadership and unflagging advocacy of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ in late 2016 has been well documented and fully acknowledged by OPEC, non-OPEC producers and the global community.

​In fact, last month, during meetings of the JTC and JMMC here in Algiers, we commemorated the Second Anniversary of the ‘Algiers Accord’, which was the first step on the road leading to that Declaration.

​To mark the occasion, OPEC even produced a ‘Special Edition’ of the OPEC Bulletin, paying tribute to the country and its leadership.

​Since then, Algeria has continued to provide support for ongoing consultations among OPEC and non-OPEC producers, which has resulted in a marked transformation in global energy relations on several levels.

​First, there is OPEC’s global role.

​Though some sceptics have imagined a diminished global role for the Organization, OPEC has instead demonstrated permanence and longevity. It has been transformed.

​To paraphrase a famous 19th century humourist, “reports of our demise have been greatly exaggerated.”

​In this process of transformation, OPEC has not only acquired a new image but has shown that it can adapt like the most nimble of corporations.

​Whether one admits it or not, OPEC has taken centre stage – probably more than at any other time in its history.

​There are also ongoing transformations at the level of OPEC’s Member Countries. Many of them have implemented important sectoral reforms over the years, which have helped them navigate through the industry downturn while also positioning them on a path of sustainable growth.

​In some countries, the energy mix has diversified. In others, the application of technological innovations has become more pronounced.

​Other reforms have sought to encourage investments, which remains an important industry priority.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Algeria is no stranger to such transformations. Continuous reforms have produced important changes in the country – and in this, it is necessary to once again recognize the extraordinary role played by HE President Bouteflika.

​He has been a ‘catalyst of change’, spurring modernization, implementing reforms and even pushing forward – in a courageous and innovative manner – with the “national reconciliation” in the early 2000s.

​Leadership at the country’s Ministerial levels has been similarly laudable. I would be remiss if I failed to mention the dedicated men and women of Algeria that have worked with OPEC over the years – beginning with supremely capable, high-level officials like the Minister of Energy, HE Mustapha Guitouni, whose character, commitment and quality know few parallels. Mustapha Guitouni is a technocrat par excellence – and an epitome of humility.

​In addition, it is worth mentioning the efforts the country has made in the area of human resources, particularly for the oil and gas industry. Recognizing the key importance of human capital, Algeria has pursued innovative educational reforms and new training opportunities over the years.

​The results of this and other reforms speak for themselves. Algeria today not only demonstrates oil and gas prowess but counts with an electrical grid that is almost at 100% coverage and its natural gas network provides more than 60% of household coverage. A round of applause for this technocrat par excellence, champion of combating energy poverty, Mustapha Guitouni !!!

​From OPEC’s perspective, continuous reforms are at the heart of the growth and evolution of our Member Countries. – They are also at the core of the transformation of NOCs like Sonatrach.

​Reforms have facilitated the expansion of the oil and gas industry in Member Countries, allowing them to meet national yearnings and aspirations, while meeting the needs of the industry and consumers worldwide.

​It is important to appreciate how far the industry has come. From the drilling of the first commercial oil well in Baku, Azerbaijan in 1846 to the first North American oil well – in Titusville, Pennsylvania – in 1859, innovation and reform, anchored in the application of technology, have consistently driven the industry’s growth.

​Innovations and reforms also helped to transform John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company – originally formed in 1865 – so that by 1879 it controlled 90% of America’s refining capacity, as well as its pipelines.

​Later, other reforms and innovations led to the Spindletop discovery in 1901, which sparked the Texas Oil Boom.

​Meanwhile, in Europe in 1876, Ludwig and Robert Nobel had set up Nobel Brothers Petroleum Company, while the Rothschild family had production and refining capacity in Russia, all driven by innovations, reforms and rapid change.

​Similarly, Royal Dutch Petroleum, which had begun operations in the East Indies in the late 1800s, rapidly adopted new technologies and pursued reforms – so that by 1892 it had integrated production, pipeline and refining operations.

​By the 1930s, when several IOCs discovered major deposits in the Middle East and North Africa, another stage in the industry’s transformation began to take place, with the eventual appearance of the ‘Seven Sisters’.

​The dominance of the ‘Seven Sisters’ coincided with the emergence of new movements around the world – particularly in producing countries like Algeria.

​As they implemented new reforms and more boldly asserted their sovereign rights, their cause was increasingly recognized. Important stakeholders even expressed their solidarity, with legendary Enrico Mattei, founder of ENI, publicly supporting the independence of Algeria, promoting strategic partnerships with newly emerging countries.

​Subsequent developments, the expansion of the industry and reforms in producing countries led to an assertion of their sovereign rights. The outcome was, of course, the 1960 founding of OPEC. The rest, as they say, is history.

​The history of oil abounds with similar examples of innovation and change, reforms and transformation. A key outcome of this trajectory was the establishment of the NOCs. Their evolution and growth has been truly remarkable.

​In the early days, NOCs were monolithic entities that necessarily had to juggle various roles – not just in commercial operations but also in the emergent policies and regulations overseeing the energy sector. These were heavy and rather conflicting mandates, but quite understandable in their formative ages.

​Over the years, however, as each Member Country and NOC pursued internal reforms, they were able to separate these three conflicting roles, allowing them to evolve into sophisticated, competitive corporations.

​Today NOCs are not only key players in their own domains but have ventured out abroad – going past their national borders and beyond their territories. Today they compete internationally with both IOCs and other NOCs – and have become successful INOCs.

​The history of Sonatrach – originally founded in 1963 and a proud co-organizer of this Summit – epitomizes such a transformation. With state ministries now handling energy policies, and authorities such as ALNAFT and ARH overseeing regulations, Sonatrach has been able to increasingly focus on its core mission – which is commercial operations.

​This has allowed it to grow into a successful INOC and become the largest oil company on the African Continent.

​A well-integrated oil and gas leader, Sonatrach’s extensive activities are well in accordance with the best of international practices. Its investment portfolio today includes upstream and downstream projects in Africa, Europe and Latin America.

​Already the third-largest gas supplier to EU, Sonatrach counts with three international export pipelines and two LNG terminals, as well as domestic shale exploration deals and a refinery in Italy.

​A product of a relentless reform-driven process of evolution and transformation, Sonatrach has wisely continued to pursue reforms in support of innovation and growth.

​Its recently announced “Project 2030” – or “SH2030” – sets out a long-term strategy, which envisions an expanded global role.

​Investments remain a priority. SH2030 is closely tied to attracting capital into the country, while achieving closer cooperation with IOCs. It also seeks to invest abroad, as one of the priorities of its vertical integration and diversification.

​One specific objective is creating $67 billion in additional revenue by 2030 (50% of which will be reinvested).

​This couldn’t come at a more opportune time, since countries like Algeria and the industry in general were impacted by the 2015-2016 contraction in investments.

​SH2030 thus comprises a ‘turning point’ for the company. It extends Sonatrach’s ongoing evolution into the future, and seeks to produce an efficient, flexible and robust organization for the benefit of Algeria, OPEC and the industry.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​It is clear that there is much to say about our country host, the ‘Pearl of Africa’, Algeria. But time is a precious resource, too, so I will conclude with a few final statements.

​Continuous reforms have driven the industry’s most important developments. They have kept companies ‘on course’, and ensured their growth and success.

​At the same time, ongoing changes have produced new relationships and priorities among Member Countries. The competitive relationship among the world’s oil producers have softened, and relationships between OPEC and some non-OPEC countries have become more collaborative and dialogue-driven.

​This has been well demonstrated at all levels – ministerial, corporate and academic – as seen recently at the OPEC International Seminar in June, in Vienna.

​There has also been a positive change in OPEC’s image and the way it is perceived. Amid increased focus and attention on OPEC, it is generally acknowledged that the face of the Organization has changed – and that it has taken distinct steps in the interest of the industry and the world economy.

​OPEC, in short, has become an indispensable ‘organ of stability’ in the oil market – continuously breaking new frontiers and establishing energy dialogues with the EU, Russia, China, India and the US.

​In this same spirit of openness, OPEC continues to share with all and sundry its data and reports, online, free of charge. Our annual World Oil Outlook (WOO), our Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) and our Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB) are all accessible through digital ‘apps’ – the first time in the industry!

​Increased collaboration and openness like this across all fronts seem to be the order of the day. Amid these and other changes, Algeria has continued to show us leadership and courage. This should be recognized – and it should be emulated and continued.

​May the spirit of the ‘Pearl of Africa’ – the land of the 1.5 million Heroic Martyrs, the land of Abdelaziz Bouteflika– continue to spur our industry and OPEC to greater heights!

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/114-29-october-2018.html"
"2018-10-17","​Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

​Namaskar!

​It is a great pleasure to return to New Delhi and participate in this Third High Level Meeting of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue.

​To my dear friend, His Excellency, the Honourable Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, and all of his team, you have demonstrated once more the world-renowned Indian hospitality and we are very grateful - bahoot dhanyavad!

​I am extremely fortunate, as this is my fourth mission to India since I assumed the position of OPEC Secretary General in August 2016. When I was here in April, I was delighted to visit the Digboi Refinery, Assam State, which represented the fulfilment of a lifetime wish.

​The uniqueness of this great nation’s culture, the immense contribution of Indian civilization in shaping our world, means that it is a profound honour for any visitor to enjoy this land.

​My only slight regret is that I could not stay to celebrate the great festival of Diwali here in a few weeks’ time! And although it is a little early, please permit me, on behalf of OPEC, to take the opportunity to wish all of you, your families and all your loved ones, a Happy Diwali and Saal Mubarak.

​In addition to my work-trips to this great land, the Honourable Minister and I meet regularly, in a range of other forums, which take place throughout the world. OPEC was honoured that the Minister addressed the 7th International OPEC Seminar on 21 June 2018 and enriched our event immeasurably through his insightful remarks.

​There are many factors which explain the frequency of these interactions between OPEC and India. It indicates the fact that as one very famous visitor to India put it, “It’s no exaggeration to say our Information Age is rooted in Indian innovations—including the number zero.” (Barack Obama) Furthermore, it reflects the initiative and visionary leadership of the Honourable Minister, who tirelessly works to ensure India positively influences international dialogue in the sphere of energy.

​However, most fundamentally of all, India is an extremely important partner for OPEC, and all of us in the Organization are determined to continue strengthening this relationship both at a technical and high-level.

​Since 2000, trade between India and OPEC has grown substantially. India’s overall imports from OPEC Member Countries increased from just over $4 billion to a high of above $170 billion in 2012, before dropping slightly in recent years. Total imports from OPEC Member Countries stood at $105 billion in 2017, up 25% year-on-year. And in the other direction, OPEC’s total imports from India increased from just under $4 billion in 2000 to over $60 billion in 2014. Moreover, OPEC Member Countries imports from India amounted to $44 billion in 2017.

​In terms of crude oil, India’s total imports have risen from around 1.5 mb/d in 2000 to close to 4.3 mb/d in 2017. And approximately 83% of this came from OPEC Member Countries. In fact, in 2017 India was the third fastest oil demand growing nation globally, with an increase of close to 140,000 b/d, or 3.3%.

​And this is not just a short or medium term trend. One of the central themes of OPEC’s flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook, the most recent version of which was launched in Algiers in September, also rolled-out yesterday in New Delhi, at the 2nd India Energy Forum, is the significant impact of India’s economic development on the energy industry.

​We estimate that India’s economy will grow at an average annual rate of 6.5% for the period 2017-2040.

​From the perspective of oil, demand growth will increasingly shift to India. By 2040, India’s oil demand is anticipated to increase by over 120%, from around 4.7 mb/d to 10.4 mb/d. Its total share of global oil demand will rise from almost 5%, to more than 9% by 2040.

​India is therefore projected to have the fastest average oil demand growth (3.7% p.a.) in the period 2017-2040, as well as the largest additional demand.

​To meet this increase in demand, both from India and elsewhere, the required global oil sector investment is estimated at $11 trillion. As I emphasized in my remarks at the India Energy Forum, this underscores the absolutely necessity of having a sustainable and stable oil market, conducive to encouraging the type of long-cycle investments necessary to meet future demand.

​This trajectory made the last downturn in our oil industry, from 2014-2016, particularly concerning. At a time when we needed a strong investment climate in the industry, instead we saw one trillion dollars in investments being frozen or discontinued. Exploration and production spending fell by an enormous 25% in both 2015 and 2016.

​Things needed to change, and as Mahatma Ghandi said, “be the change that you wish to see in the world.”

​This has led to what is termed the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process, whereby OPEC and its non-OPEC partners, work in a concerted manner to contribute to market stabilization efforts. The media tend to focus on the voluntary production adjustment component of this; however, there are a range of means by which the partners seek to work together in the interests of producers and consumers.

​The impact of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has exceeded all expectations. The partnership has evolved from a noble vision to a transformative force-for-good, a permanent feature of our energy landscape. The OECD commercial stock overhang above the five-year-average has been reduced by more than 370 mb, and switched to a deficit of around 32 mb in September 2018.

​Despite the progress achieved to date, there remain many non-fundamental factors which influence the global oil industry and are beyond the control of any one stakeholder. These include geopolitics, natural disasters and other critical uncertainties. This has been very apparent in recent months.

​Nevertheless, at the most recent meeting of the OPEC and non-OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), which met in Algiers, Algeria, on 23 September 2018, participating countries, while acknowledging growing uncertainties surrounding market fundamentals, including the economy, demand and supply, reaffirmed their focus on seeking a balanced and sustainably stable global oil market, serving the interests of consumers, producers, the industry and the global economy at large. The Committee also urged countries with spare capacity to work with customers to meet their demand during the remainder of 2018.

​Your Excellency, Ladies and gentlemen,

​Prime Minister Modi once said, “The power and energy sectors are the biggest constituents of the infrastructure sector. If you ignore them, no development will happen.”

​We share these views, for we believe that our industry can make a major contribution to sustainable development. We should not forget that today around 3 billion people worldwide do not have clean fuels for cooking, and around 1 billion people have no access to electricity. And we are very cognizant of India’s ongoing commitment to tackle the scourge of energy poverty.

​OPEC is committed to harnessing oil as a means of eradicating energy poverty in a sustainable manner. This can be achieved through collectively developing and adopting technologies, as well as all-inclusive energy policies, that transform the environmental credentials of all energies. This corresponds with the sub-target of Sustainable Development Goal 7 which aims “to enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including cleaner fossil-fuel technology.”

​Your Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

​As an intergovernmental organization, a collaborative approach to problem-solving and an emphasis on international dialogue on the basis of mutual respect are tenets integral to OPEC. It heartens us that India shares such commitment, for as Prime Minister Modi, so eloquently put it: “I believe mutual respect for one another and cooperation should be the basis for relationships with foreign nations.”

​The challenges we face today are different to what they were just two years ago. However, there is no substitute to international dialogue and working together as the most effective means of acting in the best interests of consumers, producers and the global economy.

​Once again, I thank you for endorsing, sustaining, enriching, and expanding this dialogue, as well as for your hospitality and Jai Hind!​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/115-17-october-2018.html"

​The theme of the Indian Energy Transition is very much bound with the global energy transition, underscoring how interconnected our energy future will be. It was India’s Noble Prize winning poet, Rabrindranath Tagore, the first non-European to win that distinguished prize, who foresaw a future,

​Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls.

​The interconnectivity of our world means that the only way we can overcome common challenges is through international cooperation and teamwork. This approach is integral to OPEC and is reflected in our Statute. It receives its modern manifestation in our collaboration with our Non-OPEC partners under the umbrella of the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation.’ And a collaborative approach, centered on the principles of mutual respect, transparency and knowledge-exchange forms the basis of the ever blossoming relationship between OPEC and India.

​Another defining characteristic of our energy future is that oil will continue to play a critical role in the energy mix. This is one of the foremost conclusions of OPEC’s recently launched World Oil Outlook (WOO) for 2018 on which topic there was a dedicated presentation at this forum by the OPEC Research Division yesterday, 15 October.

​One of the other key take-aways from this presentation was the pivotal importance that India will play in the future of the global oil industry and economic growth.

​We forecast that primary energy demand, globally, is expected to increase by 33%, or 91 mboe/d, between 2015 and 2040. A massive 24% of this anticipated increase will be from India, or 22 mboe/d.

​World oil demand is expected to increase by 14.5 mb/d, increasing from 97.2 mb/d in 2017 to 111.7 mb/d in 2040. India will account for oil demand growth of 5.8 mb/d, which represents an astonishing 40% of the overall increase.

​Therefore, the WOO concludes that India is projected to see the largest additional oil demand (3.7% per annum) and the fastest growth in the period to 2040.

​This impressive growth reflects the remarkable transformation of the Indian economy during the forecast period. We estimate that India’s economy will grow at an average annual rate of 6.5% for the period 2017-2040. Real GDP is expected to surpass OECD Europe by 2035, and by 2040, it is anticipated to even surpass OECD America.

​Now to meet the future needs of both India, and the world; in the period up to 2040, the required global oil sector investment is estimated at $11 trillion.

​Given these investment needs; consider how gravely worrying the situation was during the last market downturn, the most severe in the industry’s history. From 2014 to 2016, world oil supply growth outpaced that of oil demand, with world oil supply growing by 5.8 mb/d, while world oil demand increased by 4.3 mb/d.

​By July 2016, OECD commercial stock overhang reached a record high of about 403 mb over the five-year average. The OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016.

​Most ominously of all, investments were choked-off, with exploration and production spending falling by an enormous 25% in both 2015 and 2016. Additionally, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued, and many thousands of high quality jobs were lost. A record number of companies in our industry filed for bankruptcy.

​The multiplier effects of this contagion had the potential to wreak havoc on the future of the global economy, especially in developing countries. There can be no doubt about it, our industry was on the verge of catastrophe; a catastrophe that would have been devastating for producers and consumers.

​And when I consider this scenario, I am reminded of just how prescient the great statesman and father of this nation, Mahatma Ghandi, was when he said

​“the future depends on what you do today.”

​To safeguard a future which has the interests of consumers and producers at its core, decisive action was necessary. For as Rabindranath Tagore also said,

​“you can’t cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.”

​OPEC, in cooperation with a group of 10 other non-OPEC producers, held extensive consultations about the portentous situation in the latter half of 2016. These efforts eventually culminating in an historic decision in December 2016 of voluntary production adjustments under the name of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation,’ aimed at reintroducing stability to the market; stability essential for creating conditions conducive to attracting investment back to our industry.

​Since 2016, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has evolved from a noble vision to a transformative force-for-good, a permanent feature of the energy landscape – one that has had a profoundly positive impact on the global oil industry and beneficial multiplier effects for global economic growth.

​A long-absent element of stability has been reintroduced to the market, the rate of inventory drawdowns has been reversed and industry optimism and confidence abounds.

​The importance of the Declaration has also received backing from other producers, as well as from consumers. Without the collective efforts of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ strategic partners, the oil industry and the global economy would have easily slid into a major crisis.

​Throughout the entire ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ process, we have solicited the views of consumers, incorporating and responding to them within our strategy. The OPEC-India dialogue, the Third High Level Meeting of which will take place tomorrow, has been extremely important in this regard.

​While a broad and inclusive consultative process has yielded results; it continues to remain necessary because of current conditions in the global economy and in the oil industry.

​Non-fundamental factors, beyond the control of any individual stakeholder, can have a particularly strong influence on our industry. Geopolitical events, natural catastrophes, technological breakthroughs or other critical uncertainties, these can feed into the financial markets, thus amplifying their impacts on oil. This has been particularly apparent in recent months.

​OPEC’s recently published Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) acknowledged this in its most recent publication on 11 October. While global economic growth remains solid, it faces potential headwinds.

​Following a period of relatively synchronized growth, the economic growth trends between, and within, major regions are increasingly diverging. While growth in the major OECD economies remains well supported, decelerating trends have become visible in some emerging markets and developing countries (EMDCs).

​A combination of monetary tightening of the G4 central banks, weakening financial situations in some EMDCs, rising trade disputes and ongoing geopolitical challenges in some parts of the world are thus challenging the growth trend. Hence, OPEC’s global economic growth forecast for 2018 was revised down slightly by 0.1 percentage points to now stand at 3.7%, while the 2019 forecast remains unchanged at 3.6%.

​Other reporting agencies draw similar conclusions. The IMF, in advance of the recent 2018 Annual Meetings of the IMG and World Bank Group, 12-14 October in Bali, Indonesia, in a similar manner, downgraded its 2018 estimate for global growth to 3.7%, which although robust, is down from an earlier forecast of 3.9%. Furthermore, the IMF conclusion from its Annual Meetings noted that

​“policy uncertainty, historically high debt levels, rising financial vulnerabilities and limited policy could further undermine growth prospects.”

​Of course, a downward revision for global economic growth has serious repercussions for global oil demand. Consequently, OPEC has revised down its world oil demand growth forecast for 2018 and 2019. According to the October edition of the MOMR, world oil demand is projected to increase by 1.54 mb/d in 2018, a downward revision of around 80 tb/d from the previous month’s report. In 2019, world oil demand is anticipated to grow by 1.36 mb/d to average 100.15 mb/d, a downward revision of 50 tb/d from last month’s report.

​There have also been concerns expressed by consumers with regard to the outlook for supply, including from some of our friends in India.

​However, our current view is that the market is at the moment adequately supplied and well-balanced, though in a fragile state. For 2019, there is a growing potential for an imbalance, due to larger growth in supply. Naturally, this prognosis is subject to the critical uncertainties mentioned earlier.

​Our recent meeting of the OPEC and non-OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), which met in Algiers, Algeria, on 23 September 2018, explicitly acknowledged and addressed some of the concerns of consumers with regard to supply. I would like to quote from the meeting’s conclusions:

​The JMMC noted that, despite growing uncertainties surrounding market fundamentals, including the economy, demand and supply, the participating producing countries of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ continue to seek a balanced and sustainably stable global oil market, serving the interests of consumers, producers, the industry and the global economy at large.

​The Committee urged countries with spare capacity to work with customers to meet their demand during the remaining months of 2018.

​This underscores the commitment of OPEC Member Countries to accommodate anxiety over supply interruptions.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​In the midst of critical uncertainties, downside risks to the global economy and issues related to future demand, international cooperation and multilateralism are, quite simply, indispensable.

​For this reason, OPEC and its non-OPEC partners in the “Declaration of Cooperation,” continue to explore further means of institutionalizing our cooperation. In this spirit, I wholeheartedly endorse the sentiment and conclusions of World Bank Group President Jim Young Kim, when he recently said,

​“Challenges can turn into crisis if we don’t face them together. The strongest tool that we have to battle those challenges is the kind of solidarity that is embedded in multilateralism.”

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​It would be remiss of me to omit the climate change challenge from any discussion on the energy transition. This is particularly relevant given the launch on 8 October 2018 of an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways.

​Allow me to share some observations: the report indicates that there are multiple pathways to a 1.5°C warmer world; however, climate-related risks are unevenly distributed and the impact of 1.5°C global warming will disproportionately affect disadvantaged populations, especially in the Developing World.

​Given the scale of this challenge to eliminate 42 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in annual emissions, a collective and comprehensive response is not only essential, but urgently needed. The key word here is emissions. We cannot afford to disregard the positive contributions of any one energy source or industry. We in OPEC are unwavering believers that the global oil industry has a critical role to play in meeting the challenge. For our industry, we need to recognize that the environmental challenge is not oil and gas in-and-of themselves. It is the emissions that come from burning them.

​This is not about choosing one energy source over another. It has been suggested in some quarters that renewables are our only energy future. Not only is this line of thinking misguided, it overlooks the critical role the oil industry can play in being part of the solution.

​And I believe that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions.

​OPEC remains fully engaged with and supportive of the Paris Agreement. We firmly believe that a global consensus from the multilateral process remains the best and most inclusive way for all nations to collectively counter climate change in a fair and equitable manner.

​Alongside this challenge, energy poverty, as the IPCC report acknowledges, remains a scourge of our age. Today around 3 billion do not have clean fuels for cooking, and approximately 1 billion have no access to electricity. The link between climate change and sustainable development appears to be rather complex; and the IPCC report concludes that maximising synergies and limiting trade-offs should be the goal when planning future actions to reduce climate change and pursuing sustainable development promoting equitable societies.

​Reducing the development and climate policy implementation gap depends on an enabling international governance and financial architecture that allows access to finance and technology and helps address trade barriers.

​It is important to recognize that in order to reach such a temperature target, it is important to ensure a Party-driven process, recall different national circumstances; evoke the principles of equity and of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities; balance mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation; and take into account the overriding priority of sustainable development.

​With regard to the energy transition, it should be stressed that it is vital to use energy efficiently and constantly develop and adopt cleaner energy technologies, such as Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage. Coordinated action should also be enhanced, supporting research and development, innovation and technology transfer; while providing sufficient financial support.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Another Indian Noble Prize winner, Kailash Satyarthi, once said,

​India is a place for a billion solutions.

​Given the rapid development of this great nation, and the great potential of its young people, we will all surely agree with this statement. May this wonderful country; a land of ceaseless innovation, cultural diversity, and boundless ingenuity, inspire us all to continue to work together in the interests of consumers and producers.

​Once again, I thank you for your hospitality and Jai Hind!​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/116-16-october-2018.html"
"2018-10-11","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, ladies & gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is always a pleasure to be back in London; a place I call my second home. And it is always gratifying to be back at the Oil & Money conference; an annual event that all of us in the industry strive to attend.

​I would like to thank the Chair of this session, Herman Franssen, for his generous introduction, as well as the organizers, Energy Intelligence and the New York Times, for the invitation to the 39th edition of this premier industry conference.

​I would also like to take this opportunity to offer my congratulations to this year’s Energy Intelligence Petroleum Executive of the Year Award, Bob Dudley, Chief Executive Officer of BP.

​Bob is a true gentleman, but with a steely resolve that has enabled BP to recover from the challenges it faced at the beginning of this decade. He has led the company’s recovery, rebuilt its reputation and returned it to growth. He has also been proactive in seeking solution to improve the environmental credentials of oil, and has been a supportive voice in OPEC’s market stability efforts.

​There is no-one more deserving of this prestigious award from his industry peers.

​Ladies & gentlemen,

​When I was speaking at this conference last year we were just over nine months into the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. It was a time when the market and the industry were starting to emerge out of the shadows of the three-year downturn that had impacted the entire industry.

​It has been evident over the past year that we are now seeing a brighter path ahead. The cooperative efforts of the 25 producers in the ‘Declaration’ have helped accelerate the return of balance to the global oil market, restore much needed stability and confidence to the industry, and it has had a positive effect on the global economy and trade worldwide.

​The ‘Declaration’ has had a transformational impact on the global oil industry. The change we have seen over the past 20 months is like night and day.

​However, we are not resting on this success. Our full focus remains on building what has been achieved by sustaining a healthy and stable global oil market, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​Only last week in Moscow at Russia Energy Week, I heard from His Excellency Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation; HE Alexander Novak, Oil Minister of the Russian Federation; and HE Khalid A. Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, about the additional oil that has been added to the market since June to maintain the supply and demand balance.

​We also heard from HE Al-Falih that Saudi Arabia has not turned down a single customer.

​Additionally, we have also seen OECD inventories build over the past two months.

​This all emphasizes that the market is well-balanced and well-supplied.

​Moreover, through the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and the Joint Technical Committee of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ it is also well-monitored.

​Nonetheless, we do recognize that there are many non-fundamental factors influencing the market that are beyond the oil industry’s control, such as geopolitics, growing trade disputes, natural disasters and other developments. They can have compound effects and are a major source of uncertainties.

​The goal of sustaining the stability is also a reason why we continue to explore means of institutionalizing the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, as was discussed most recently in Algiers during the 10th JMMC meeting.

​The importance of this sustainable stability is evident across all timeframes. It is vital to tackle the challenges we face today, on both the supply and demand side, and it will be vital to the industry’s medium- and long-term future.

​This is evident in OPEC’s recently released World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2018, which aims to bridge the linkages between the various timeframes.

​The WOO 2018 underscores that the world will need more energy in the decades to come, as economies expand, populations grow, and given the fact today around three billion people lack access to clean fuels and efficient technologies for cooking, and almost one billion are still without access to electricity.

​In our Outlook, global energy demand increases by a healthy 33% between 2015 and 2040.

​Energy is a central facet that links our daily lives; it is not on call, it cannot take a holiday, it cannot call in sick. Energy is a 24-hour service. Thus, it needs to be reliable, consistent and sustainable, and as I have already mentioned, it needs to be accessible to each and every one of us.

​Alongside the challenge of meeting growing energy demand is the need to constantly improve the environmental footprint of the energies we use.

​In this regard, let me stress that OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, which remains the only viable global framework to address climate change.

​This all leads me to ask the question: how can this growth be achieved in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment?

​What is emphasized in our Outlook is that the future requires all energies; it is not about choosing one over another.

​In some quarters, we hear stories that suggest renewables are our only energy future. This is clearly misguided.

​Renewables are evidently coming of age, with wind and solar, expanding fast, and others such as hydropower and biomass, maintaining their shares in the energy mix out to 2040. However, even by 2040, they are estimated to make up only around 19% of the global energy mix.

​Let me stress that many OPEC Member Countries have great sources of solar and wind, and significant investments are being made in these fields.

​With the share for nuclear expected to be at just over 6% by 2040, it means that the world will need to look elsewhere for around three-quarters of its energy needs by 2040.

​In terms of oil and gas, there is no doubt that they will remain central to supplying an expanding global population with the critical energy it needs.

​In our Outlook, oil has an expected share of around 28% in the global energy mix, and gas is at 25%, by 2040.

​Even in the most optimistic of outlooks I have seen for renewables, I have not observed one predicting that they will come close to surpassing oil and gas in the decades ahead.

​Oil will remain a fuel of choice for the foreseeable future.

​We see oil demand increasing by around 14.5 million barrels a day (mb/d) between now and 2040 to reach close to 112 mb/d. Moreover, this is the second consecutive year we have raised our oil demand number for 2040.

​There are a number of voices who see oil demand being significantly impacted by the electrification of the road transportation sector.

​There is no doubt that electric vehicles are making inroads into the sector, but not to the extent that some would have us believe.

​This is clear in the numbers. Electric vehicles made up well below 1% of the total vehicle fleet in 2017. While their expansion is impressive in the years ahead, reaching a level of around 13% in 2040, supported by falling battery costs and policy support, it is conventional vehicles, including hybrids, that are still expected to make up 82% of the vehicle fleet by 2040.

​There are possible upsides for electric vehicles, and other alternative fuel vehicles, which we highlight in the Outlook.

​However, we should also emphasize that there are possibilities to improve the efficiencies of conventional engines and the fuels they use. In fact, it should be noted that fuel efficiency improvements are expected to result in a far greater reduction in oil demand, than the increasing penetration of alternative fuel vehicles in the period to 2040.

​The clear message is that conventional vehicles will remain the mainstay of the road transportation sector.

​Given our Outlook, as well as many others carrying similar forecasts, it is also important to broach the issues of policies and technologies.

​In this regard, we need to continually look to develop, evolve and adopt cleaner energy technologies, as well as all-inclusive and non-discriminatory energy policies, that enable us to meet expected future energy demand, in a sustainable and ever more efficient manner.

​As my friend Bob Dudley aptly said at this conference last year: “This shouldn’t be about a race to renewables alone; it’s about a race to lower greenhouse gas emissions.”

​For oil and gas, we need to recognize that the environmental challenge is not oil and gas themselves. It is the emissions that come from burning them.

​I am a believer that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions.

​I welcome coordinated action within the industry and through various research and development platforms, such as the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative, which continues to expand as a group and implement bold actions.

​On the policy front, it is important to stress that if our industry is worried about policies that detrimentally impact oil, with talk of stranded assets and declining values of oil; then we have a potentially dangerous scenario, one that could increase volatility significantly.

​This is not in the interests of either producers or consumers.

​This is brought home by the scale of the investment requirements. Oil-related investments across the upstream, midstream and downstream are estimated at around $11 trillion in the period to 2040.

​The basic foundation for investment and growth can only come through balance and stability in the market.

​In this regard, OPEC Member Countries remain fully committed to investments across the whole industry value chain, and the issue of returning global investments is a core focus of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​Ladies & gentlemen,

​My final point and one that links everything I have said today relates to ‘cooperation’.

​As OPEC, as the countries in the ‘Declaration’, and as an industry, we need to tell our story over and over again.

​We need to work together to bring reasoned thinking, and realistic ambitions to our global energy future.

​Over the years OPEC has pushed many forms of energy cooperation, including both producers and consumers, and we stand willing and ready to dialogue with all industry stakeholders.

​We always look to build bridges, not walls.

​It was the legendary Englishman Charles Darwin, who said: “In the long history of humankind those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.”

​While the times we live in often appear turbulent and challenges daunting, experience has repeatedly shown us that the enduring principle of cooperation and the bravery to try something new, such as the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, can bring about great success.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/117-11-october-2018.html"
"2018-09-25","Ladies & gentlemen,
Buenos días

[SLIDE 1]
It is a great pleasure to have been asked to speak to you today.

In this regard, I would like to personally thank Mr. Iñigo Diaz de Espada, the Chairman of the Spanish Committee of the World Energy Council and the Chair of this session. OPEC has always been a strong and positive supporter of the World Energy Council, and I am extremely honoured to be speaking here to such a distinguished gathering.

I also fondly recall that one of my first speaking engagements as OPEC Secretary General was at the 23rd World Energy Congress in Istanbul in October 2016.

I would also like to offer thanks to my great friend, HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, the Minister of Energy & Industry of the United Arab Emirates – where the 24th World Energy Congress will take place – and the President of the OPEC Conference. He was a key initiator behind my participation today.

Suhail has also been a skillful advocate for OPEC during his tenure as OPEC President, helping push the Organization’s objectives at events such as this one, as well as through the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between 25 OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

[SLIDE 2 - Disclaimer]

[SLIDE 3]
The ‘Declaration’ has focused on restoring a sustainable stability to the industry through what I might term ‘innovative and ground breaking cooperation’. And let me stress that the impact of this cooperation has exceeded even the most optimistic projections.

The cooperative efforts have helped accelerate the return of balance to the global oil market, return much needed optimism to the industry, with investments now gradually picking up, and it has had a positive effect on the global economy and trade worldwide.

Moreover, it has also led to a significant change in industry-wide and public perceptions of OPEC. The Organization has ably demonstrated its credentials as a body committed to international cooperation, and honouring its commitments and promoting mutual respect among all nations.

The ‘Declaration’ is now a permanent feature of the global energy scene, establishing a novel framework for producing countries, whilst also taking into account the vital interests of consumer countries, as well as the global economy.

The importance of these recent developments, specifically in terms of helping achieve market stability, and just as importantly, sustaining it, is clearly vital across all timeframes. While the focus for many is obviously on the short-term, we need to recall that the short- , medium- and long-terms are all interlinked. We cannot view any of them in isolation.

[SLIDE 4]
This is the focus of OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO), with the 2018 edition very much ‘hot off the press’ after being launched only two days ago in Algiers, at an event to mark the secondary anniversary of the seminal Algiers meeting that set us on the path that eventually led to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ in December 2016.

The Outlook aims to bridge the linkages between the various timeframes to enable the Organization to share its views and analysis of global oil and energy markets.

Ladies and gentlemen,

It was the great Spanish artist, Salvador Dali, who said:

“He who wants to interest others must provoke them.”

It is with this thought that I am here today, as I present the findings of our 2018 Outlook as a means to stimulate discussions, stir debate and hopefully foster knowledge-sharing.

I think we all appreciate that the future is one laden with challenges and uncertainties, but also many opportunities. There will no doubt be areas where we may all agree, as well as areas where there will be divergences.

I very much welcome your feedback, and your questions. Please feel free to provoke me!

[SLIDE 5]
The theme of today’s event relates to energy futures and energy transitions.

It is evidently an extremely timely and relevant theme given that there is currently much talk of the ‘energy transition’. In this regard, it is important to ask the question: what does this actually mean for the energy mix, and for people around the world?

Today, we hear media reports of a future world of only renewables, where electrification will come to dominate the transportation sector, and where fossil fuels are set to be consigned to history.

All of these statements offer an extremely misleading view. It is important that we all look beyond the headlines, and bring some analysis and perspective to our energy future.

What is clear is that the world will need more energy in the decades to come. It is easy to appreciate why.

In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook, the size of the global economy in 2040 is estimated to be more than 200% that of 2017. And over the same timeframe, global population is projected to reach around 9.2 billion, an increase of over 1.6 billion from today’s level.

We should also not forget that today around three billion people lack access to clean fuels and efficient technologies for cooking, and almost one billion are still without access to electricity. It is vital that this is addressed.

Energy access is not a luxury; it has to be seen as a necessity. There is huge potential for socio-economic development in terms of expanding access to modern energy services.

[SLIDE 6]
We expect global energy demand to increase by a robust 33% between 2015 and 2040, which is driven predominantly by developing countries, which see almost 95% of the overall growth.

Energy will be required to power more homes, more services, more businesses, more cars, more planes, more ships, more technologies … I could go on.

At the same time, however, we need to recognize the threat posed by climate change to our environment. Let me stress here that OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement.

We firmly believe that a global consensus from the multilateral process remains the best and most inclusive way for all nations to collectively mitigate or adapt to the impacts of climate change based on the core principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ in a fair and equitable manner.

Thus, our 2018 Outlook underscores that OPEC is fully aware of the dual challenge of meeting growing energy demand, while constantly improving the environmental footprint of all the energies we use.

To put it simply, the basic energy challenge can be summed up in two questions.

The first is how can we ensure there is enough supply to meet expected future demand growth?

And the second is how can this growth be achieved in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment?

[SLIDE 7]
What the Outlook emphasizes is that all energies are required. It is not about choosing one energy source over another.

In fact, the Reference Case for this year’s Outlook sees all energy sources expanding over the entire forecast period, except coal that peaks around 2030.

Nonetheless, it is vital we appreciate just what each energy source provides today, and what they can provide in the decades ahead.

There is no doubt that renewables, such as solar and wind, will continue to significantly expand their role. They are expected to have the highest average growth rate of around 7.4% per annum over the period to 2040, although it is important to remember their current low base.

OPEC Member Countries recognize and support the development of renewables. Many of our countries have great sources of solar and wind, and significant investments are being made in these fields.

Nuclear is also expected to witness some expansion in its share of the global energy mix, and biomass and hydropower are forecast to maintain their shares in the years ahead.

Overall, these renewable energies and nuclear are expected to increase their share in the energy mix from around 18% in 2015 to about 25% by 2040.

The upshot of this is that all of the three current main primary sources of energy – oil, gas and coal – are still anticipated to supply about three-quarters of the energy mix by 2040. Oil is expected at around 28%, with gas at 25%, and coal at just over 22%.

From the perspective of oil and gas, it underscores the fact that they will remain central to supplying the growing global population with the critical energy it needs in the decades ahead.

Of course, you may say to me, well you would say this – you are the OPEC Secretary General. But I am also a realist. I do not see any outlook predicting that other energies will come close to overtaking oil and gas in the decades ahead.

[SLIDE 8]
In terms of oil, specifically, I think the key message from our Outlook is that there is no doubt that oil will remain a fuel of choice for the foreseeable future.

We see oil demand increasing by around 14.5 million barrels a day between now and 2040 to reach close to 112 million barrels a day. Moreover, this is the second consecutive year we have raised our oil demand numbers for 2040.

[SLIDE 9]
I would also like to dig a little deeper into oil demand in our Outlook to look at some of the sectors driving this growth, as well as highlight the potential impact of electric vehicles.

In terms of sectors, transportation remains the major incremental demand driver to 2040, with expectations for an increase of more than 8 mb/d, mostly in the road transportation sector, which sees growth of 4.1 million barrels a day.

As you would expect, this demand growth is driven by the expected increase in the total vehicle fleet for passenger and commercial vehicles. This is projected to increase by over 1.1 billion vehicles to hit close to 2.4 billion in 2040.

Here, it is important to underscore that the majority of the growth continues to be for conventional vehicles. Nonetheless, the Outlook does see the long-term share of electric vehicles in the total fleet expanding and reaching a level of around 13% in 2040, supported by falling battery costs and policy support. For all alternative fuel vehicles, the figure is 18%.

While this is certainly an impressive expansion for electric vehicles, given that levels were well below 1% in 2017, it does need to be placed in the context that conventional vehicles, including hybrids, are still expected to make up 82% of the vehicle fleet by 2040.

While there are various sensitivities that could shift these numbers, both upward and downwards, there is a message to be derived from this.

Conventional vehicles will remain the mainstay of the road transportation sector, and I should add there are clearly possibilities to further improve the efficiencies of these engines and the fuels they use.

It is also important to note the expected oil demand growth in the petrochemicals sector, which for the first World Oil Outlook sees more growth than in the road transportation sector over the forecast period to 2040.

Global demand in this sector is estimated to expand by 4.5 million barrels a day by 2040. The largest increase is projected for developing countries, most notably Asian countries and OPEC Member Countries, driven by demand for petrochemical products and the availability of feedstock in these regions.

[SLIDE 10]
On the supply side, non-OPEC is set to increase supply by more than 9 mb/d between 2017 and 2027, with the major driver being US tight oil, but there are also significant additions from Canada, Brazil and Kazakhstan.

In fact, global tight oil supply is set to grow to over 15 million barrels a day by the second half of the 2020s, thus making up almost a quarter share of non-OPEC supply at its peak.

Beyond this period, however, non-OPEC supply is set to decline by around 4 mb/d, chiefly due to losses in US tight oil production, as well as depletion in other regions, such as the Asia-Pacific, North Sea and Latin America.

[SLIDE 11]
It means that in the long-term, the demand for OPEC crude is projected to increase to around 40 mb/d in 2040, up from 32 mb/d in 2018.

The share of OPEC crude in the global oil supply is estimated to increase from 34% in 2017 to 36% in 2040.

[SLIDE 12]
To meet the expected global expansion will require huge investments. We also need to consider that new barrels are needed not only to increase production, but to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. Oil-related investment requirements across the upstream, midstream and downstream are estimated at around $11 trillion in the period to 2040.

On a positive note, we have seen investment picking up again this year, after the significant downturns witnessed in 2015 and 2016. However, we need to remain watchful and vigilant to ensure the necessary future investments are made.

It is important to remember that the foundation for investment and growth can only come through balance and stability in the market. It is always worth recalling that long-term security of supply is intrinsically linked to short-term conditions.

In this regard, OPEC Member Countries remain fully committed to investments across the whole industry value chain, and the issue of returning global investments is a core focus of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

[SLIDE 13]
When thinking about our energy future, particularly when viewing it from the industrialized world, we need to remember how important oil and gas have been to their past. They have transformed their economies and their societies. They have provided heat, light and mobility. They have created and sustained economic growth and prosperity.

However, we should not forget that this has not been the story for everyone.

When we start up our cars, switch on our modern cookers, turn on a light, we need to recognize that these everyday things are still unknown to billions of people across the world who continue to suffer from energy poverty.

These are people that need their voices heard. They need access to reliable, safe and secure modern energy services at scale.

Of course, the economics of wanting more, coupled with growing populations and rising energy demand, has created challenges that were not foreseen when Thomas Edison was developing the light bulb, or when Henry Ford was mass producing the car.

I am talking here about the environmental challenge. In this regard, we need to recognize that the issue is not oil and gas themselves. The challenge is the emissions that come from burning them.

It is a challenge we need to face head on. And I believe it is a challenge that can be overcome. Given what I have already said, it would be wrong of us to dismiss oil and gas as part of the past. I am a believer that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions.

We need to continually look to develop, evolve and adopt cleaner energy technologies, as well as all-inclusive and non- discriminatory energy policies, that enable us to meet the expected future energy demand, in a sustainable manner.

[SLIDE 14]
One word I have uttered on many occasions over the past two years is central to all this. That word is ‘cooperation’.

The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has shown what can be achieved through collaboration in challenging times. It helped turn the tide of the oil market, and we now see calmer waters.

However, this kind of cooperation needs to be undertaken not only in times of instability, but also when the market is stable and balanced. Dialogue is vital at all times.

Over the years OPEC has pushed many forms of energy cooperation, including dialogues with the European Union, Russia China and India, symposia and workshops with the IEF and the IEA, various initiatives with the G20, and meetings with other industry stakeholders.

In this regard, we look forward to meeting the European Commissioner for Energy, Miguel Arias Cañete, and his team later this year through the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue, to discuss a variety of issues, including the future energy mix, policies and technologies.

Of course, I cannot stand here and say dialogue will mean we find agreement on everything. We do not live in a perfect world. But it is important for all stakeholders to look for shared and realistic solutions, where and when appropriate.

[SLIDE 15]
Ladies and gentlemen,

In terms of talk of an ‘energy transition’, I think it is important to leave you with a few key messages:

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/118-25-september-2018.html"
"2018-09-23","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​It is a pleasure to add my words of welcome to the 10th meeting of the JMMC.

​I’d like to add my thanks and appreciation to our Algerian hosts, to His Excellency, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika; HE Mustapha Guitouni, Minister of Energy; and all our Algerian colleagues who have extended such outstanding hospitality to us. Arrangements for these meetings have been exceptional and it has been a great honour to enjoy this wonderful country over the last few days.

​It is indeed of great significance to return to Algiers after our critically important Conference two years ago. Algeria has played a very unique role since joining OPEC in 1969 and it is only proper that we use this opportunity to celebrate the contribution Algeria has made to the betterment of our Organization.

​Algiers was the location of the First OPEC Summit in 1975 and resulted in the Organization’s First Solemn Declaration. The Summit also resulted in the founding of the OPEC Fund for International Development, (OFID). Algeria also hosted meetings of the OPEC Conference in 1980, 2004, 2008 and 2016. Therefore, it is very appropriate that we honour Algeria’s role at this commemorative meeting of the JMMC.

​I’d like to commend the hard work of the chairman and co-chairman of this committee, HE Khalid A. Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. The outstanding leadership they have demonstrated has guided the JMMC to achieve truly remarkable results.

​Additionally, I’d like to thank the OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, and all of the Secretariat staff for the thorough preparation for our meetings this week.

​I’d also like to commend the JTC for producing such a high quality report for our review.

​Today, our industry is in a much healthier place than when the historic Algiers Meeting took place on 28 September 2016. Fundamentals are strong and we have seen a return of a greater degree of balance to the market. OPEC and its non-OPEC partners have demonstrated what can be achieved when working together. I’d like to commend all participating countries for their historic efforts in this regard.

​There is no doubt that this committee has played an important role in contributing to our many successes. Proper monitoring of conditions in the oil market is an essential component of transparent and effective work. The JMMC continues to fulfil its mandate commendably.

​Despite our major achievements towards market stability, we face new uncertainties today. Many of these uncertainties are factors beyond our control; nevertheless, they need to be continuously monitored in order to build on the progress made to date.

​In this regard, I hope we can continue our important discussions on further means of institutionalising our cooperation. We are only seeing the beginning of all the great things we can accomplish when working together, in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy.

​So let me conclude by once again, thanking our gracious Algerian hosts and wishing us all fruitful discussions.

​Thank you for your kind attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/119-23-september-2018.html"
"2018-09-23","Introduction and Salutations

Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: good morning. I want to welcome you all to the JMMC meeting, as we review the findings and analyses of our Joint Technical Committee, deliberate on current market conditions, assess their future direction, and strengthen our continued collaboration that is so important to oil market stability.

On behalf of everyone here, I would like to express our appreciation to the state of Algeria under the leadership of His Excellency the Honorable Abdulaziz Bouteflika, as well as to the entire Algerian organizing team led by the Algerian Minister of Energy HE Mustapha Guitouni, for their gracious hospitality and warm welcome to this historic city, and for their diligent efforts in hosting our gathering. I think I speak for everyone when I say that last night was one to remember for the fantastic dinner and folklore show we have all enjoyed.

OPEC and non-OPEC have continued to work well together

Despite a complex and challenging environment over the past several months, which has been shaped by the confluence of a wide range of market and non-market factors, I’m delighted that our partnership of OPEC and non-OPEC producers continues to work well and to produce admirable results. I am also pleased to note that both the JMMC and the JTC have made outstanding efforts in demanding circumstances.

I would like to thank both the Joint Technical Committee and every one of my JMMC colleagues for their cooperation and to congratulate them on the favorable results that have been achieved.

I would also like to express a special note of appreciation to HE Suhail Al Mazrouei, the UAE Minister of Energy & Industry and President of the OPEC Conference, HE Alexander Novak, the Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, and HE Mohammad Barkindo, Secretary General of OPEC, for their personal contributions to these successes.

Current market situation is satisfactory

My friends, as we all are acutely aware, oil market stability is critically important to the health of the entire global economy and particularly the prosperity of developing nations whose economies require an ever increasing amount of energy for their growth and prosperity. So, we fully recognize that oil should act as a lubricant that helps to propel and accelerate economies, and not as a headwind which slows them.

Ladies and gentlemen, I’m delighted to note that our joint efforts have played such a pivotal role in achieving the current level of market stability despite the wide ranging challenges that the market had to endure.

Also in my view, the high degree of reassurance that our efforts provided to consuming countries during times of market uncertainty have been equally important, and served everyone well. In hindsight it is clear that our decision to ease supplies was the right one taken at the right moment, although there were some who questioned that decision at the time.

With this scene set, I want to briefly review the key fundamental aspects underpinning the market stability. In the interest of time, let’s quickly look at each of them.

And when it comes to the functioning of our joint efforts, the OPEC and Non-OPEC cooperation has remained strong, which has without a doubt played a key role in creating market stability.

Complex upcoming situation anticipated

Of course, while the current situation is satisfactory, the global economy and oil markets are rather fragile, and we cannot afford to slip into complacency, especially in light of the complexities and challenges that appear on the horizon. This involves geopolitical, macro-economic, as well as oil supply and demand uncertainties.

So, in light of these intricacies, what would be a logical strategy looking toward the future?

Clearly and simply, it is critical that we continue to foresee and anticipate changing market supply and demand balances and take proactive actions to avoid conditions that could make consumers uneasy and anxious.

In particular, that means availing adequate supplies and avoiding any shortfalls in the market. Uncertainty and anxiety not only erode oil demand but also undermine the broader market environment, which could easily tip into instability on either side of the supply-demand equation.

Continued deliberations with consumers are also important

In addition to our current JMMC framework, I strongly believe that continued candid dialogue with consumers is also an important part of our joint strategy going forward. Such engagement not only provides us with an opportunity to better understand the viewpoints of our consumers, but also to inspire greater confidence among them and create the conditions to sustain a more stable market.

Importance of continued OPEC/non-OPEC cooperation

Looking further into the future, as previously indicated we continue to work on creating suitable longer term mechanisms for cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, which will ensure that the market is well-monitored, well-supplied, and well-balanced, as well as injecting confidence into it.

Last, but not least, as we approach the end of this year, we must start working on our plans for collective action to keep the market balanced in 2019. I believe we must use the remaining time before the Ministerial Meetings in December to prepare proposals for 2019 production.

Concluding Remarks

In summary, ladies and gentlemen, we can take a good deal of satisfaction from the current oil market situation which in large part is the result of sustained cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. While a more challenging environment is anticipated on the road ahead, and some volatility seems to be returning to the market, I remain confident in our joint ability to provide sufficient supplies in the short-term and maintain market stability in the mid-term by acting in a measured, deliberate and timely manner.

For the long-term our proposed new framework for OPEC and Non-OPEC cooperation will provide assurance that markets will remain under stewardship.

Because market conditions are a function of factors related to both supply and demand, though, I want to stress that the economic wellbeing of consumers will remain a key priority of ours, especially when it comes to more fragile developing economies. And in order to develop and deliver on a longer-term strategy for sustained market stability, I expect our cooperation with non-OPEC producers to continue well beyond this year.

Again, I thank each of you for your efforts to help achieve the positive market conditions we see today, and for your continued cooperation and constructive engagement in the future. I also reiterate my gratitude to our hosts for their gracious hospitality. Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/120-23-september-2018.html"
"2018-09-23","​HE Khalid Al-Falih, Chairman of the JMMC,
​HE Alexander Novak, Co-chairman,
​HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, President of the OPEC Conference,
​HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, Secretary General of OPEC,
​Excellencies,
​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Allow me to warmly welcome you to Algeria, in this wonderful city of Algiers - known as Almahroussa The Well Kept - which, during its two and a half millennia of history, has left none of its visitors indifferent to its magnificent bay, its streets and districts steeped in history, the whiteness of its buildings and the charm of its inhabitants.

​In line with its traditions and history, Algeria has never ceased to work towards the rapprochement of positions between countries that are brothers and friends. Just after we have completed the nationalization of its hydrocarbon resources, Algeria held in 1975, not far from here, the First Summit of Sovereigns and Heads of State of OPEC, resulting in the First Solemn Declaration of Algiers. Subsequently, many meetings of the OPEC Conference were successfully held, from Algiers to Oran, until our today’s meeting of the OPEC & non-OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee.

​It is all the more pleasant for me to welcome you back to Algiers as we celebrate the second anniversary of the Historic Algiers Accord on September 28, 2016, which laid the foundations of the OPEC Non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation, adopted by 25 countries.

​Even though in the early months of its implementation, unjustified doubts weighed on our collective ability to act effectively to eliminate the excess of stocks and restore oil market balance, we have all shown leadership, flexibility and good governance.

​The work of the JMMC and its technical body, the JTC, are the expression of this good governance which gives the oil market a necessary visibility and more transparency.

​The Declaration of Cooperation is a remarkable historical success. It is, today, in the interest of producers, the oil industry and consumers to capitalize on its positive effects and ensure a smooth transition so as not to destabilize the ongoing return to market equilibrium.

​We must now consider the ways and means of sustaining our cooperation and maintaining the basis for a permanent dialogue not only between OPEC and non-OPEC countries, but also, and above all, between producing and consuming countries.

​Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,

​I renew my warmest welcome to all in Algiers, The Well Kept, and wish all the success to our work.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/121-23-september-2018.html"
"2018-09-23","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​Allow me to lend my voice to these wise reflections of the Honourable Ministers and add a just few brief remarks of my own.

​It is a distinct pleasure to be back here in Algeria, the Pearl of Africa, and in this extraordinary capital city of Algiers, to commemorate the 2nd Anniversary of the landmark Algiers Accord.

​Being back here in this magnificent city brings back so many memories of our extensive efforts in 2016 to restore stability in the global oil market that had rapidly sunk into a deep decline. Indeed, the industry had not seen such a downward spiral in decades.

​Thanks to these courageous efforts and an unprecedented cooperation that transcended borders, there will be a chapter in the history books of this industry that will have a title such as: “The Algiers Accord—the turning point towards a new era of cooperation in the international oil industry.”

​May I also request that you pause for a moment and reflect on the additional reasons for which we are here. Yesterday, we held the 20th Meeting of the JTC, a key milestone. Today we are holding the 10th Meeting of the JMMC, a major milestone, and let us not forget the 10th anniversary of our Conference in Oran, where OPEC proactively rose to the grave challenges presented by the global financial crisis. Algeria, and indeed Algiers, has become the “city of turning points” for our industry.

​And indeed, this afternoon, we will have the pleasure of commemorating these defining moments in our industry. What better place for this to occur than here in Algiers, where it all started in 2016.

​We also look forward to paying a much-deserved special tribute to His Excellency, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, looking back at the influential role he has played as a key leader in our industry for decades, with the latest of these achievements being that of the Declaration of Cooperation.

​Mr. Chairman, excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​As part of our quest as a centre of excellence, we continue to promote information exchange and open dialogue regarding oil market developments and analysis.

​This afternoon, we will officially launch the 2018 version of the World Oil Outlook, which is the 12th edition of this flagship publication, and I invite all of you to attend this special occasion.

​It is gratifying to note that, over the years, our World Oil Outlook has come to be valued as one of the most sought-after reference materials for policymakers, corporate decision makers, analysts, the media and the general public.

​Transparency of data is and always has been of utmost importance for OPEC. In this regard, mobile Apps are now available for the World Oil Outlook, the Annual Statistical Bulletin and the Monthly Oil Market Report, providing access to a vast amount of oil market data from 1960 to the present online and free of charge to all.

​I might add here that this transparency extends to everything we do as an Organization. As such, it should be evident that OPEC is neither a monopoly, nor a cartel, but a responsible global platform that consistently strives to maintain stability in the oil markets, in the interests of both producers and consumers. We have a vested, mutual interest in the healthy growth of the global economy.

​In conclusion, this OPEC-Non-OPEC cooperation will continue to enhance dialogue and build bridges across the industry. It will work hard to ensure a sustainable stability in the global oil market, enabling steady and lasting economic growth across consuming and producing countries.

​From the beginning, OPEC Member Countries have endeavoured to meet their customers’ needs in a reliable and secure manner. We continue to have open and inclusive dialogue with all major stakeholders, including consumers, in an effort to consider common issues of concern regarding market stability. And this feedback, naturally, factors into any decision taken by OPEC, and more recently, by our Non-OPEC friends as well.

​Thank you for your kind attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/122-23-september-2018.html"
"2018-09-05","​Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​We are deeply honoured and humbled to receive this prestigious Award. We would like to thank Africa Oil and Power, the Advisory Board and everyone involved for bestowing such a prestigious accolade.

​We consider ourselves fortunate just to attend this inaugural Africa Oil and Power Energy Coalitions Dinner and be amongst such an elite audience of state leaders, energy ministers, and oil and gas industry peers.

​We interpret this Award as recognition of the teamwork, dedication and selflessness of a remarkable group of countries: namely, the “Declaration of Cooperation” strategic partners. Working with the statesmen, leaders and representatives of the OPEC Member Countries and the non-OPEC producing countries has been the honour of lifetime. Thankfully, our tireless efforts have borne fruit and our industry is in a much healthier place than it was two years ago.

​Perceptions of OPEC have undergone a profound transformation in the last two years. The “Declaration of Cooperation” has caused a great rejuvenation of our Organization and Industry.

​It is no coincidence that this has occurred at the same time as an intensification of OPEC’s engagement with Africa. African membership of both OPEC and the “Declaration of Cooperation” strategic partnership has increased, and other African partners engage with us across a broad range of fronts, including through their attendance at the OPEC/Non-OPEC Ministerial Meetings.

​I think one of the most important reasons why the “Declaration of Cooperation” has been successful is because at its heart; it has a fair, timely and transparent goal which can be articulated in four simple words: sustainable oil market stability. Our means for attaining that goal can be summarized in a similarly straight-forward manner: voluntary cooperation among nations.

​This approach resonates with the theme of our conference today “energy coalitions” and I encourage all producing countries from across this continent to consider joining us in our efforts to work in the interests of producers and consumers, as well as the global economy.

​When we began the “Declaration of Cooperation” journey in 2016, many doubted that we could achieve our goals. The health of the industry was such that some thought oil market stability would remain elusive forever.

​However, throughout our endeavors, we were inspired by the eloquent words of one of this magnificent nation’s greatest leaders and our personal hero, Nelson Mandela: Madiba constantly reminded us during these dark days of the downturn.

​A winner is a dreamer who never gives up.

​After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb.

​Sometimes it falls upon a generation to be great… May it be our generation!

​Participating countries persevered and hope was restored.

​We accept this Award on behalf of all of those participating countries, both OPEC and non-OPEC, who have done so much to transform the fortunes of our industry. And I dedicate it to all the hard working people representing those countries, in particular my colleagues at the OPEC Secretariat, for the outstanding work they have performed in the last two years. It would not have been possible without their hard work, commitment to duty and strive for excellence at all times.

​Looking to the future, OPEC will never cease to advocate for cooperation, collaboration and fraternity among nations as the best solutions to overcoming challenges, for as the old African proverb teaches us:

​If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.

​Thank you again and good night.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/123-5-september-2018.html"
"2018-09-05","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness…..it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair…

Of course, we will all recognize the immortal opening of Charles Dickens’ classic novel, “A Tale of Two Cities;” however, I believe that in these words we find an appropriate description of the experience of the international oil industry since late 2014.

Our industry has been on a remarkable journey during this period; it has undertaken profound changes; witnessed sobering lows, followed, thankfully, by dizzying heights. We have seen geopolitical events of immense significance, the development of new technologies and the breathtaking emergence of unexpected actors. And this has had significant repercussions, here in Africa; a continent brimming with promise in terms of economic development and investment opportunities.

This backdrop of ceaseless change means that forums such as this, which offer a platform to exchange views and perspectives, develop analysis and solutions, and facilitate energy investment and policy discussions; are not just to be encouraged: they are indispensable for the future of our industry.

In this regard, I would like to commend Africa Oil and Power (AOP) for organizing such a stellar event. I am also looking forward to exploring the first ever AOP Exhibition and Country Pavilions, which I have no doubt will be a tremendous success.

I would also like to bid my welcome to all of the participants, particularly the Ministers, CEOs and captains of industry assembled here, for their willingness and enthusiasm to participate and drive these outcome-orientated discussions forward. It’s a pleasure to be in your company.

I am also delighted to be in the beautiful nation of South Africa given that 2018 marks 100 years since the birth of Nelson Mandela, our legendary icon. May Madiba’s example continue to inspire all statesmen in their pursuit of public service, as well as leaders of our industry.

African countries have historically assumed strong, proactive leadership roles in OPEC. I am delighted that following a decision at the 174th OPEC Conference on 22 June 2018, the African continent gained an additional voice in our Organization: the Republic of the Congo became the fifteenth Member Country of OPEC. I am very pleased that today I have the opportunity to speak once again with my colleague and friend H.E. Jean Marc Thystere Tchicaya, Minister of Hydrocarbons, Republic of the Congo. Congo’s accession continues the positive trajectory which saw Gabon rejoin OPEC in 2016 and Equatorial Guinea join in 2017, thereby immeasurably enriching our Organization.

This consolidates the incredibly positive, constructive and fruitful roles played by Libya since it joined our Organization in 1962, Algeria since 1969, Nigeria since 1971 and Angola since 2006.

Indeed, the idea for our Organization was conceived in Africa, specifically Egypt. It was at the Cairo Yacht Club in 1959, that the Gentleman’s Agreement was forged which paved the way for the establishment of OPEC in Baghdad in September 1960.

Aside from the African countries who are OPEC members, two African countries have joined the historic “Declaration of Cooperation,” namely Sudan and South Sudan. I am extremely grateful for the dedication of these two countries for their unwavering commitment to global oil market stability.

Additionally, when the Third OPEC and Non OPEC Meeting took place on 30 November 2017, six additional countries issued declaration of support to the decision by participating countries to amend the “Declaration of Cooperation” to take effect for the entirety of 2018. Four of these countries hailed from this continent, namely, Chad, Congo, Egypt and Uganda.

Furthermore, when the 4th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting took place on 23 June 2018, four additional countries were present, all of which were African- Chad, Egypt, Uganda, and South Africa.

These facts show that not only is the African presence in OPEC thriving but also that we have an extremely productive and fruitful relationship with non-OPEC African countries and partners. It also reflects how widely OPEC’s battle-cry of working collaboratively to solve problems is being heeded.

I am delighted that today we are joined by the Secretary Generals of some of our partner international organizations. HE Dr. Sun Xiansheng continues to lead the IEF with immense skill, dedication and gravitas. He represents all the best virtues of our industry, as well as respect among nations. I am honoured to call him my twin brother.

H.E. Mahaman Laouan Gaya, Secretary General of APPO, is the personification of wise leadership and statesmanship. His commitment to the multilateral process and cooperation among international organizations has raised the stature and profile of the prestigious organization which he represents to even greater heights.

H.E. Yury Sentyurin, Secretary General of the GECF, is another titan of our industry and has done tremendous work since he assumed office at the start of this year. I have no doubt that under his sagacious leadership, the GECF will continue to achieve great feats in the noble pursuit of its objectives.

I would like to assure my three comrades that OPEC is determined to intensify cooperation with your Organizations.

Further underscoring the importance of this event is the judicious selection of the theme for the Conference, “energy coalitions.” Given the multitude of changes in our sector, the need for international cooperation is greater than ever.

As an intergovernmental organization, faith in multilateralism is integral to OPEC’s DNA. Our experience over the last two years has demonstrated the enduring capacity of collaboration among nations to surmount the greatest of challenges.

And when we look at recent history, we know our industry endured a challenge of titanic proportions during the last downturn. From 2014 to 2016, world oil supply growth outpaced that of oil demand, with world oil supply growing by 5.8 mb/d, while world oil demand increased by 4.3 mb/d.

By July 2016, OECD commercial stock overhang reached a record high of about 403 mb over the five-year average. The OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016.

Ominously, investments were choked-off, with exploration and production spending falling by an enormous 25% in both 2015 and 2016. Additionally, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued, and many thousands of high quality jobs were lost. A record number of companies in our industry filed for bankruptcy.

The magnitude of this situation led OPEC Member Countries and 10 non-OPEC producing countries to embark on a concerted effort to accelerate the stabilization of the global oil market. With the landmark “Declaration of Cooperation,” twenty-four (now twenty-five) oil producing nations agreed at the first OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting held on the 10th of December 2016 in Vienna, on voluntary production adjustments of around 1.8 mb/d. The Declaration has been subsequently amended to take effect until the end of 2018.

The “Declaration of Cooperation” has had a transformational impact on the global oil industry:

The OECD commercial stock overhang above the five-year-average has been reduced by more than 370 mb since the “Declaration of Cooperation” came into force, and switched to a deficit of around 41 mb in July 2018.

Going forward, the priority for the “Declaration of Cooperation” strategic partners is on ensuring stability is sustainable in nature, spreading confidence in the industry and encouraging an environment conducive to the return of investment. For this reason, we continue to explore means of further institutionalizing our cooperation.

Such an approach is necessary given trends expected in future world oil demand. In the period to 2040, the required global oil sector investment is estimated at $10.5 trillion to meet future world oil demand that is expected to surpass 111 mb/d by 2040. This represents a staggering increase of 16 mb/d. Indeed, the world will attain the 100 mb/d level of consumption in 4Q18, much sooner than projected. Therefore, stabilizing forces which create conditions conducive to attracting investment are essential.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It often may appear that our industry is subject to forces beyond our control. Geopolitical events, natural catastrophes, technological breakthroughs or other critical uncertainties: we are all aware of the impact they can have.

However, there is another force alive and well in our industry. This force exists in the desire of producers, consumers and investors, ordinary women and men throughout the world, to have sustainable stability in the oil market. This force thrives in the hearts and minds of decision makers who know that cooperation, collaboration and team-work remain the most effective problem-solving techniques this industry or indeed any industry knows. This force underpins the “Declaration of Cooperation” and encourages other stakeholders, many of whom are in this room, to lend their support to this noble cause.

This force can lead us out of any darkness and into the light. It is based on the principles of transparency, fairness, equity and respect among nations. It can be encapsulated in a simple phrase: cooperation for sustainable, oil market stability.

I have no doubt that this force will lead our industry into a new glorious future, with the interests of consumers and producers, firmly at its heart.

If we can channel the positive energy in this room towards this great endeavor, the possibilities are endless. Should our cooperation continue to evolve into a dynamic force-for-good; looking back years from now, we will be able to recall the closing words of Dickens in “A Tale of Two Cities,”

It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/124-5-september-2018.html"
"2018-07-03","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is my absolute privilege to address the Nigeria Oil and Gas Conference and Exhibition, which is in its seventeenth year. This is actually my first engagement outside of Austria since one of the busiest weeks in the history of OPEC, which included meetings, conferences and the 7th International OPEC Seminar. This makes it even nicer to return back to our magnificent home country!

I must confess, it does feel somewhat bitter-sweet to participate this year. Sadly, 2018 marked the passing of one of the fathers of this conference- Dr. Alirio Parra.

[Slide 3]
Although a Venezuelan, Dr. Parra was truly a global citizen and cared passionately about Nigeria. He was so concerned with this country’s welfare that he was gladdened by our successes as much as any Nigerian patriot. I know many of you considered his passing as a loss of one of our own.

He was the quintessential gentleman, a true OPEC pioneer, an oil industry innovator, a man who was always willing to share his great wisdom with others, and a witness to many historic OPEC moments.

How best to encapsulate the loss we all feel of Alirio’s sad passing while expressing the great joy we have in celebrating his momentous life? I can only do so by recalling the timeless Sonnet of William Shakespeare:

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
Which I new pay as if not paid before.
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end.

The continued success of this conference, typifies the rich legacy he bequeathed all of us.

Alirio worked closely with another great industry icon in creating this conference: Dr. Rilwanu Lukman, former OPEC Secretary General, Presidential Adviser and Minister of Petroleum Resources. Indeed, this conference is a result of their friendship.

As his adopted son, friend and close confidant, I can tell you firsthand that Dr. Lukman’s love of country was truly awe-inspiring. Like many people in this room, I owe him an enormous debt; as he was the greatest mentor I could possibly have hoped for. His legacy is felt as a mining engineer, in geoscience and in the hydrocarbon industry, but more importantly, he was a fundamentally warm and decent human being. He was a man of remarkable vision and embodied those immortal words of the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, which I now paraphrase:

Some men see things as they are and say, ‘why?’
Dr. Lukman dreamed things that never were and said, ‘why not?’

The memory of these two titans will inspire the next generation of industry leaders.

This is the second time in six months at which I have had the honour of addressing a premier energy event in Nigeria. In February, I was here at the maiden Nigeria International Petroleum Summit.

It is no surprise that our country continues to blossom as one of the key venues for major petroleum sector discussions. It is testimony to the immensity of Nigerian statesmanship.

[Slide 4]
For this reason, in March, the OPEC Bulletin, our monthly magazine, was a Special Edition dedicated to Nigeria. It was a celebration of the enormous contribution that Nigeria has made to the betterment of our Organization. The wealth and depth of Nigerian statesmanship was also discussed, and I would like to acknowledge some of the pillars who have done so much to elevate the international standing of our country.

I would like to pay tribute to the President of this great country, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari. President Buhari has made an invaluable contribution to OPEC’s recent landmark decisions and their ongoing successful implementation. He is a tremendous credit to our country through his integrity, Spartan lifestyle and patriotic dedication.

At OPEC, we very much consider President Buhari as ‘one of our own.’ An OPEC veteran, he has been heavily involved in the Organization’s affairs for decades and is currently the only serving Head of State in the world who made his career by being intensely involved in the OPEC family. He has maintained his avid interest in our Organization and we all draw inspiration from his commitment.

Nigeria enjoys world renown as a consensus builder and deal maker. A special gentleman who has made a colossal contribution to this is Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources. His diplomatic skill and gravitas were on display last week in Vienna during our bumper agenda of meetings. Once again, I commend you, Excellency, for your stellar work.

Indeed, we are very grateful for the high-level presence of Nigeria at the Seminar through a large delegation, which included many Nigerian companies and oil industry representatives that made a great contribution, including their generous sponsorship.

Further testimony to Nigeria’s prestige in the multilateral system is the fact that I am just one of several of my compatriots who hold senior positions in intergovernmental organizations. Amina J. Mohammed is Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN); Dr. Akinwumi Adesina is President of the African Development Bank; Dr. Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu is the current President of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Council; Dr. Benedict Okey Oramah is President of the African Export-Import Bank and Judge Chile Eboe-Osuji is President of the International Criminal Court.

My friends, these facts, Alirio and Lukman’s legacies, and Nigeria hosting two major international petroleum events this year means we can truly say that we are living through a golden era of Nigerian statesmanship. This is testimony to the way in which President Buhari has elevated the international profile of our country.

Nigeria has historically assumed, a strong, proactive leadership role in OPEC. I am delighted to be able to inform you that following a decision at the 174th OPEC Conference on 22 June 2018, the African continent gained an additional voice in our Organization: the Republic of the Congo became the fifteenth Member Country of OPEC. This is a tremendous boon for our entire Organization and continues the positive trajectory which saw Gabon rejoin OPEC in 2016 and Equatorial Guinea join in 2017.

Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,

At this very moment, as I speak, schoolchildren are boarding the bus to make their way to morning lessons. Mothers and fathers are returning home after working nightshifts. An elderly grandparent is being transported to see their doctor. Farmers are fertilizing their fields. Families are being reunited; communities are being brought together. And these are scenes being repeated millions of times here and across the globe.

What links these seemingly disparate scenes of everyday life? Petroleum. Indeed oil is so intrinsic in daily life that we sometimes overlook the fact that our industry has an impact on the individual experiences of billions of people.

And while I would not for a minute, suggest that our industry is perfect, I believe we can take pride in oil’s role in fueling modern civilization, lifting millions out of poverty and contributing to sustainable development.

Extreme volatility in the oil market has very negative consequences for such consumers and producers. Low oil prices are bad for producers today and create situations that are bad for consumers tomorrow. And high oil prices are bad for consumers today and lead to situations that are bad for producers tomorrow. Volatility is a devastating disincentive for investment, which is the lifeblood of our industry and essential for ensuring adequate supply in the future.

[Slide 5]
We saw this during the last industry downturn. From 2014 to 2016, world oil supply growth outpaced that of oil demand, with world oil supply growing by 5.8 mb/d, while world oil demand increased by 4.3 mb/d.

[Slide 6]
By July 2016, OECD commercial stock overhang reached a record high of about 403 mb over the five-year average. The OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016.

[Slide 7]
What was particularly ominous for consumers was the fact that investments were choked-off, with exploration and production spending falling by an enormous 25% in both 2015 and 2016. Additionally, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued, and many thousands of high quality jobs were lost. A record number of companies in our industry filed for bankruptcy.

[Slide 8]
Lack of investment on this scale has very serious repercussions for future consumers, especially given the increase in world oil demand which is expected in the long term. According to OPEC’s World Oil Outlook, long-term oil demand is expected to increase by 15 mb/d, rising from 94.5 mb/d in 2016 to 111.1 mb/d in 2040.

To meet the projected increase in global oil demand, investments worth an estimated $10.5 trillion will be required. Investment is also necessary to offset the impact of natural decline rates, which can be as high as 5% per year. To maintain current production levels, the industry might need to add upwards of 4 mb/d each year.

[Slide 9]
This background gives a sense of the gravity of the situation as OPEC and its non-OPEC partners held intensive discussions throughout 2016 to build consensus about the strategic urgency of rebalancing the global oil market in a collective manner. The situation was bleak, but as the saying goes, the darkest hour is the one just before the dawn.

So began the most intensive negotiations in the history of the Organization. Meetings lasted hours, days and nights. I witnessed displays of stamina in those sessions that I’ve never seen before in my life: including from our own Minister Kachikwu.

Thankfully, all these labours were not in vain. With the landmark “Declaration of Cooperation,” twenty-four (now twenty-five) oil producing nations agreed at the first OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting held on the 10th of December 2016 in Vienna, on a concerted effort to accelerate the stabilization of the global oil market through voluntary production adjustments of around 1.8 mb/d. The second OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, held on the 25th of May 2017, extended the voluntary production adjustments for another nine months commencing on the 1st of July 2017.

Following the third OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 30th of November 2017, the Declaration of Cooperation was amended to take effect for the whole year of 2018.

The 174th Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the 4th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, held on 22 and 23 June 2018, reaffirmed the partners’ unshakeable resolve to act in the interests of producers and consumers. Participating Countries agreed to strive to adhere to the overall conformity level of 100%, for the remainder of 2018.

[Slide 10]
The adjective which most appropriately describes the impact the “Declaration of Cooperation” has had on the global oil market is “transformational.”

[Slide 11]
Conformity with the voluntary adjustments in production has been extremely high: 147% in May 2018. The OECD commercial stock overhang above the five-year-average has been reduced by more than 370 mb since the Declaration of Cooperation came into force, and switched to a deficit of 35 mb in May 2018.

[Slide 12]
Contemporaneous with this improvement in oil market sentiment has been the synchronous economic growth the global economy is experiencing. Global economic growth is forecast at 3.8% for 2018. Correspondingly, global oil demand has also been on the rise increasing by 1.7 mb/d in 2018, with 4Q18 surpassing the mark of 100 mb/d.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

As I mentioned earlier, OPEC has had a particularly intensive schedule over the last fortnight. I would like to provide a brief overview of outcomes from the 7th OPEC International Seminar.

The Seminar was attended by over 900 delegates from 51 countries, representing the global community. Indeed, the Seminar was a multipurpose forum for dialogue among all stakeholders in the energy community, including both producers and consumers.

In preparing our Seminar, we were very much inspired by Nigeria’s great track record in organizing high level events, such as this conference and NIPS in February.

What was the watchword from these seminal events? Cooperation. The last year has demonstrated the enduring capacity of collaboration among nations to surmount obstacles.

As an intergovernmental organization, faith in multilateralism and international cooperation is integral to OPEC’s DNA. This faith manifests its modern expression in our strategic partnership with our non-OPEC partners, who honoured us through their active participation and engagement during the OPEC International Seminar.

Given this success, I once again extend an open invitation to all producing countries to consider joining us in our common mission to work towards sustainable market stability.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The ever-evolving nature of the petroleum sector means that industry leaders always face difficult decisions, must make hard choices and respond to events, both expected and unexpected. Success breeds success; where we find it, we must build on it, to make it sustainable.

The times we live in often appear turbulent and challenges daunting. Such is the pace of change that sometimes it can be difficult just to catch our breath. And yet, experience has repeatedly shown that the enduring principles of cooperation; collaboration and transparency can lead us out of any darkness and into the light.

May we always have the courage of our convictions and work together. With this in mind, I truly believe that the times we live in and how we respond to them can be encapsulated by the immortal words of Shakespeare in the play “Julius Caesar”:

There is a tide in the affairs of men.
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat,
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.

God bless you all and may He always bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/125-3-july-2018.html"
"2018-06-23","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​Welcome to the 4th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

​This is another landmark meeting for our ever-evolving and innovative cooperation. We are truly pleased to see so many OPEC Ministers and other Heads of Delegation from non-OPEC producing countries here with us today.

​I would also like to personally welcome my counterpart as co-Chair today, His Excellency Alexander Novak, Oil Minister of the Russian Federation. It is a great pleasure to share this platform with you.

​Our joint decision on 30 November 2017 to amend the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ to take effect for the whole year of 2018 was welcomed by the market and it is evident that it has played an extremely important role in helping to further rebalance the market and bring about more stability.

​The decision last year also pledged the full and timely conformity of OPEC and participating non-OPEC countries in accordance with the voluntary agreed production adjustments in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​In this regard, I am happy to report that we have seen overall monthly conformity levels well above 100% in the months since the last Ministerial meeting.

​This clearly demonstrates the commitment of participating countries to the restoration of market stability, which is intended to serve the long-term interests of producers, consumers and the global economy.

​There is no doubt that the hard work and shuttle diplomacy involved in bringing together OPEC and non-OPEC back in 2016 has been extremely valuable.

​Our 24 countries have made an extraordinary difference, through a common, collective and collaborative framework for cooperation. This has been broadly recognized by other producers, companies, as well as a number of global institutions.

​Here, it is also important to recognize the tremendous efforts of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), ably supported by the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) and the OPEC Secretariat, who have shown great diligence and commitment in helping achieve these concrete results.

​Moreover, the OPEC Secretariat has also organized a series of OPEC and non-OPEC Technical Meetings under the umbrella of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, the third of which took place earlier this week. These have achieved a commendable level of knowledge-exchange much coveted by our industry, and now constitute an essential part of our closer engagement.

​These supporting organs of our cooperation have helped guide and enhance the work we are undertaking. They are insightful and dynamic forums, producing high quality market analyses and valuable insights.

​Let me also stress here that there is no ceiling on how many countries can join the forum that is, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. There is an open invitation for all oil producers to join with us and work responsibly towards market rebalancing in the interests of all.

​I should like to acknowledge a number of additional non-OPEC producers that have joined us today in solidarity with the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. These are Chad, Egypt, Uganda, South Africa, as well as the African Petroleum Producers Association.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Yesterday, at the 174th Meeting of the OPEC Conference, we discussed the current oil market situation, the outlook for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019, and the future development of our cooperation. These issues will now be deliberated with Your Excellencies from the non-OPEC producers that are with us today.

​This means analyzing and evaluating where we stand today, as well as the outlook for the remainder of 2018 and into 2019. This will give us a clearer understanding of the rebalancing process and overall oil market stability.

​As we all know, in an increasingly interdependent world, with the oil industry a central element of this, the challenges we face can be complex. They need to be monitored on a regular basis, so that swift and informed decisions can be taken.

​It once again reinforces the importance of working in unison. It is vital that our hard-earned improvements are not compromised or lost.

​We need to keep in mind that it took all of us together to bring the oil market out of the wilderness, and we need to take these lessons into the future.

​Obviously our central focus remains on the present, but we should also not lose sight of the importance of institutionalizing this cooperative process into a broader framework to ensure continuity.

​I hope that this is something we can bridge today. It is an excellent occasion to further strengthen the foundation of our cooperation, to not only tackle the challenges before us, but also to realize the many opportunities we will have in the future.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/126-23-june-2018.html"
"2018-06-21","Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, friends,

​The English philosopher and Noble Prize winner Bertrand Russell once said, “The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.”

​Reflecting on our discussions over this Seminar, one cannot help but conclude that the future success of this industry indeed lies in the 3 “c’s”: cooperation; cooperation and cooperation.

​This is reflected in values that we in OPEC truly believe in. Openness, transparency, and respect for all nations and stakeholders. These core principles, which lie at the heart of international relations and multilateralism, can help guide our Organization and the petroleum industry to a bright, sustainable future.

​Interacting with all of you over the last day and a half, especially the young students and leaders of tomorrow, I bound with optimism that even though we have achieved so much in the past; our industry’s best days are ahead of us.

​OPEC means many things to different people. But this Seminar has once again shown that above all, OPEC is about people; OPEC is a community; and, most importantly, OPEC is a family. It is in this spirit that I will deliver a few words of thanks.

​Firstly, I would like to thank all our speakers, moderators, panelists and discussants who ensured our sessions were enlightening and illuminating. We are very grateful to have been joined by the crème de la crème of the energy industry, including over 100 Ministers, CEOs, heads of international organizations and other eminent industry leaders.

​I would like to pay particular tribute to our sponsors. They have faithfully answered our call for support and done an outstanding job in ensuring all our events and side-events have been exquisitely executed.

​Allow me to also thank the almost 900 delegates who have also played a tremendous role in ensuring this Seminar has been a success.

​We could not have done it without all of you here.

​OPEC is very blessed to have such distinct and diverse Member Countries. I would like to thank our 14 Member Countries for enriching this event.

​At the OPEC Secretariat, we feel truly humbled to provide support to each and every one of you.

​It is momentous that we have been joined by so many of our non-OPEC partners. The landmark “Declaration of Cooperation” was just a beginning and this Seminar has shown that this cooperation continues to evolve, and go from strength-to-strength.

​To the Government of Austria and the City of Vienna; the best way I can convey my gratitude is to quote the beautiful words of the famous song, “Vienna, City of My Dreams,” which sums up why many of us call this city our second home:

​My heart and my mind
is so full of Vienna
for Vienna as it weeps, as it laughs
that's where I know my way, that's where I'm at home

​A final word of thanks must go to all of my colleagues at the OPEC Secretariat, who have worked so tirelessly in the preparation for this Seminar.

​The OPEC Secretariat is a unique and special place to work for many reasons; but above all, it is because of the inspiring commitment and dedication of our staff. I have no doubt that all managers will be expressing their gratitude to their teams throughout the coming weeks.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, friends,

​Building trust and fostering dialogue between all stakeholders in the energy community is intrinsic to OPEC’s DNA. Thank you, one and all, for reciprocating our desire to promote knowledge exchange and mutual respect.

​I wish you all a safe journey home. We hope you found the Seminar enjoyable, informative and thought provoking.

​As we are in the city of music, I would like to leave you with one final thought from Halford Luccock, which encapsulates the common theme of this Seminar:

​No one can whistle a symphony. It takes a whole orchestra to play it.

​Thank you again.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/127-21-june-2018.html"
"2018-06-21","Salutation and Introduction

Your Excellencies and Distinguished Guests, welcome to the lovely and historic city of Vienna, where more history will be written this week as we continue our efforts, which have already produced gratifying results, to advance market stability for the benefit of both producers and consumers.

I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the great help provided by my Co-Chair, HE Alexander Novak, the Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, who just arrived from Moscow for our meeting.

I would like to also welcome several distinguished colleagues to the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, including:

Our discussion is taking place at a time of anxiety in many quarters about a supply deficit and this is materializing with inventories dropping below the 5 to 7 year average. There are calls from many major consuming nations for OPEC and our partners to take this important factor into consideration when making decisions. In my brief remarks, I would like to give special attention to this aspect of our deliberations.

Market developments

Before discussing our future course of action, though, I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to all members of the Declaration of Cooperation and our non-OPEC partners for their contributions over the past 18 months, which have had a demonstrably positive effect on the market. Over the past year and a half, conformity by the members has collectively exceeded 100 percent, and as a result, OECD commercial stocks have declined by some 370 million barrels, which many thought impossible when we began.

There is no doubt that OPEC and its partners have done an incredible job of returning the global oil market to health and stability—but that success would not have been possible without the sound analysis of market fundamentals that underpinned our decisions along the way.

The Joint Technical Committee, under the guidance of the JMMC, has done a remarkable job in that regard and has made our job at the ministerial level relatively easy.

On behalf of the entire JMMC, I would like to express our appreciation to the members of the Joint Technical Committee for their continued diligence and dedication.

As we are all aware, while the current market is strong and the long-term picture remains healthy, there could be bumps in the road ahead and the path could be tortuous. This means new challenges are certain to emerge. Each new development is unique and requires its own bespoke solution and response.

Continuous Market Stability

As I have stated before, to better deal with these challenges and complexities, we need to build upon our successful cooperation model and institutionalize its success through a broader and more permanent strategically focused framework. Such an approach allows us to continually monitor the market from 360 degrees; is capable of gauging a more complex, more rapidly evolving market; and is ready to proactively respond as the market evolves or events intervene.

In fact, we are already starting to face this changed situation and if we did not suitably adjust our course, we will run into a different set of problems than before, losing credibility with consumers across the world, and especially in developing countries where most growth is expected to be. Let me elaborate.

Demand in the second half will be more than the first half by two million barrels per day. And over the two years since the DOC went into effect, total global demand has increased by more than three million barrels while our supply has declined by 2.8 MMBD. OPEC analysis indicates that if we took no action, the supply deficit in the second half of the year could rise to an unacceptably high figure of 1.7 million barrels per day, and OECD inventories would be further drawn down by another 300 million barrels. But the downside does not stop there. This evolving situation could have an exceedingly negative impact on oil demand growth.

Another important factor that is starting to increasingly assert itself, and which we ought to keep in mind, is that the main growth engine in US shale oil production, the Permian, is coming under considerable downward pressure owing to pipeline infrastructure and resource constraints. That means the expansion of US shale oil is likely to significantly slow over the coming two years until those hurdles are resolved.

Returning to the growing importance of the work that the Joint Technical Committee and the JMMC do, our vision of a more effective and more inclusive OPEC and Non-OPEC partnership will only materialize and succeed if it is grounded in proactive, thorough and holistic analysis. Therefore, the work of these committees is taking on an ever greater significance. But based on the performance and achievements we have seen to date, I am confident that we and our committees are up to the task.

Conclusion

[Ladies and] Gentlemen, to recap, we need to be cognizant of market developments and to build on the current successes achieved through collective and more comprehensive action by OPEC and our non-OPEC partners led by Russia.

Our customers have spoken loudly and we must listen to them. We need to be responsible and responsive by releasing the right level of supplies.

And finally, let me reiterate that whatever decisions we take this year, next year and future years will require further action. In this environment, the role of our market monitoring and analysis mechanisms and the need for enhancements becomes even more critical.

Through a permanent and more inclusive cooperation framework that will help to ensure the long-term stability and sustainability of the oil market and impart it greater confidence—thereby making history even as we look toward the future.

Thank you for your attention today.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/128-21-june-2018.html"
"2018-06-20","Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,
Guten Morgen … Good morning.

I would like to welcome you all to the 7th OPEC International Seminar and the beautiful Hofburg Palace. It is a tremendous privilege and honour for me to personally welcome our moderators, all our speakers, all our sponsors, and of course all the hundreds of delegates I see before me this morning.

This year’s OPEC Seminar is the first to bring together so many producers, from OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as major consuming nations, elevating this 7th OPEC Seminar to a new level. They will speak alongside CEOs of national oil companies, international oil companies, independents, service companies and major think tanks; we have the heads of other international organizations; the head of the UNFCCC, IEA, IEF, GECF and, a host of eminent industry stakeholders.

I could go on. It is really a who’s who of global oil and energy industry leaders. The wisdom and insights of these leaders will undoubtedly provide for rich and engaging discussions.

The splendid palatial Hofburg that hosts our Seminar was the residence of Austrian sovereigns for over 600 years – the bastion of the House of Habsburg, and a focal point for the entire continent of Europe.

A great deal of European history was written at the Hofburg Palace. It was here where the Congress of Vienna met in 1814 and 1815, a meeting of ambassadors of European states chaired by legendary Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich. It was a meeting that many have credited as having created long-term stability across Europe.

In fact, Austria has a rich legacy of uniting people. This has not only been through its great diplomacy, which continues today, but also through marriage! As the famous saying goes: ‘Let others wage war: thou, happy Austria, marry’.

This emphasis on dialogue, and bringing people together, makes this venue an entirely appropriate location for this Seminar, with its central theme: ‘Petroleum – cooperation for a sustainable future’.

In addition, it is also a fitting location to recognize the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC nations that was initially put together in December 2016.

The impact of the historic cooperation has exceeded even the most optimistic of predictions. We have not only turned a historic page, but a new glorious chapter is being authored in the history of the industry by OPEC and its non-OPEC partners.

Bringing together 24 producing nations is unparalleled in the history of the oil industry. It is also a platform that is open to all producers.

The historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ literally rescued the oil industry from its worst ever downturn and now constitutes a fundamental and essential feature of the ‘new world of energy’.

Over the last 18 months, this cooperation has helped return more balance to the oil market, more optimism to the industry and has had a positive impact on the global economy and trade worldwide.

It has enabled industry investment to gradually pick up, albeit not yet to pre-2014/15 levels, and has resulted in many jobs returning and unemployment easing.

The importance of the Declaration has also received backing from other producers, as well as from consuming nations.

And it has also caused a significant change in industry-wide and public perceptions of OPEC. The Organization has ably demonstrated its credentials as a body committed to international cooperation, working with other producers, honouring its commitments and promoting mutual respect among all nations.

The Declaration underscores what can be accomplished through a constructive, continuous and fully committed approach to helping achieve a sustainable oil market stability.

However, we appreciate that our work never stops! We are fully committed to sustaining balance and stability in the market, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

In the coming months, we will look to institutionalize this long-term framework for continuity with an all-inclusive and broad-based participation, to look at some of the industry’s pertinent challenges, as well as the opportunities.

Just as the Congress of Vienna helped return stability to Europe, we also believe that the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has laid the foundation for longer term sustainable oil market stability.

It should be borne in mind that oil has played an indispensable role in fueling our modern civilization, stimulating economic growth, development and helping elevate billions of peoples across continents out of poverty.

And this essential fuel will no doubt be vital to future generations. We should not forget that today around 3 billion do not have clean fuels for cooking, and 1.1 billion have no access to electricity, something that all of us here take for granted.

When we start up our cars, switch on a light, turn on our mobile phones, we need to recognize that these everyday things are still unknown to billions of people across the world who continue to suffer from energy poverty. It is a universal obligation to address this major challenge in the energy transition. The future of oil and mankind are inextricably linked.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The importance of sustainable stability will no doubt be apparent over the course of this Seminar, as we tackle such issues as evolving a sustainable energy future; technology breakthroughs; the energy transition; the environment; oil industry challenges; investments; and, the global economy.

What is central to all of these topics is one word: cooperation.

It is vital all stakeholders work together to meet the challenges, as well as the opportunities before us, as the overall theme of the Seminar underscores.

As history has shown us, working together can help us build bridges, and achieve great things. As the great English poet John Donne aptly said:

“No man is an island entire of itself;
Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.”

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

With that I would like to wish all participants every success with the Seminar. Enjoy the event, interact and make the most of everything on offer.

I hope everyone leaves the 7th OPEC International Seminar proud to know that they are truly valued members of our OPEC family.

May the spirit of Vienna, this city of peace and dialogue, inspire us all.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/129-20-june-2018.html"
"2018-06-20","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​Welcome to Vienna’s Hofburg Palace for the 7th OPEC International Seminar, held under the theme ‘Petroleum – cooperation for a sustainable future’.

​I would like to thank everyone here today for being part of this prestigious event. As the President of the OPEC Conference, it is a tremendous honour to see so many Ministers from both producing and consuming countries, to have so many distinguished and high-level speakers on the agenda, and to welcome hundreds of delegates from all over the world.

​I would like to thank our moderators – Eithne Treanor and John Defterios – for their introductions and to Professor Meghan O’ Sullivan for helping set the scene.

​I would also like to offer great thanks to all those who have been involved in organizing this event, under the expert guidance of His Excellency Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, the OPEC Secretary General. What we see before us today is a testament to their hard work.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The OPEC Seminar allows us to examine and discuss the main issues and opportunities concerning the oil industry. It also provides an important event for us to pause and take stock of where our industry stands, today, in a global context.

​In this regard, allow me to initially take you back to the last OPEC Seminar held in June 2015.

​It was an extremely challenging time for the oil industry. The world’s oil supply was significantly outpacing demand, prices were on a downward trend, and companies were slashing investments and jobs.

​To many in the industry, it felt that the circumstances surrounding the downturn had completely overtaken their day-to-day work. And there was more hardship to come.

​Allow me to put what happened in some context:

​The OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016.

​Investments were hit hard, with exploration and production spending falling by a massive 27% in both 2015 and 2016. Overall, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued.

​And stock levels continued to build and build. Total OECD stock levels reached their highest level of over 3.1 billion barrels in July 2016.

​The seriousness of these developments led OPEC to embark on extensive consultations among OPEC Member Countries and between OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations in 2016.

​It was clear that there was a need for broad cooperation to turn the industry around, by bringing forward the rebalancing of the global oil market and helping build longer term sustainable market stability. No-one could act alone.

​The consultations gathered pace in the second half of 2016 and led to the historic production adjustment decisions reached by OPEC and participating non-OPEC producers at the end of 2016, or what is now known as the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​The past 18 months or so has shown it to be a great success, driven by the excellent conformity levels to the voluntary production adjustments.

​It has reintroduced a long-absent element of stability to the market – there is now far more confidence, trust and certainty in our industry, compared to two years ago.

​It is also a platform open to all producers. It has evolved into a broader continuity partnership that can work for everyone, across all timeframes.

​There is now global recognition that without this collaborative action, the market would have continued to exhibit extreme volatility and future uncertainty, with far-reaching negative consequences for producers, consumers, investors, the industry, and the global economy at large.

​While acknowledging some very major achievements we have made to date, we are also aware that our work is ongoing.

​We are continually monitoring the rebalancing process. We continue to consult with all industry stakeholders, taking on board their views and concerns. We will do what is necessary to maintain stability and support global energy security, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​One topic that I feel passionately about, and which is vital to maintaining stability in the future, is the return of more investment to our industry.

​It is important to remember what happened to investment levels over the past few years, and the fact that the oil demand outlook continues to look robust in the years ahead. We must not be short-sighted, or we risk a future period of volatility.

​In addition, we also see tremendous value in institutionalizing this cooperation into a long-term framework for continuity.

​Let me stress that OPEC’s commitment to market order and stability is unwavering. We recognize that these are the key ingredients to a sustainable global energy future for both producers and consumers, and for this current generation and the coming ones.

​It is also clear to us that what we have witnessed over the last few years underlines just how important collaboration is with all the main parties in the global petroleum sector.

​In this regard, this OPEC Seminar is part of our ongoing effort to promote dialogue and cooperation with all industry stakeholders.

​In addition, OPEC also recognizes the importance of developing new talent. For this reason, it has invited students from Member Countries and Austria to attend the Seminar. I should also like to welcome the young future leaders that have joined from ADNOC and Mubadala in the UAE. We welcome these individuals who will likely carry the industry’s torch into the future.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Over the next two days you will hear presentations and debates on the main facets of the global energy scene. Through the lively discussions that are sure to follow, we will undoubtedly learn from one another by exchanging valuable viewpoints.

​I hope you all find the next day and a half an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

​With that I would like to announce that the 7th OPEC International Seminar is now officially open.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/130-20-june-2018.html"
"2018-05-30","Your Excellencies,

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to return to the beautiful city of Baku, the cradle of the oil industry that has fuelled the current civilizations — hence the sustainable growth, development and prosperity witnessed across the regions of the world over the last century.

Azerbaijan was the location of many “firsts” in the historic development of this industry. Within three decades of the first oil well being drilled in 1846, the world witnessed the building of the first wooden oil derrick in 1871, the first distillery in 1876 and the first oil tanker ship in 1877.

From these simple beginnings, Azerbaijan’s industry has continued to flourish and grow, culminating in 1994 with the signing of what we refer to as the “Contract of the Century” in which Azerbaijan signed an extremely lucrative oil contract with an international consortium.

Since then, the Azeri oil industry has experienced steady expansion, and, to this day, investors continue to value the growth potential that this great country can offer through its rich resources in both oil and gas.

These milestones would never have been reached without a skilled and dedicated local workforce. Time and again, their expertise, hard work and integrity contributed to the successful completion of many complex projects across this country.

All of these achievements were attributed to the stable and forward-looking policies, visionary leadership, and investor-friendly, transparent environment.

There is no clearer illustration of this than the impressive Shah Deniz project. The second phase of the project was commissioned yesterday by President Ilham Aliyev, himself an industry veteran. This multi-billion dollar capital investment is one of the largest energy project developments in the world with huge, positive multiplier effects on the domestic oil and gas sector, as well as on the country’s economy, on the region and the world as a whole.

The Southern Gas Corridor is changing the energy landscape in a fundamental way. It is poised to further enhance and strengthen energy security in an increasingly uncertain world. President Aliyev aptly captured it yesterday when he asserted that energy security guarantees national security.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I was last here in Baku a little more than two months ago, from 18 to 19 March, and had the great honour of meeting His Excellency, President Ilham Aliyev, along with His Excellency Parviz Shahbazov, Minister of Industry and Energy, and other senior officials.

We had fruitful discussions on Azerbaijan’s ongoing cooperation with OPEC as part of the historic OPEC-non-OPEC Declaration of Cooperation, and we explored opportunities for enhanced collaboration in the future.

Excellencies, we are grateful for your steady support and excellent contributions, and look forward to continuing to work very closely with you as, together, we move forward to enhance this framework of cooperation.

And lastly, I would like to recognize, with utmost gratitude and respect, His Excellency, the late Natig Aliyev, who, up until his untimely passing last year, was a driving force in the lead-up to the Declaration of Cooperation. I assure you, he, and the rich legacy he leaves, will be fondly remembered.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The historic Declaration of Cooperation − voluntarily entered into by 24 countries and in which Azerbaijan played a leading role − literally rescued the oil industry from its worst downturn and has fundamentally changed the energy landscape.

The effective implementation of the Declaration has halted the worst oil market downturn in history, reversing the decline by enhancing the rebalancing process. Here, the huge overhang of more than 400 million barrels was removed, and thereby using a 5-year average was a useful reference to closely monitor and evaluate the stock levels in a complex global supply and demand equation.

The next critical phase in the whole process is to sustain these accomplishments of market rebalancing, a gradual recovery in investments and the return of confidence in the industry.

How will we achieve this? Going forward, through a broader and institutionalized framework of cooperation based on the Declaration’s core principles of equity, fairness and transparency, we will look into developing metrics and designing mechanisms to help govern against future shocks and extreme volatility in the market.

Ladies and gentlemen,

As the implementation phase continues to advance and we take stock of the successes we have accomplished thus far, we must also step back and consider the larger picture and the perspectives over the medium to long term.

One of the greatest and most pressing challenges before us is ensuring that there will be adequate levels of investment in a predictable fashion to meet the world’s future requirements.

So far in 2018, the pace of investment has gradually picked up, yet we are still not seeing enough robust investment in long-cycle projects, which are the baseload of future supply, and the foundation of this industry’s future.

In the period to 2040, the required global oil sector investment is estimated at $10.5 trillion to meet future world oil demand that is expected to surpass 111 million barrels a day by 2040. This represents a staggering increase of 16 million barrels a day. Indeed, the world will attain the 100 million barrels a day level of consumption much sooner than projected.

This is a clarion wake-up call that every effort should be made to avoid a potential supply gap that could present a serious challenge to the industry in the medium to long term.

This will be essential, not only to maintain current production levels under given natural decline with compensation needs at 4% to 5%, but also to ensure a steady flow of oil to meet rapidly growing demand in the long term. It will also be a key foundation for future global economic expansion.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I am convinced that the only way to meet these current and future challenges is through close cooperation and dialogue with like-minded partners.

With the Declaration of Cooperation, we have initiated a new era in international energy collaboration, the likes of which the world has never seen before. What is required is to build upon this model process. We must institutionalize it and expand it even further for a sustainable market stability beyond the short term.

Our collective efforts in last 16 months will go down in the history books of this great industry as the most courageous collective resolve by a broad coalition of OPEC and non-OPEC producers to rise together to address the challenge of restoring much needed market stability on a sustainable basis. And there’s no better place to remind ourselves of that than here in Azerbaijan, where it all began almost 150 years ago as the cradle of our industry.

In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to invite the world’s global oil producers to join OPEC and its non-OPEC partners as we continue to work towards bringing about a lasting stability in the global oil market. All major stakeholders stand to benefit, including consumers, as together we pave the way for future economic growth and prosperity for current and future generations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/131-30-may-2018.html"
"2018-05-29","​Honourable President Ilham Aliyev,

​Your Excellencies,

​Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is truly a great pleasure to be here at the Sangachal Terminal on the Caspian Sea to not only witness the opening ceremony of the important 25th International Caspian Oil and Gas Exhibition and Conference, but also the opening of stage 2 of the magnificent Shah Deniz project.

​Mr President, Shah Deniz is clear evidence of your visionary leadership, and the motivation and determination that you and your great people have for the country of Azerbaijan. This second stage, to support the already flourishing first stage of the project, is a huge multi-billion dollar capital investment and one of the largest integrated energy projects in the world.

​It is an inspiring project; one that the whole country of Azerbaijan should be proud of. It generates significant added value to Azerbaijan’s economy, and more depth to its hydrocarbon sector.

​It is also a testament to great partnerships, with the Shah Deniz project operated by BP, and including many oil and gas companies that are from countries in the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations.

​This obviously includes your own national oil company, SOCAR, as well as the National Iranian Oil Company, Russia’s Lukoil and Petronas from Malaysia.

​It is also a partnership that is an exemplary reference for effective and lasting producer and consumer cooperation. It will enable more Caspian gas resources to flow along the Southern Gas Corridor, and in turn, contribute to global security, in particular in Europe.

​As the great Henry Ford once said: “If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.”

​I was last here in Azerbaijan, only two months ago. Mr President, I had the great honour of meeting you then, as well as HE Parviz Shahbazov, Minister of Industry and Energy, where we discussed a variety of issues, including the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​I would like to reiterate my thanks for your ongoing cooperation with OPEC, and for your support and full-throttled commitment to the voluntary production adjustments, with Azerbaijan consistently one of the highest performing countries in terms of conformity.

​It is also a great pleasure to be able to continue our discussions on the possible opportunities for enhancing our collaboration. I know that we all see value in further institutionalizing the remarkable cooperation that has evolved and flourished through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ over the past 18 months.

​This has been a true reflection of the committed leadership role your esteemed country has played in the whole process, and your far-sighted appeal for closer engagement among producers to restore oil market stability.

​In this ever more complex, interdependent and global market, it is vital that all industry stakeholders work together for sustainable stability that is in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​Mr President,

​Your Excellencies,

​Looking forward to the next two days, on behalf of OPEC, I am honoured to be participating in this landmark edition of the Caspian Oil & Gas conference and exhibition.

​To celebrate its 25th anniversary this year, is truly a tremendous achievement. OPEC congratulates you on this.

​I wish everyone involved a successful event.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/132-29-may-2018.html"
"2018-05-16","​Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​I am delighted to be here today. Uzbekistan’s fertile lands, rich natural resources, and colourful cotton and silk handicrafts have always piqued my curiosity. But it is the city of Tashkent that has always seemed a historical wonder to me.

​For this opportunity, I would like to thank the organizers of this 22nd International Exhibition and Conference, as well as the Government of Uzbekistan and, specifically, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan, under whose patronage this Conference takes place. With 21 previous editions of this gathering, this year’s event is a proud achievement.

​I am genuinely pleased to participate in this high-level plenary session focusing on the benefits and knowledge-sharing that flow from the expansion of international cooperation. In fact, the spirit of collaboration, cooperation and integration are elements that are very important in today’s increasingly complex and interdependent world, where the forces of globalization have become irreversible.

​Allow me to also extend our deep appreciation to His Excellency Ulugbek Sayidov, First Deputy Chairman of the Governing Board of JSC Uzbekneftegaz – we had a very fruitful bilateral meeting yesterday as a continuation of our enhanced cooperation with Uzbekistan; and His Excellency Yuri Sentyurin, Secretary General of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum. I look forward to hearing their insights and valuable perspectives this afternoon.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​We are gathered here at a time when the Republic of Uzbekistan is strategically poised in several unique ways.

​The oil and gas industry has been one of Uzbekistan’s most important growth sectors. In the Central Asian region, the country is one of the earliest sites of exploration and production, dating back more than 100 years. With such a respectable history and trajectory, its oil and gas industry continues to develop under recent economic reforms. And though the overall current volumes may be considered modest, the sector’s promise and the potential for even higher levels of production remain positive, with the hydrocarbons industry in recent years attracting international attention and interest. It is now a leading sector in this increasingly prosperous nation.

​Uzbekistan, in short, is a dynamic country, and its relevance and standing continue to grow. This Exhibition and Conference then is a very clear sign of that attention, with various stakeholders and ‘potential suitors’ expressing their keen interest in investing here.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​All these elements – resources, infrastructure, geography and international interest – put the country in a very unique position. But, it has also played a very special role in supporting the recent work that OPEC and other non-OPEC oil producers have done. Thus, allow me to pause here and extend our appreciation, on behalf of OPEC and its Member Countries, to Uzbekistan for its ongoing support for our noble cause. I would like to take a few moments to put this cause into perspective.

​The prolonged market downturn that we experienced in 2014-2016 was unprecedented. Although we all recognize that there are natural commodity cycles, our own research has shown at least six distinct price cycles over the last few decades – with this last one being the deepest and most protracted. In fact, its impact was felt around the world and across industries. No one was insulated!

​In addition, the growing complexity of markets in recent years made this unprecedented downturn a source of serious concern, posing a major challenge for all of us. The wide recognition of the adverse implications eventually led to the inevitable call for broader cooperation among stakeholders to address this serious challenge. This we did.

​OPEC, in cooperation with a group of 10 other non-OPEC producers, held extensive consultations in the latter half of 2016. This effort eventually achieved an historic decision in December 2016 of voluntary adjustments under the name of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. We have now been implementing this decision for the past 17 months with visible positive outcomes that have been widely acclaimed around the world.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​The success of this Declaration has been undeniable with conformity rates reaching impressive levels throughout 2017, rising to well above 130% in recent months. In March, it reached a new record of 149%.

​An additional six producers – including Uzbekistan – have provided further impetus to our efforts by declaring their solidarity with the Declaration. We recognize and applaud Uzbekistan’s participation in this ‘Declaration of Support’ and for supporting the goals and objectives of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. In addition to leveraging the critical and strategic value of its own oil and gas industry, the fact that Uzbekistan has chosen to work collaboratively with other global producers is a sign of true dedication to this process of international dialogue and cooperation.

​Similarly, the achievements and impact of the implementation of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ have been welcome by all. In the short term, it has contributed to a stabilization of the market.

​In terms of the short-term impact on the growing stock overhang, the achievements have been significant, with the collective efforts of the producers involved continuing to yield positive results. OECD commercial stock levels have been adjusted from a peak of 3.12 billion barrels in July 2016 to 2.83 billion barrels in March 2018, corresponding to a drop of 300 million barrels, and the stock overhang has been reduced by 400 million barrels.

​At the same time, we are seeing robust demand growth, which is forecast at around 1.65 mb/d in 2018. This, in turn, is supported by a healthy global economic outlook, with GDP growth expected at around 3.8% for this year. We also witnessed prices rebound from a low of below $30/b in January 2016 to recently reach the highest levels we have seen since November 2014.

​These are excellent indicators of the effectiveness of our shared efforts in the wake of the market downturn of a few years ago. Today, however, our concern is continuity with the proven success of this decision – with a view towards its sustainability in the long term.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ was not just about restoring market balance in the short term. It was also about ensuring the continuity of that new cooperation into the long term. In this, three key words come to the fore: fairness among all participants in the Declaration, transparency of production levels and verifiability through well-established mechanisms for monitoring and implementation of the Declaration – that is, the JMMC and the JTC.

​While the smooth and reliable implementation of the Declaration has had several significant outcomes, one of the most important is that it is gradually fostering the enabling environment for the rebound in investments, which sharply contracted by about 25-27% in 2015 and 2016.

​In fact, I would suggest that Uzbekistan’s leaders are quite cognizant of the importance of creating an enabling, secure environment for investments. The reform process being undertaken demonstrates their understanding that the industry itself needs investments to take the sector to the next level of development. This means investing in innovation to create value and ensure future supplies, in addition to fostering diversification across the entire value chain.

​According to OPEC’s most recent World Oil Outlook (WOO), the majority of the energy demand growth in the 2015-2040 period comes from non-OECD countries with around 29 mboe/d, while some 5 mboe/d is located in the mature markets of OECD countries.

​Long-term oil demand is expected to increase by 15.8 mb/d, rising from 95.4 mb/d in 2016 to 111.1 mb/d in 2040. In the long term, more than half of the oil demand growth is expected to be satisfied by light products. Separately, the demand for middle distillates is anticipated to increase by 6.8 mb/d during the forecast period.

​Of course, investments are the only way to ensure that this is maintained – specifically investments that are timely, adequate and continuous. And, although many recent conversations and exchanges among stakeholders have focused on short-cycle investments, what is most needed is steady, long-cycle investments, which represent the global base load.

​It’s worth recalling that our industry is very capital-intensive and technology-driven. Complex by nature, it requires significant up-front investments. But even after such financial resources have been secured, the industry is susceptible to myriad challenges, both regional and global.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​One of the important lessons learned from the most recent and perhaps worst prolonged oil market downturn in history is this: We must always be vigilant of market signs and indicators; and that we must always have the mid and long term in mind as we make our short-term calculations and decisions. Recognizing that something needed to be done in direct response to this recent market downturn was a positive, constructive response by responsible global producers.

​Another lesson, however, is that we can and should no longer act in isolation. The complexity and interrelated nature of markets and economies today requires concerted efforts to ‘not go it alone’ and to instead seek ways to work together in common cause. Collective problems require collective responses – and this is something that the international community continues to learn.

​Let me also add here that we must also expand and institutionalize this powerful international dialogue and cooperation if we hope to effectively address the major global challenges related to climate change and the environment, sustainable development and energy poverty.

​In this context, let me say that OPEC continues to be actively engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement. It is our firm belief that a global consensus through multilateral channels remains the optimum way for all nations to collectively counter climate change in a fair and equitable manner. All energy sources will be required, especially to meet the dire needs of the estimated 1.1 billion people in developing countries that have no access to electricity and the 2.3 billion without commercial energy.

​Here, there is an opportunity to work together to develop and adopt innovative technologies, as well as energy policies that are fair and inclusive. These concerted efforts will have the potential to improve the environmental credentials of all energy sources.

​The signatories of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ welcome any additional support from the world’s other producers. Expanding the ‘circle of trust’ to include other countries, whether they form part of the original decision or whether they simply offer their gracious support like Uzbekistan, the task of working together is vital for the good of market stability. And as Uzbekistan seeks to expand its own industry, revitalizing it through investments, joint ventures and collaborative efforts with other producers, we will see it find its natural place in this ongoing adjustment process.

​Thank you for your kind attention. I now wish you all a splendid time at this Conference and Exhibition.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/133-16-may-2018.html"
"2018-05-07","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​I am honoured, humbled and deeply moved to receive the Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah Energy Award for Lifetime Achievement for the Advancement of OPEC. To be the recipient of an award brandishing His Excellency’s name is overwhelming. I thank His Excellency, Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, as well as the distinguished Selection Committee and the organizers of this event, Gulf Intelligence.

​Unfortunately, His Excellency cannot be with us tonight. I would like to wish him a speedy recovery. The oil industry is worse off for his absence and we are all looking forward to his return.

​Throughout his career, His Excellency has shown remarkable skill, charm, intrepidity, loyalty and decency. Over the decades I have known him, my respect and admiration have continuously grown. In particular, I enjoy his wonderful wit and sharp sense of humor. Abu Hammad is a living legend, an icon of the oil industry; a man who is frank and extremely humble.

​I would also like to thank His Excellency Dr. Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Minister of Energy and Industry, for those very kind words. I cherish the warm memories of working together, especially during the very intense negotiations in 2016, when he distinguished himself as president of the OPEC conference.

​I accept this award at a time of momentous change for OPEC. The Organization has received a new impetus from the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation.’ Relations with our Non-OPEC partners intensify on a daily basis as we explore further opportunities to institutionalize our partnerships.

​This Award acknowledges these efforts, encouraging all to continue on this remarkable journey.

​I would like to conclude by thanking all members of the OPEC family, heads of delegations, governors, national representatives, officials, dignitaries, ambassadors, and representatives from our non-OPEC partners, as well as colleagues and friends who have all helped to shape the face of our organization.

​Let us remain focused on the remaining challenges and, working together, achieve a better tomorrow, in the interests of producers, consumers, current and future generations.

​Thank you for your kind attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/134-7-may-2018.html"
"2018-05-07","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is a distinct honour for me to make some introductory remarks in tribute to my dear friend, the OPEC Secretary General, HE Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, who is being awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for the Advancement of OPEC.

​Before I begin I would like to wish HE Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah a full and speedy recovery. We all miss him dearly and I know he would have enjoyed this event tonight.

​OPEC is in Mohammad Barkindo’s blood. He doesn’t just view the Organization merely as an employer or the Secretariat as a building. Rather HE Barkindo is a true believer in OPEC’s and, indeed, the oil industry’s capacity to be a force for good in our world; fueling modern civilization and lifting millions out of energy poverty.

​This has been a constant theme throughout his long and distinguished career: Born in April 1959, in Yola, Adamawa State, Nigeria, Barkindo holds a B.Sc degree in Political Science, a Postgraduate Diploma in Petroleum Economics and Management, and a Master’s degree in Business Administration.

​For 23 years he worked with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, culminating in his appointment as Group Managing Director in January 2009.

​HE Barkindo has long been involved in OPEC affairs. He served for a record 15 years as Nigeria’s OPEC National Representative and was also OPEC Governor. In 2006, he was made Acting OPEC Secretary General.

​HE Barkindo became OPEC Secretary General in August 2016, when Qatar was holding the Presidency of the OPEC Conference.

​I have many treasured memories of His Excellency during that momentous second half of 2016.

​I recall his visit to Doha in September, and our talks about navigating a path to help resurect the industry from the downturn that had gone on too long.

​Another highlight was a meeting we put together with HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, and other producers, on the margins of the 23rd World Energy Congress in Istanbul in October 2016. This proved to be a seminal moment in the evolution of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/135-7-may-2018.html"
"2018-04-20","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, Your Highness, distinguished delegates,

​On behalf of the entire OPEC Secretariat team, I’d like to thank HE Khalid Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Chairman of the JMMC, for the outstanding arrangements made for our meetings this week. I’d also like to thank his team for their tireless work, in particular Eng. Adeeb Al-Aama, Governor for OPEC; Dr. Nasser A. Al-Dossary, National Representative, and other representatives of Saudi Arabia.

​The gracious hospitality which our hosts have generously extended to us is typical given the historical tradition of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country which I first visited in 1977 (41 years ago) and have eagerly returned to at least once every year, since then. The people here have opened their homes in Jeddah, Makkah and Madinah to welcome strangers of all nationalities, for centuries. Therefore, the generous hospitality extended to us is part of this rich tradition.

​This is the fourth time that the JMMC has convened outside of Vienna. We have had meetings in Kuwait City, Kuwait; St. Petersburg, in the Russian Federation; Muscat, Oman and here today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

​Rotating the location in this manner means that aside from conducting our regular business; the enduring bonds of friendship between all of our great participating countries, OPEC and non-OPEC alike, are further strengthened. This week, we celebrate the enormous contribution the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made to OPEC throughout the last 58 years.

​In this regard, it is a great honour for me to pay tribute to His Majesty King Salman Bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud, Custodian Of The Two Holy Mosques. His Majesty played an absolutely pivotal role in the run up to the adoption of the landmark, historic decisions in 2016. This was a demonstration of the noble skills of statesmanship, flexibility and accommodation of the highest order; inspiring others involved to try and emulate His Majesty’s outstanding example.

​A crucial milestone, the positive ramifications of which are still being felt to this day, was the “breaking of the ice” meeting between His Highness Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the margins of the 2016 G20 Hangzhou Summit, in China. This courageous step, particularly the warm rapport developed between the two leaders, has played an immense role in our subsequent successes. Therefore, it is incumbent on me to express my gratitude and deep appreciation to the Crown Prince for his leadership, which is being ably demonstrated through Saudi Vision 2030.

​I’d also like to register my tribute to our indefatigable Chairman, Minister Al-Falih. His tireless dedication and leadership have encouraged all of us to strive for new standards of excellence, as we fulfil our responsibilities as oil producers.

​Like the first district of Vienna, where our OPEC Secretariat is located, “Historic Jeddah, the Gate to Makkah,” is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. And when one reads UNESCO’s explanation of why the city earned that status, it reinforces why it is such an appropriate location for our meeting today.

​The spirit of Jeddah, the principles of international collaboration and respect are also encapsulated by the magnificent working relationship between Minister Al-Falih and Minister Novak.

​It is my sincere hope that their warm relationship will survive a certain event in June. I am of course referring to the opening match of the FIFA World Cup in Moscow between the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia. I think from the perspective of the “Declaration of Cooperation,” we should hope for a tie or draw in that game, lest it disrupt the harmony between the two Ministers! To be honest though, I will have my own worries a few days later, when my home country, Nigeria, face Argentina!

​Mr. Chairman, this JMMC will go down as a watershed moment, in transforming the global oil industry. So once more, I thank our hosts and I wish us all fruitful and productive discussions.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/136-20-april-2018.html"
"2018-04-16","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is always a great pleasure to return to Kuwait, my second home, a founding member of OPEC, and a country that is fondly called jewel of the Gulf.

On behalf of the OPEC family, I would like to thank our esteemed Emir, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah for his personal and active engagement in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, not only in reaching out to other Heads of State during the initial consultations, but in the implementation process too. His exemplary leadership and unparalleled wise guidance has been a key part of the success we have achieved.

HE Al-Rashidi, Kuwait’s Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity and Water, a true friend and advocate of OPEC, extended to me a personal invitation to speak here today. I greatly appreciate the gesture and I am delighted to speak at the 5th Kuwait Oil & Gas Show (KOGS).

Given that this event is organized by CWC, I also feel it is apt to say a few words about a great man, Dr. Alirio Parra, who sadly recently passed away.

He was an OPEC and oil industry legend, having been involved in the setting up of the Organization and for a number of years he was Venezuela’s Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons. And in more recent times, he served as a Member of the Board of CWC, helping put on industry exhibitions and conferences around the world, such as this one here today.

He was a proud son of Venezuela, a citizen of the world, a scholar, a real oil man, and above all, a great friend. He will be greatly missed by all of us in OPEC and the industry.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The overall theme of this conference is – ‘New Energy Era: Transformation, Diversification and Integration’. I am sure there will be many ideas, concepts and views shared on this topic over the next couple of days, but please allow me to initially offer some from OPEC’s perspective as a means to help set the scene for the sessions to come.

There has been much talk of a ‘new energy era’, or what some might term an ‘energy transition’ at recent events I have attended, including last week’s 16th International Energy Forum Ministerial in New Delhi.

It begs the question: what does this actually mean?

I think one thing that all of us can agree on is the fact that the world will need more energy in the decades to come for the foreseeable future. It is easy to appreciate why.

In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2017, published in November last year, the global economy is estimated to more than double by 2040. And over the same timeframe, world population is projected to reach around 9.2 billion, an increase of around 1.8 billion.

We should also not forget that today around 3 billion do not have clean fuels for cooking, and 1.1 billion have no access to electricity, something that we take for granted.

When we start up our cars, switch on a light, turn on our mobile phones, we need to recognize that these everyday things are still unknown to billions of people across the world who continue to suffer from energy poverty. It is a universal obligation to address this major challenge.

We expect global energy demand to increase by 35% in the period to 2040.

At the same time, however, we need to recognize the threat posed by climate change to our environment. Let me stress here that OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement. We believe a global consensus out of the multilateral process remains the best and most inclusive way for all nations to collectively tackle climate change in a fair and equitable manner.

So while the world will need more energy, it also needs to use it more efficiently and continually look to develop, evolve and adopt cleaner energy technologies.

To put it simply, the basic energy challenge of the ‘new energy era’ can be summed up in two questions:

What is clear is that all forms of energy are required. The world of energy will be more diversified in the years ahead.

Renewables are projected to record the fastest annual growth rate, averaging 6.8% per annum in the period to 2040.

However, by 2040, the combined contribution of renewables, hydro, nuclear and biomass are expected to account for just 26% of the global energy mix, an increase of 7% from today.

In terms of oil and gas, combined they are still expected to provide more than half of the world's energy needs by 2040, with their combined share relatively stable between 52–53% over the almost 25-year forecast period.

In terms of oil, we expect it to reach over 111 mb/d by 2040, an increase of around 15 mb/d. We are expected to hit 100 mb/d during the course of this year, much earlier than initially forecast. On top of this, we should also remember that oil producers and companies must invest heavily simply to offset the impact of natural decline rates, which is annually around 4 mb/d.

For oil, it means that there is no expectation for a peak in oil demand over the forecast period to 2040. This is not only the projection of OPEC, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) too.

To put this into an investment perspective, in the period to 2040 the required global oil sector investment is estimated at a huge $10.5 trillion. This also needs to be placed in the context of the fact that globally more than a trillion dollars of frozen capex or cuts were witnessed during 2015 and 2016.

In this regard, I commend Kuwait and its able and visionary leadership for its laudable investment plans announced earlier this year for the country to spend more than half a trillion dollars by 2040 to boost its oil and gas output and refining capacity.

This includes plans to more than double refining capacity by 2035 and to boost oil production to 4.75 mb/d by 2040. These developments are not only important for Kuwait, but they will be vital to the industry and consumers in the years and decades ahead. The longevity of oil as a desirable energy source can only be guaranteed by such bold and visionary investment plans.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Thus, in looking ahead, we need to be realistic about what each energy source can provide, and continually look to transform how we extract, process, supply and use all the energies needed in the future.

This should not only be through the concerted and continued development of renewable energies. It also needs to be through the development of technologies in the oil & gas industry to enhance efficiencies, in both production and use, streamline working practices, and further improve their environmental footprint.

This requires innovation and human ingenuity, just as it has in the past.

For example, our industry has seen technological innovation move E&P opportunities from onshore to offshore, then to deep water and frontier regions, and most recently to unconventionals.

Improvements in the quantity and quality of information about different geological formations have meant we have been able to find more oil and gas.

When looking at recovery rates, technological developments have helped increase these from less than 10% of oil in place in the early history of the industry to more than 70% in some fields today.

Advancements have also improved the safety of our industry; for those working in it, and also in terms of exploration, production and supply.

And they have allowed us to continually improve the environmental credentials of oil and gas, both in production and use.

The industry’s past successes are a reminder that innovation and new technologies are the key to unlocking the abundant sources of oil and energy in an ever more sound, secure and responsible manner.

And as an industry, the challenge of emissions is one that we need to face head on. I am a firm believer that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions.

In this regard, the world has made little progress. Therefore more work and collaboration are urgently required. We need to continually look at the development and use of cleaner technologies, such as carbon capture utilisation and storage and many others in the future.

At OPEC, we welcome coordinated action with the industry and through various research and development platforms.

It is vital that we collectively develop and adopt technologies, as well as all-inclusive energy policies, that would address carbon emissions, not to crowd out investments in oil.

We truly believe we need to work towards a more integrated industry, at all levels. We need to continually break down barriers; we cannot work in silos. This is vital in an increasingly interdependent and complex world.

This is readily apparent in the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

This integrated approach to tackle the oil market downturn and return balance and stability to the market is unparalleled in the history of the oil industry.

Moreover, the past 15 months or so has shown it to be a great success, driven by the unprecedented conformity levels voluntary production adjustments. In 2017, it averaged 109%, and for the most recently reported months, February saw a level of 138% and in March the figure is expected to be even higher.

In looking at the current oil market situation, there is no doubt that the industry is starting to feel a much warmer glow. The overall market fundamentals have not been this strong since the onset of the current cycle.

In 2017, the global economic recovery gathered momentum. This positive trend is expected to be maintained in 2018 with an extremely healthy growth forecast of 3.8%.

Correspondingly, global oil demand growth has been robust and strengthening. It is expected to grow by 1.63 mb/d in 2018, following a similar trend in 2017.

And the OECD stocks overhang has fallen from around 400 million barrels (mb) against the five-year average in February 2016, to a level below 40 mb, a trend that will continue in the coming months.

We have not only turned a historic page, but a new chapter is being authored in the history of the industry by OPEC and its non-OPEC partners, who continue to demonstrate the power of cooperation and dialogue to restore stability and growth in the global oil market, and the knock-on positives of this for the global economy.

Moreover, in the months ahead we will look to institutionalise this long-term framework for continuity with an inclusive and broad-based participation, to look at some of the pertinent challenges, as well as opportunities, I have highlighted in this speech.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In talking of a ‘new energy era’ I earlier put forward two questions.

In looking at these, it is clear that we will need a diversified energy mix; the transformative use of technologies across all energy sources; and a more integrated and holistic industry.

Diversification, transformation and integration – all three are inter-connected. And the over-arching issue for all of these is ‘stability’.

Stability is the key ingredient to a sustainable global energy future for us and the coming generations.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/137-16-april-2018.html"
"2018-04-11","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.
​Good morning.

​I am deeply honoured to participate at the International Energy Forum’s 16th Ministerial Meeting. I want to thank the Government of India for hosting this event, along with the Governments of the People’s Republic of China and Korea for acting as co-hosts.

​I also want to thank the IEF’s most noble Secretary General, HE Dr. Sun Xiansheng, who I have come to deeply respect over the course of our mutual engagement on energy issues.

​When we talk about ‘The Future of Energy Security’, OPEC has always recognized market stability as a cornerstone. Today’s picture is completely different to when we convened in September 2016 in Algiers at the last IEF Ministerial Meeting.

​In the contemporary history of oil, it was probably the most downcast moment. The ship was drifting without a compass, threatening not only the fate of this noble industry that has fueled current unparalleled global prosperity, but putting the future of oil as an energy source of choice at great risk.

​Prices were in a free fall since mid-2014. The world’s oil supply massively outpaced demand. Economies were depressed and industry jobs were being shed. Investments were cut or frozen. OECD commercial stock levels had swelled to a record high of 400 mb in February 2016. The market was at 0!

​Something had to be done, and done urgently, hence OPEC decided to take the lead and return to the driver’s seat. Cooperation is the cornerstone of this newly budding leaf of life, and the main tool used to achieve the organization’s renewed commitment to jointly rescue the industry and restore sustainable market stability.

​The historic Declaration of Cooperation between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries signed on 10th December 2016 has shown what the determined efforts of a group of nations can bring. At the third joint meeting on 30th November of 2017 the Declaration of Cooperation was amended to continue throughout 2018.

​Today we can say that the rebalancing process is well underway, with strong conformity throughout 2017 - averaging 109% – turning market pessimism into optimism. In February 2018, conformity reached a record 138%. In March, we are heading to another record level of conformity.

​The overhang in OECD commercial oil stocks has shrunk to below 44 mb, investment is gradually inching back, and world economies are continuing to fire on all cylinders!

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​It took all of us together to bring the oil market out of the wilderness, and we need to take these lessons into the future. The equally important second phase of our efforts includes institutionalization of this cooperative process into a broader framework and ensuring continuity. This also means creating an enabling environment for adequate and timely investment, not only to maintain current production levels and replace natural decline, but also to satisfy future oil demand.

​In addition, OPEC Member Countries recognize sustainable development and alleviation of energy poverty as universal aspirations. OPEC is also fully engaged in and supportive of the Paris Agreement, which has been signed by all and ratified by most Member Countries. We believe in an all-inclusive approach, hence our decision to actively work on a global consensus.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The global energy system is undergoing significant and speedy changes and becoming progressively complex. Our economies are increasingly interwoven. We must build on our common ground to face upcoming challenges together, strive for sustainable market stability and safeguard future energy security through our ongoing effective cooperation. The irreversible forces of globalization will continue to shape this energy transition.

​We have, through the Declaration of Cooperation, which has become a permanent feature on the global energy scene, established a new framework for producing countries, taking into account the strategic interests of consumer countries as well as the world economy.

​Thank-you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/138-11-april-2018.html"
"2018-04-10","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues and friends,

​It is an absolute pleasure and distinct privilege for me to represent OPEC and participate at this meeting of the Heads of JODI partner organizations.

​I look across a room filled with the finest minds and foremost personalities in the global energy industry. To be in the company of a group of leaders who are global visionaries; who demonstrate such statesmanship and diplomatic skill on a daily basis; guiding their Organizations in such commendable ways; it is truly a great honour.

​Allow me to commend the leaders of the JODI community, for their foresight and the inspiration they provide for all of us working in our great industry, as well as their contribution to making our Initiative the success that it is. I am proud to have you as colleagues and I am prouder still, to call you friends.

​What is particularly heartening about this group of visionary leaders is that they are united in their unwavering commitment to achieving a sustainable oil market stability which is in the interests of producers and consumers alike, with positive repercussions for the global economy. This core conviction lies at the heart of JODI.

​And we collectively agree that the most effective antidotes for combatting market volatility are transparency, international dialogue and the exchange of reliable oil data.

​For these reasons, OPEC is extremely proud to have played a role in the establishment of JODI and the Initiative continues to have our full support. JODI remains one of the most visible manifestations of the producer-consumer dialogue and continues to make an immense contribution to sharing data and information in an efficient manner. We are wholeheartedly committed to enhancing dialogue among all energy stakeholders and harmonizing global energy statistics.

​Our Organization is also supportive of JODI because an integral aspect of OPEC’s ethos is the belief that the most effective means of addressing global challenges is through global stakeholders working together in a collaborative spirit.

​No problem was ever overcome by working in silos, rather it is only by intensifying cooperation, reaching out to new partners and never slackening in our resolve that we can achieve a better tomorrow.

​The historic “Declaration of Cooperation” between OPEC and its non-OPEC partners is a great vindication of this approach. As a result of the collective efforts and self-sacrifice of these 24 participating countries working in sync, the oil market is in a much healthier state today than it was 16 months ago.

​Furthermore, on a daily basis, OPEC, working together with its non-OPEC partners, continues to strengthen and refine the mechanisms for further institutionalizing this cooperation. This has heralded a new dawn in our industry and reaffirmed the fundamental importance of international teamwork and transparency in addressing the challenges of our time.

​Therefore it will be no surprise to any of you that OPEC is a passionate advocate for the type of international cooperation which is central to JODI.

​The JODI community continues to demonstrate that the global oil transparency challenge can, step-by-step, be effectively surmounted. Additionally, we recognize the value of improvements being sought to address limitations to the extent of the JODI oil and JODI gas databases.

​In addition to the oil and gas database enhancements, we hope that other major commodities, such as coal and LNG can be addressed in the near future within the JODI framework.

​I would like to conclude by reaffirming OPEC’s strong support for JODI. Strengthening cooperation between energy stakeholders remains an utmost priority for our Organization. After all, we are all on the same boat. And if I may stretch the boat analogy a little further, I’d like to recall the words of the American poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson:

​No member of a crew is praised for the rugged individuality of his rowing.

​Thank you for your kind attention and I wish us fruitful discussions.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/139-10-april-2018.html"
"2018-04-04","​Friends, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

​It gives me great pleasure to welcome the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Dr. Fatih Birol, and members of his delegation to the OPEC Secretariat.

​Today’s visit has both personal and professional importance to both our organizations. This is true not only in terms of ‘inter-agency’ relationships. It is also true in terms of the world economy and what some have called international ‘energy diplomacy’.

​There can be no doubt that the importance of our organizations has grown over the years. Whether through a growth in membership or an increase in the quality and quantity of their analytical work, the IEA and OPEC have both acquired greater prominence in global energy matters.

​The close relationship that has developed between the IEA and OPEC is also note-worthy. Today, each organization is working closely on almost every front that pertains to the energy industry, and both have taken a positive stance during the recent downturn.

​In short, whether it is under the ‘umbrella’ of the International Energy Forum (IEF), or through coordinated joint research activities, ‘collaboration’ and ‘complementarity’ between our two organizations have become the watchwords of the day.

​A demonstration of this can be seen in the extensive collaboration that we pursue through the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI), in which both the IEA and OPEC play a critical role. The ongoing efforts to improve the access to and the quality of energy data has brought our two organizations together – along with many other energy stakeholders.

​There is also the collaborative work our organizations do in the context of the Group of 20 (G-20). Through this forum, we have arrived at important decisions and have undertaken valuable joint studies, which have provided important inputs into our respective work.

​Bilaterally, too, we have made significant progress. Our two organizations have become increasingly complementary to each other. More importantly, the ‘boundaries’ and divergences of opinion that existed between our organizations have faded. This is especially apparent when we compare where we are today with where we were just some years ago.

​In short, regardless of the event, venue or opportunity, the close cooperation achieved over the past couple of years by the IEA and OPEC has been enriching, rewarding and broadly recognized.

​I would also like to underscore the faith that the IEA’s Executive Director and I have in each other’s organization and at a personal level.

​I have known Fatih since his early years when he was at the OPEC Secretariat. Over the years, he has grown to be a very close friend of mine – and today we are in continuous contact with each other in various capacities.

​When I took the reins of OPEC in August 2016, one of my very first visits was to his office at the IEA’s headquarters in Paris. He was gracious and hospitable. It was a reminder that the most successful professional relationships are built on the basis of friendship.

​It was Claude Mandil (former Executive Secretary of the IEA) who said to me in Paris, after my visit to your office – ‘Congratulations to you and Fatih for breaking down the Berlin Wall that kept OPEC and the IEA apart for too long’.

​Today, we reciprocate that hospitality. I am thus honoured to warmly welcome him and his team to the OPEC Secretariat. As both a colleague and friend, this is truly a sort of ‘homecoming’ for him – a reuniting of former members of the OPEC family.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Through our respective organizations, Fatih and I have shared many platforms. We have been together for high-level policy discussions and have served together on various panels. Whether at the World Energy Council or the World Petroleum Congress, we have had numerous opportunities to exchange outlooks, share insights and break bread together.

​We have also been together at world renowned platforms, participating in special sessions at events such as CERAWeek in Houston, the Oil & Money Conference in London and the World Economic Forum in Davos.

​In fact, our discussions and exchanges on the market and the industry have been much commended. Dialogue and discussions between the IEA and OPEC are increasingly considered an essential part of the various international gatherings in which we participate. Conference organizers now regularly ask us to appear together on the same panel – and we play off each other well.

​At the same time, we continue to pursue close relationships between our organizations at different levels – not just at the executive level. Our technical experts, research specialists and statisticians often come together at specialized gatherings and technical meetings.

​Just a few weeks ago, we held the Sixth Joint IEA-IEF-OPEC Workshop on the Interactions between Physical and Financial Energy Markets here in Vienna. This Workshop was immediately followed by a specialized technical meeting, held here at the Secretariat.

​These were both exemplary affairs. But we have a lot more that we can do together – and there is a lot more to achieve in the coming years.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​We are proud that the relations between our two great organizations have strengthened over the years. Both the IEA and OPEC have been enriched and stimulated through an increase in the extent and quality of our contacts, content and cooperation.

​For today, we have much ground to cover. Today’s programme shall give us an opportunity to look further into many areas of common interest, as well as areas of possible collaboration. These potential ‘avenues of cooperation’ hold great promise – not only to address the common challenges that we face together but to deepen our institutional ties even further.

​Fatih, I welcome you back to one of your starting places – your old ‘home’. I thank you for your friendship and close cooperation. The dialogue between our organizations is something to be proud of. It forms part of an ‘enhanced momentum’ that we have seen in recent years – which will further strengthen our cooperation, now and into the future.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/140-4-april-2018.html"
"2018-02-19","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is an absolute privilege for me to address this inaugural edition of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS). As a proud Nigerian, I am delighted to be back in my home country. Thank you to His Excellency Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, for the kind invitation to speak at this history-making event.

It feels particularly timely to be in Nigeria this week. Wednesday is the UN recognized International Mother Language Day, which offers an opportunity to celebrate Nigeria’s unique multilingual heritage! The magnificent diversity and glorious splendor of our great country’s rich culture, means I can think of no better place to be on this occasion.

There is always something thrilling about being part of innovation; and this Summit is truly innovative. I have no doubt that as it evolves into the premier platform for shaping petroleum policies in Africa; years from now, we will all take pride in saying we were at the first edition!

I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to our esteemed President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari. Not only has the President devoted himself unwaveringly to serving our country and offered such inspirational leadership, he has proven himself repeatedly as an able and gifted statesman on the international scene. In doing so, he has enhanced Nigeria’s prestige in the community of nations. The gravitas with which President Buhari discharges his duties, elevates the dignity of the office of the Presidency. The President is truly a credit to our country and we thank Boss Gidahyelda Mustpha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, who ably represented the President today.

President Buhari demonstrated his diplomatic skills when he played an instrumental role in securing the adoption of the historic Declaration of Cooperation. On behalf of the entire OPEC family, I would like to express our deep appreciation for his open and cooperative stance, his willingness to use his good offices, international respect and admiration to intervene at a head of state level, and for his flexibility in reaching a consensus solution.

Nigeria is consistently regarded as one of the most admired and respected members of OPEC, particularly in the realm of consensus-building. Our President has made a momentous contribution to making this the case.

Nigeria is also blessed in benefiting from the incredible repertoire of skills possessed by our able and sagacious Minister Kachikwu. The Minister has been a lynchpin for the success which OPEC has enjoyed over the last few years since I assumed office. His talent, wisdom and industriousness have made him an asset to our country and to the OPEC and non-OPEC strategic partnership.

Convening this summit at this particularly timely moment for our industry is also testimony to the Minister’s insight and judgement. We have just come out of one of the worst downturns in the history of oil. As we collectively endeavor to move forward, it is very appropriate to step back, take stock and draw lessons from this difficult chapter. This Conference offers us a worthy platform to do exactly that, and ensure we work towards confining extreme market volatility to the past. I pay tribute to the Minister for his impeccable timing in seizing this moment.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Innovation, such as the organization of this summit, is the life-blood of our industry. Over the last 20 months, OPEC has embarked on one of the most innovative enterprises ever known in the history of oil: the Declaration of Cooperation.

This innovation was a response to an unprecedented market turbulence which had a devastating effect on our industry.

We should note at this point, that price cycles are not new in the history of oil: indeed, in its research on price cycles, OPEC has identified six since the early 1970s.

However, this current price cycle should be considered unique for several reasons. Firstly, it is the most overwhelmingly supply-driven of all the cycles we assessed in this exercise. Secondly, the magnitude of the price drop is the highest in real terms. Thirdly, the recent oil price drop has been considerably sharper than the decline in prices for other commodities, which is in stark contrast to the oil price collapse of 1985-1986, when all commodity prices declined in a similarly steep manner. And finally, the downward cycle had equally negative ramifications for consumer countries in the OECD. The multiplier effects of this cycle were reflected in the deflationary pressures experienced by these countries.

From 2014 to 2016, world oil supply growth outpaced that of oil demand, with world oil supply growing by 5.5 mb/d, while world oil demand increased by 4.1 mb/d.

By July 2016, OECD commercial stock levels reached a record high of about 386 mb over the five-year average. The OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016. Investments were choked-off, with exploration and production spending falling by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016. Additionally, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued, and many thousands of high quality jobs were lost. A record number of companies in our industry filed for bankruptcy.

Our industry was on life-support and a medical breakthrough was necessary to revive it. Thankfully, a breakthrough came in the form of the historic Declaration of Cooperation, which the Minister played a key role in securing the adoption of. This landmark decision was the culmination of the extensive consultations undertaken throughout 2016, which aimed to build consensus about the strategic urgency of rebalancing the global oil market in a collective manner.

Twenty-four oil producing nations agreed at the first OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting held on the 10th of December 2016 in Vienna, on a concerted effort to accelerate the stabilization of the global oil market through voluntary adjustments in total production of around 1.8 million barrels per day. The second OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, held on the 25th of May 2017, extended the voluntary production adjustments for another nine months commencing on the 1st of July 2017.

Following the third OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 30th of November 2017, the Declaration of Cooperation was amended to take effect for the entirety of 2018.

If one word was used to describe the impact of the Declaration of Cooperation, it would be ‘transformative.’ A new player has emerged on the global oil scene: the OPEC-non-OPEC strategic partnership; conformity has been at a record-breaking high and the market rebalancing process has gained massive momentum. Not bad for a partnership which many cynics did not think would get off the ground in the first-place!

Conformity averaged 107% per month in 2017, across all participating countries. I am pleased to announce that January’s conformity level will be released in a few hours, which will be 133% in January 2018.

While commercial oil stocks in the OECD rose in January 2018, this is typical for the season and they remained 74 mb above the latest five-year average. This represents an astonishing reduction of over 265 million barrels since January 2017, when we started implementing the production adjustments.

There are further positive signs for the global oil market. Global economic growth is forecast at 3.8% for both 2017 and 2018. Indeed the IMF reported in Davos at the World Economic Forum that 122 countries around the globe have registered positive economic performances. Correspondingly, global oil demand growth has also been on the rise; with the 2017 forecast having been revised up to now stand at 1.6 million barrels a day. For 2018, the encouraging dynamic is set to continue with a forecast of 1.6 million barrels a day. Additionally, all three benchmarks- Brent, WTI and Dubai- remain in backwardation.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Despite these momentous achievements it would be extremely reductive to suggest that the Declaration of Cooperation is only about the voluntary adjustments in production. Undoubtedly, they have been indispensable for returning a degree of stability to the oil market.

However, the adjustments are only the ‘tip of the iceberg’ of what the Declaration of Cooperation truly is.

This historic agreement is an assertion of certain principles: namely, that we are always stronger together; that there are limits to what can be achieved working alone in silos, but there are limitless possibilities to what can be accomplished by working together. When these 24 participating countries join in concerted action, united by the common principles of equity, transparency and fairness, they can meet any challenge.

The Declaration of Cooperation is also an invitation: an open invitation to all stakeholders in the energy community to join us and contribute their ideas, their know-how to achieving a sustainably stable oil market in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy.

This truly is a partnership which is broad and inclusive, as demonstrated by six additional countries issuing a ‘Declaration of Support,’ at the third OPEC- Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in November last year, which recognized and acclaimed this contribution to oil market stability.

Testament to the Declaration of Cooperation’s durability is the fact that on a daily basis, OPEC and non-OPEC partners develop ways of institutionalizing our collaboration:

I am delighted by Nigeria’s determination to contribute to the Declaration of Cooperation partnership’s successes. President Buhari recently reaffirmed this in a speech presenting the National Budget for 2018 to the National Assembly in November:

“We shall continue our positive engagement with other oil producing countries to ensure that the momentum generated is sustained.”

With Nigeria playing this role, I am certain these words will be fulfilled.

Market stability is critical because oil will continue to play an integral role in the future energy mix. This is a key-takeaway from the most recent edition of OPEC’s flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook, launched in November.

The 2017 WOO provides a comprehensive analysis of what lies ahead for the global oil industry until 2040.

Oil is expected to remain the fuel with the largest share in the energy mix throughout the forecast period. Oil and gas together are still expected to provide more than half of the world's energy needs from 2016 to 2040, with their combined share relatively stable between 52–53%.

Primary global energy demand is expected to increase by 35% in the reported period. Correspondingly, long-term oil demand is expected to increase by 15 mb/d, rising from 94.5 mb/d in 2016 to 111.1 mb/d in 2040. The majority of this rising demand will come from developing countries, increasing by almost 24 mb/d, to reach 67 mb/d by 2040. Significantly, this means there is no expectation for a peak in oil demand over the forecast period to 2040. World consumption is on course to exceed 100mb/d, much earlier than projected.

It is also important to note that to meet the projected increase in global oil demand, investments worth an estimated $10.5 trillion will be required. This underscores the absolute necessity of a sustainable and stable oil market, conducive to encouraging the type of long-cycle investments necessary to prevent supply gaps in the future.

Oil is an essential building block for economic growth, especially in developing countries. Throughout its history, our resource has stimulated development, prosperity and social mobility. Indeed, oil has played a pivotal role in lifting millions of people out of poverty. Put simply, oil has fueled our civilization.

The Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, adopted at the historic summit of the UN in September 2015, to which our President made an important contribution, has enormous implications for our industry. I believe oil can make a constructive contribution to the achievement of many of the Goals and targets within the Agenda, in particular:

Oil’s poverty-eradicating potential should not be unduly shackled. The right to have access to modern energy services for the first time, to provide warmth, light and mobility should not be overly impeded.

OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement. We firmly believe that a global consensus from the multilateral process remains the best and most inclusive way for all nations to collectively counter climate change in a fair and equitable manner.

The world will continue to need all energy sources, especially for the 1.1 billion people in developing countries that have no access to electricity and the 2.3 billion deprived of commercial energy.

Therefore, rather than discriminate against any energy source, it is vital that we collectively develop and adopt technologies, as well as all-inclusive energy policies, that transform the environmental credentials of all energies, including the 1.5 trillion barrels of proven reserves which currently exist.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We are emerging from a dark and painful chapter for our industry; however, with the Declaration of Cooperation providing an anchor of stability, a new page is being written, one which has the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy at its heart.

With the OPEC-non-OPEC strategic partnership fulfilling its responsibilities and Nigeria playing a leadership role, one cannot help but brim with confidence that working together; we can achieve a better tomorrow.

God bless you and may He always bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/141-19-february-2018.html"
"2018-02-14","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is a great pleasure to be here in Riyadh for this eighth edition of the IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.

​Allow me first to acknowledge with sincerest gratitude His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud. I would like to thank him and Saudi Arabia’s esteemed delegation to OPEC for their ongoing leadership, and the pivotal role they continue to play within our Organization.

​Saudi Arabia’s leadership role has never been more evident than during the last year, when it assumed the Conference Presidency in 2017 and helped author a new chapter in the history of the international oil industry.

​Indeed, we witnessed the dawning of a new age of collaboration, as 24 OPEC and non-OPEC participating producers voluntarily made significant progress in advancing the mandate of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, bringing us, step-by-step, closer to our common goal of the return of a balanced, stable and healthy oil market in the interest of the global economy.

​Our success last year would not have been possible without the extraordinary efforts and dedicated leadership of HE Khalid Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources.

​In his capacity as President, he was instrumental in ensuring that these noble efforts remained on track throughout the year. His vast industry experience and wisdom were extremely effective during the many high-level meetings and shuttle diplomacy he conducted on behalf of this process.

​The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ will continue to benefit from his expertise and vision in the months ahead, with HE Al-Falih now serving as Chairman of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, the JMMC, in 2018.

​I am also extremely pleased to see HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation here today. In his role as Alternate Chairman of the JMMC, and the driving force behind non-OPEC participation, HE Novak has been a leading light to the success of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​HE Al-Falih and HE Novak are our apostles to the value of cooperation. They have proven to be the key strong pillars on which the historic OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation has been built.

​There is no doubt that the participation of these two great industry icons today will lift the Symposium to another enviable level. In this regard, may I congratulate the IEF and our chief host – my twin brother – HE Sun Xiansheng, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum. His energy, commitment and positivity towards the work of the IEF, as well as his promotion and advocacy of its values, are evident to all. In a very short span of time, you have transformed the face of the IEF.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​May I invite you, Excellencies and distinguished delegates, to cast your mind back to the 7th Symposium held in February of last year.

​At that point in time, we were only just over a month into the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ and there was still much scepticism surrounding the efforts of participating countries, in terms of bringing down the OECD stock overhang and helping return a sustainable stability to the market.

​Stock levels were not showing signs of trending lower, and the key benchmarks remained in contango.

​Slowly, but surely, however, the market began to turn around throughout 2017.

​The market has now rediscovered its optimism and confidence – others have even remarked that it has finally found its compass.

​In December 2017, the 24 participating countries achieved an extraordinary conformity level of 129%, the highest since the start of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. Monthly levels rose steadily throughout last year, from 87% in January to December’s record level, with an overall yearly average of 107%. The preliminary data for January seems to point to another record-breaking level of conformity.

​The signs of improved market stability and momentum are, in turn, providing much needed support to the global economy and providing a spur to much needed industry investment.

​Moreover, throughout 2017 we saw the global economic recovery gather momentum, with expected economic growth for the year improving from an estimated 3.2% at last year’s Symposium to 3.8% today. This positive trend is expected to be maintained in 2018, with growth also estimated at 3.8%.

​Correspondingly, global oil demand growth also picked up during the year, rising from an estimated 1.3 mb/d at last year’s Symposium for 2017, to the present level of 1.6 mb/d. The same healthy level is expected in 2018.

​I should stress here that we will continue to look through the dynamics of markets such as that which we experienced last week. The solid overall market fundamentals remain as strong as the rock of Gibraltar.

​The JMMC, under the able leadership of HE Al-Falih, and Co-Chair, HE Alexander Novak, along with the full support of the OPEC Secretariat, will keep its focus on our key objectives. It will continue to work hard to build upon the success of 2017.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:

​Much of the world’s focus of late has been on the developments related to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ and its short-term market dynamics. But, let us not forget the importance of maintaining a longer-term perspective.

​Indeed, our industry is inherently a long-cycle industry that depends on massive long-term investments in research, development, exploration and production to ensure its future, and to be a dependable and reliable supplier of oil to consumers across the globe.

​Today, we will have an opportunity, as in previous editions of this Symposium, to do just that. We will hear from a wide spectrum of views on the future energy outlook, across all timeframes.

​OPEC’s longer-term outlooks are based on research that was published in the 2017 edition of the World Oil Outlook, which, for more than a decade now, has been providing in-depth analysis of the major industry trends and dynamics, while offering keen insights into the challenges and uncertainties facing our industry.

​In addition, I am pleased to see that a portion of today’s agenda, namely in Session 3, is being devoted to the crucial issue of investment in both conventional and unconventional oil and gas production, a topic featured prominently in the WOO 2017.

​This was an issue at the top of the agenda of the Egypt Petroleum Show in Cairo where I spoke on Monday. We heard from both NOCs and IOCs about the crucial need to reinstate adequate levels of long-term investment to the industry.

​The market downturn that occurred in mid-2014 put a severe dent in industry budgets, with exploration and production spending falling by a massive 27% in both 2015 and 2016. Overall, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued.

​Although investments are expected to pick up slightly this year, we are still not at the levels we have seen in the past. In addition, we continue to see more short-cycle rather than long-cycle projects, which are vital to future industry growth.

​It is also important to remember that this is not only about boosting new production. Oil producers will need to account for natural decline rates, with a general industry consensus of around 5% per year. Thus, in order to maintain current production levels, the industry could be required to add more than 4 mb/d each year.

​With this in mind, let us be clear that the foundation for investment and growth will only come through a lasting stability in the market. And that is why the ongoing efforts of the 24 participating nations of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ are so key to the future of our industry. There is a direct link between long-term security of supply and short-term conditions.

​Excellencies and distinguished delegates,

​Today’s Symposium is a further bridge to enhancing a common understanding between the IEF, the IEA and OPEC.

​It is also just one aspect of OPEC’s ongoing efforts in international dialogue and cooperation. We conduct annual bilateral and multilateral energy dialogues with a wide range of international stakeholders, including the European Union, Russia, China, India, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the G20 and international oil companies. We have also recently held fruitful meetings with various stakeholders in the US.

​These proactive efforts are a priority for OPEC, because, in today’s increasingly complex and interdependent world as well as an interlinked global oil market, no one player can go it alone – cooperation and dialogue are more crucial than ever before to meet with success.

​Looking ahead, I believe there is great potential in expanding these collaborative efforts and instituting them as longer-term platforms for cooperation. This would help us to enrich our processes for data collection and the sharing of outlooks.

​More generally, through open and transparent communication, we can help foster a more sustainable stability in the global oil market, and all industry stakeholders will stand to benefit.

​I look forward to robust and productive deliberations today.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/142-14-february-2018.html"
"2018-02-12","​Mr President, Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is a distinct honour, and indeed a great pleasure for me to be here today to deliver this keynote address on the occasion of such an important event as the Egypt Petroleum Show, held under the patronage of His Excellency Abdel Fattah El Sisi, President of Egypt.

​On a personal note, I would like to pay my deep respects to the indefatigable President Abdel Fattah El Sisi. His leadership of Egypt, his great guidance and his vision for the country’s future should be widely acclaimed.

​Today, is also an opportunity to thank the President and His Excellency Tarek El Molla, Egypt’s Minister of Petroleum & Mineral Resources for the country’s welcome attendance, engagement and solidarity as an observer at the 173rd Meeting of the OPEC Conference and active participation at the 3rd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in Vienna on 30 November last year.

​I should note here that Egypt has a long history of cooperation with OPEC. I recall that Cairo hosted the First Arab Petroleum Congress in April 1959, and helped set the path towards the establishment of OPEC.

​On the last day of that Congress, a number of visionary leaders, namely Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo of Venezuela, Abdullah al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia, Dr Fuad Rouhani of Iran, Dr Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq, and Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait, slipped off one by one to meet secretly at the Cairo Yacht Club here in Maadi.

​These five founding fathers of OPEC, forged what has become known as a ‘gentlemen's agreement’ in Cairo. It was here where the idea of OPEC was incubated, before it came into the world in Baghdad in September 1960.

​Egypt was also a pioneer non-OPEC producer in terms of its cooperation with OPEC. The country has shown great foresight in reaching out to others. It was one of the first observers to the OPEC Conference back in 1984; it contributed to oil market stabilization efforts in the late 1980s; and, this historic city hosted OPEC ministerial level meetings in the 2000s.

​Today, Egypt is also fast becoming a key regional hub for energy and a global player in the industry. Over the last few years it has made great strides in discovering and developing its energy resources, under the able and far-sighted leadership of its President.

​This is particularly true in natural gas, with fields such as Zohr, North Alexandria and Nooros, which are expected to make Egypt self-sufficient in natural gas, but also in oil, with new fields being developed in the country.

​Egypt’s presence at the landmark meetings of 30 November 2017, alongside a further five additional non-OPEC producing countries should be highly commended.

​It meant that at these meetings, 30 oil producers, with 24 producers already part of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, affirmed their commitment to restoring stability to the oil market on a sustainable basis, in the interests of producers, consumers, and the global economy.

​To put it simply: it is unparalleled in the history of the oil industry.

​When researching my speech for today, I came across a number of Egyptian sayings or proverbs that were carved on temples and tomb walls thousands of years ago. One of these read: “The seed cannot sprout upwards without simultaneously sending roots into the ground.”

​It is very apt for the historic cooperation that we have witnessed between OPEC and non-OPEC through the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. The roots of this cooperation are the foundation on which the success has been built, and it will remain fundamental to it flowering further in the years ahead as we look to institutionalize the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, beyond rebalancing the market.

​We need to remember that the strength of the team is each individual member. And the strength of each member is the team.

​It is why the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ remains open to all producers. We believe it is a continuity partnership that can work for everyone, across all timeframes, to help deliver the sustainable market stability we all desire.

​Mr President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​In looking at the current oil market situation, there is no doubt that the industry is starting to feel a warmer glow.

​The overall market fundamentals are strong.

​In 2017, the global economic recovery gathered momentum. This positive trend is expected to be maintained in 2018 with an extremely healthy growth forecast of 3.8%.

​Correspondingly, global oil demand growth has been robust and strengthening. It is expected to grow by 1.6 mb/d in 2018, the same level as in 2017. We now also see global oil demand surpassing the 100 mb/d threshold much earlier than we previously expected.

​In addition, the OECD stocks overhang has fallen from around 340 million barrels (mb) against the five-year average at the start of 2017, to a currently reported level of just above 100 mb.

​And also significantly, the three benchmark crudes of Brent, WTI and Dubai remain in backwardation.

​This rebalancing has evidently been driven by the unprecedented conformity levels of participating OPEC and non-OPEC countries in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​The monthly average conformity level for the first year was a remarkable 107% for the voluntary production adjustments. Moreover, it hit a record conformity level of 129% in December 2017.

​We have gone beyond what was originally envisaged. The results speak for themselves. And we continue to have the same focus and commitment as we head into 2018.

​We will not be complacent, and we will stay the course in helping bring stocks down to normal levels.

​Mr President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The world will need more energy in the years ahead.

​In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2017 published last November, energy demand is set to increase by a huge 35% in the period to 2040.

​Moreover, oil and gas will continue to play a major role in the world’s energy mix for the foreseeable future, contributing an estimated 52% of the global energy mix by 2040.

​This will obviously require huge investments, such as those being made by Egypt over the past few years, as well as by OPEC Member Countries who have continued to invest in their industries throughout this recent volatile down-cycle. This has positioned them well to maintain their leading roles as reliable and dependable suppliers to expanding economies around the world.

​However, it is important to remember that globally more than a trillion dollars of capex cuts have been witnessed in recent years, with upstream E&P investments falling by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016.

​It is essential to recall that the foundation for investment and growth comes through balance and stability in the oil market. Stability today begets stability tomorrow. We need to remember that the short-, medium- and long-terms are inter-linked in multiple ways.

​That is why the success of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has proven to be so important to the strong fundamentals of the global oil market today.

​Looking ahead, I firmly believe that the future of our industry will be built on cooperation. And let me say that I also firmly believe that the best for our industry is yet to come.

​From OPEC’s perspective, together with our friends from non-OPEC we turned an historic page in December 2016 through the formation of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, and today we are helping write a new chapter in the book focused on sustainable stability in the global oil industry.

​Let me add that here that the book is not finished. In fact, it has only just begun. We expect to write many more chapters in the years ahead.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/143-12-february-2018.html"
"2018-01-21","Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

I would like to add my support to the wise and eloquent words of their Excellencies and add a few of my own.

On behalf of all of the staff at the OPEC Secretariat, I would like to express our deep appreciation to our Omani friends, for the gracious hospitality. The arrangements for today’s meeting have been truly outstanding. Thank you to the entire Omani team.

To His Excellency Khalid A. Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, may I wish you every success in assuming this new role as Chairman of this committee. Given the outstanding job you did as President of the Conference, I am sure you will lead the JMMC to further glories in 2018. The Minister gave his country’s full support to our efforts and this played a crucial role in our unprecedented success.

I would like to pay tribute to your predecessor, HE Issam A. Almarzooq, Kuwait's Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity and Water, who skilfully guided this Committee to the best first year we could possibly have hoped for. Let me bid a warm welcome to Kuwait’s new Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity and Water, HE Bakheet S. Al-Rashidi, who will be a great asset to the JMMC team and will continue in the finest tradition of our Kuwaiti friends. We have already been assured by no less a person than His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait, whom I had the honour of an audience with a few days ago, and he reassured me of Kuwait’s continued commitment to our joint efforts and encouraged us to stay the course.

To the new President of the Conference, HE Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Industry, of the UAE, may I also join the Chairman and wish you every success in your new role. We could not hope for a better team.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

As I mentioned last night at our sumptuous dinner, to be in Oman, is to be among friends. Today, we meet not only to convene the JMMC, but also to celebrate friendship. Friendship has been the underreported, secret ingredient that transformed the Declaration of Cooperation into a breath-taking, unprecedented success. When professional relationships such as ours, evolve into friendships, united behind a common purpose, together, we can move mountains.

As we gather in the magnificent city of Muscat, it is only right that we pay tribute to the enduring bonds of friendship between OPEC and Oman.

Oman has been the very definition of ‘an all-weather friend,’ attending OPEC Ministerial Conferences as an observer for over thirty years, and supporting OPEC and non-OPEC technical meetings since their inception.

The greatest highlights in Omani-OPEC relations have occurred in the last 20 years. This is no mere coincidence. This is because of a very special gentleman, someone who we are honoured to call our friend- His Excellency, Dr. Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Rumhy, Minister of Oil and Gas of this great country.

From the bottom of my heart, I thank the Minister for his courage, commitment, inspirational example, and, above all, his friendship. When I reflect on the many years that we have known each other, I am reminded of the words of the great Irish poet, W.B. Yeats:

Think where man’s glory most begins and ends;
And say my glory was I had such friends.

Thank you and I wish us fruitful discussions.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/144-21-january-2018.html"
"2018-01-21","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning.

​First, let me say it’s good to be in Oman. I always look forward to my visits to Oman, and this occasion is no different! I would like to thank His Excellency Mohammed Bin Hamad Al-Rumhi for hosting us with such exquisite hospitality. I am particularly grateful for the efforts that the Minister and all of his compatriots have made to ensure smooth and efficient proceedings at this gathering.

​Let me also emphasize how serious I am about beginning my term as Chair of this important committee, whose work has been crucial to achieving the market stability we see today. In my brief remarks, I would like to discuss the role of the JMMC, the progress made since the establishment of this Committee, but more importantly to look ahead to what needs to be accomplished in 2018 in order to realize our important objectives.

​It is particularly welcome to be holding this discussion in Oman, not just because of the wonderful setting, but also because Oman, with the stewardship of His Excellency Minister Al-Rumhi, led the way in achieving and exceeding full compliance with the Declaration of Cooperation.

​It is this conformity which was the bedrock of our success as a group in 2017, and I intend to dedicate my energy over the coming year to maintain or even succeed that performance in 2018.

​I clearly see that while the Declaration of Cooperation has established the requisite structure and foundation for the market stability we seek, the JMMC has provided a credible mechanism, which has facilitated the restoration of market balance.

​As you know, when we started this journey more than a year ago, we faced severe challenges in transforming market sentiment from deeply negative to positive, and restoring confidence in our ability to bring stability to the market. At the time, concerns were expressed that similar frameworks had unraveled in the past.

​During the first half of 2017 we faced considerable challenges in bringing down inventories due to structural and seasonal factors. But by now, from an overhang in the market of around 340 million barrels of oil we have eliminated more than 220 million barrels, while between June and December last year, floating storage dropped by nearly 50 million barrels. As a result, we are moving ever closer towards a balanced market.

​Likewise, levels of conformity have been extraordinary, averaging above 100%.

​Clearly, our work is achieving the desired effect, and there is widespread recognition of those successes. Results speak for themselves.

​Improved market stability and strength is apparent, which is underpinning more broadly an improving global economy as well as resulting in a return of investment flows into future supply, crucial for not only meeting growth in oil demand but also offsetting natural declines in several producing regions.

​And we as major producers have held together despite numerous challenges.

​The success achieved in the past year can be put down in no small part to the remarkable work of this committee.

​Building on the vital work of the Joint Technical Committee, the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee has provided the essential leadership, monitoring framework and signaling to the market of our determination to succeed.

​And I would like to pay particular tribute to the co-chairs of the committee in 2017, His Excellency Essam al-Marzouq, the then-Minister of Oil and Electricity of Kuwait, and His Excellency Alexander Novak, the Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. Their exemplary work set us on the right course, and I am particularly pleased that my partner His Excellency Alexander Novak will remain as a co-Chair in the year ahead.

​I also welcome His Excellency Bakheet Al-Rashidi, the new Kuwaiti Oil Minister. The State of Kuwait’s contributions to this Committee, to the Joint Technical Committee, and to the larger cooperative effort surely will continue to be valuable.

​While highlighting and acknowledging our achievements to-date, let me stress that we cannot and will not let our success in 2017 make us complacent.

​There remains a lot of hard work ahead of us.

​And we must continue focusing our efforts on the ultimate goal of eliminating the remaining overhang and restoring full market balance.

​When it comes to the favorability of fundamentals, today we can check almost all boxes, be it healthy demand, falling inventories, or high conformance.

​However, it is a dynamic market and new challenges are certain to emerge. We must be ready to deal with the evolving situation.

​To my mind, the way to achieve these goals is through monitoring the market as closely as ever, working with our members to ensure full compliance with what has been agreed, responding to whatever needs to be done to maintain hard-won market stability, and by maintaining unity in our ranks.

​I also believe that, going forward, we will all benefit by further solidifying the JMMC platform, as we must look beyond the short and medium term to long-term stability in the market on a more sustainable basis. That is likely to require building on our current platforms and devising stronger mechanisms of data collection and ensuring their integrity and consistency for all participants.

​Once again, it’s a pleasure to be in Oman, and I am honored to chair the group this year and will look forward to working with you all to achieve our objectives, building on the excellent results achieved in 2017.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/145-21-january-2018.html"
"2017-12-13","I would like to begin by thanking my twin brother, Dr. Sun Xiansheng, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum. Not many people know that we are brothers, but Dr. Sun likes to remind me that there once was only one continent before they split up into our current continents. We all came from there, so this shared origin makes us brothers!

It is a pleasure to share the floor with my professor, Daniel Yergin. Dan has been a great friend over the years.

Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a distinct honour for me to deliver this keynote address at the International Energy Executive Forum, on its fifth anniversary.

We live in an increasingly interdependent world, driven by the irreversible forces of globalization which will continue to define the global energy transition. The OPEC-non-OPEC landmark, historic Declaration of Cooperation has established a platform to provide the necessary insurance of sustainable stability in the oil market with multiplier effects on the global economy.

Hence the theme of today’s forum, “Energy at Crossroads: Seeking New Balance” is both apt and timely.

Today’s agenda covers a programme of topics and discussion points that are extremely stimulating and thought-provoking.

In my comments, I would like to touch on subjects relevant to the short, medium and long term perspectives for the oil industry. The complex interplay between these components is crucial in order to truly assess “Energy at Crossroads.”

In this regard, my remarks can be divided into four sections:

Firstly, I would like to make a point about the general character of the oil industry, which will contextualize many of my subsequent remarks.

The second section relates to the market’s prospects in the short-term, and looming large in this respect is the historic Declaration of Cooperation. I will cover its genesis, impact and successes to date.

Thirdly, with regard to the medium to longer-term, I would like to provide a brief synopsis of the 2017 edition of OPEC’s World Oil Outlook to 2040 (WOO), which was launched last month. A delegation from OPEC headed by Dr. Ayed Al-Qahtani, Director of the Research Division, presented an overview of this to CNPC ETRI on Monday, here in Beijing.

And finally, I would like to shed some light on OPEC’s views on current discussions on policies aimed at combatting climate change.

In these sections, I would like to make eight points which I believe encapsulate OPEC’s views on current conditions in the oil market and perspectives for the future.

My eight points will be:

Ladies and gentlemen,

My first point is very much related to the topic of Session One, “Balancing the old and new in the world of energy.”

Undoubtedly there are major changes afoot in our industry. These have been brought about by a mixture of the emergence of new producers and technological innovation, as well as a new policy framework with regard to measures aimed at combatting climate change.

However, as anyone who has read Dan’s masterpiece “The Prize” is aware, in the long history of this industry, since Edwin Drake first struck oil in Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859, change has been a permanent characteristic of the story of oil.

Nowhere is the tendency for change more apparent than in the history of the oil price. Price cycles have always been part of the market and they always will be. They are integral to its evolving nature and their characteristics correlate with changes in market dynamics and structures.

During the course of our research on price cycles, OPEC has identified six since the early 1970s. This has been an illuminating exercise as it has revealed some interesting similarities among the cycles, as well as some discrepancies.

For example, there have been instances of demand driven cycles, whereas in other cases they have been supply driven. At other times, a combination of supply and demand factors has driven prices.

Moreover, it is apparent that in recent times, non-fundamental factors like speculative financial activities have also had a significant impact on prices.

However, this current price cycle should be considered unique for several reasons. Firstly, it is the most overwhelmingly supply-driven of all the cycles we assessed as part of this exercise. Secondly, the magnitude of the price drop is the highest in real terms. And finally, the recent oil price drop has been considerably sharper than the decline in prices for other commodities, which is in stark contrast to the oil price collapse of 1985-1986, when all commodity prices declined in a similar steep manner, something Dan referred to earlier.

Between 2008 and 2015, non-OPEC liquids supply growth was 7.9 mb/d, while OPEC liquids production was 1.5 mb/d during the same period. This total of 9.4 mb/d growth in a relatively short period, was phenomenal and epoch defining.

By July 2016, you may recall that OECD commercial stock levels reached a record high of about 386 mb over the five-year average. The OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016. Investments were choked-off, with exploration and production spending falling by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016. Additionally, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued, and many thousands of good quality jobs were lost.

The seriousness of these developments motivated OPEC to embark on extensive consultations throughout 2016 to build consensus about the strategic urgency of rebalancing the global oil market in a collective manner.

This culminated in the historic Declaration of Cooperation, whereby 24 oil producing nations agreed at the first OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting held on the 10th of December 2016 in Vienna, on a concerted effort to accelerate the stabilization of the global oil market through voluntary adjustments in total production of around 1.8 million barrels per day. The second OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, held on the 25th of May 2017, extended the voluntary production adjustments for another nine months commencing on the 1st of July 2017.

Two weeks ago, we saw the ultimate vindication that not only is this partnership holding together: it is thriving.

Following the third OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 30th of November 2017, the Declaration of Cooperation was amended to take effect for the whole year of 2018. Six additional countries issued a ‘Declaration of Support,’ recognising and acclaiming this contribution to oil market stability.

Currently, we are gradually but steadily putting the building blocks in place for institutionalising the Declaration of Cooperation, beyond rebalancing the market:

Therefore, the Declaration of Cooperation and the enhanced relations between its participating countries constitute a fundamental and essential feature of the “new in the world of energy.”

I am delighted to say that the consequences of our historic cooperation have exceeded even the most optimistic of predictions. The market rebalancing process is well underway. Commercial oil stocks in the OECD fell further in the month of November and the difference to the latest five-year average has been reduced by around 200 million barrels since the beginning of this year.

This process has clearly been driven by the excellent conformity levels with the production adjustments, which was 116% for October 2017. It is a clear indication of the steely and determined commitment of participating producers to this process.

There are further positive signs for the global oil market. Global economic growth, which Dan referred to earlier, is forecast at 3.7% for both 2017 and 2018. China’s GDP growth is forecast at 6.8% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2018. Correspondingly, global oil demand growth has also been on the rise, with the 2017 forecast having been revised up by nearly 400 tb/d since the beginning of the year to now stand at 1.53 million barrels a day. For 2018, the encouraging dynamic is set to continue with a forecast of 1.51 million barrels a day.

My remarks so far have been largely confined to the short-term prospects of the oil industry. I would now like to turn to the longer-term prospects.

Last month, OPEC launched the 2017 version of the WOO. This edition, like previous editions, underscored the importance of Asia, specifically China, as a major centre of economic growth, playing a pivotal role in the future of the energy industry. For example, China’s portion of global GDP is expected to increase from 18% to 23% between 2016 and 2040.

Global energy demand growth is expected to increase by approximately 96 million barrels of oil equivalent per day between 2016 and 2040. Roughly 23% of this increase will come from China.

A similar trend can be observed with regard to oil demand. World oil demand is expected to grow by 16 mb/d, from 94.4 mb/d in 2016 to 111.1 mb/d in 2040. Here also, China will account for a staggering 38% of this growth.

Furthermore, according to our estimates, crude exports from OPEC Member Countries to China will increase by close to 4 mb/d between 2016 and 2040, rising from 4.4 mb/d in 2016 to more than 8 mb/d in 2040, representing around 20 % of the world’s total crude oil trade between major regions by 2040.

So it is absolutely clear that for the foreseeable future, China will be one of the most important outlets for OPEC barrels and the Asia-Pacific region will be the backbone of the increase in energy and oil demand.

The importance of China for the future of world energy demand will be underlined by the progress of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As infrastructure expands along the BRI routes across the oceans and the Eurasian continent, this will have a knock-on effect on energy demand. OPEC is determined to be a reliable partner for China, dependable in meeting China’s oil needs.

With regard to the composition of the energy mix, fossil fuels are expected to retain a dominant role in the global energy mix, albeit with a declining overall share. Oil and gas together are still expected to provide more than half of the world's energy needs from 2016 to 2040, with their combined share relatively stable between 52–53%.

This means there is no expectation for a peak in oil demand over the forecast period to 2040.

It also important to note that to meet the projected increase in global oil demand, investments worth an estimated $10.5 trillion will be required. This underscores the absolutely necessity of a sustainable and stable oil market, conducive to encouraging the type of long-cycle investments necessary to prevent supply gaps in the future. Once more, this shows how critically important the Declaration of Cooperation is.

In Session One, we will discuss the emergence of the United States as a critical oil and gas producer and exporter. I would like to emphasise that US tight oil has been welcomed as it is, and will continue to be, a key component of the global oil supply mix. Tight crude supply from the US and Canada is expected to increase dramatically from 4.5 mb/d in 2016 to 8.7 mb/d in 2025, according to our outlook.

The are many factors behind this growth in US tight oil supply. Firstly, there was the application of the cutting-edge technology of fracking, that made the transition from the gas to the oil industry.

Secondly, there was the emergence of sophisticated, aggressive, managerial skills of unconventional business models. These were especially potent operating within the framework of the world’s most sophisticated financial system. These factors combined to give birth to the tight oil revolution, at a time when there were significant disruptions to supply in key producing countries, including some of our Members.

OPEC recognises the importance of US tight oil, spearheading dialogue with leading stakeholders in the industry and is keen for this to proliferate going forward.

However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the future of US tight oil supply, with technology, economics and geology playing critical roles.

Notably, there has been a recent, important shift in tight oil investor sentiment, from a “growth at any costs” model to an emphasis on returns on capital, cash generation and fiscal discipline. In the longer term, according to our Outlook, US tight oil growth is expected to decelerate, then plateau and peak just after 2025.

It is also important to remember that in the longer term, there is the question of compensating for natural decline rates, which can be as high as 5% per year. To maintain current production levels, the industry might need to add upwards of 4 mb/d each year.

Therefore, given the growth in world oil demand which I mentioned earlier, the uncertainties surrounding the tight oil industry, the expected supply peak in 2025 and natural decline rates, it is clear that US tight oil alone cannot meet all of the market’s needs in the future.

OPEC is a firm advocate of the necessity of all stakeholders in the energy industry working together to overcome the challenges of our times. Nowhere is this approach more indispensable than in the area of tackling climate change.

Last month in Bonn, I had the privilege of addressing the high-level segment of the UN Climate Change Conference, COP 23. In my remarks, I was able to convey what has been OPEC’s consistent position on this global challenge.

OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement. We firmly believe that a global consensus from the multilateral process remains the best and most inclusive way for all nations to collectively counter climate change in a fair and equitable manner.

The fact remains that the world will continue to need all energy sources, especially for the 1.1 billion people in developing countries that suffer from acute energy poverty.

The positive benefits of oil should not be put beyond the reach of millions of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people. It should not be overlooked that our resource has, throughout its history, stimulated economic growth, development, prosperity and social mobility.

The right to have access to modern energy services for the first time, to provide warmth, light and mobility should not be unduly impeded.

I would like to compliment China for accomplishing one of the key pillars in combatting energy poverty, by ensuring the entire Chinese population of nearly 1.4 billion have access to electricity. This example is something other developing countries should aspire to.

Therefore, rather than discriminate against any energy source, it is vital that we collectively develop and adopt technologies that transform the environmental credentials of all energies. In this regard, OPEC welcomes coordinated action between all Parties, with industry and through various research and development platforms.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I have outlined our views at great length because OPEC firmly believes in the fundamental importance of sharing data, information and outlooks. Fostering good relations with all energy stakeholders is of paramount importance. As the old Chinese proverb tells us, “the going is difficult when doing it alone; the going is made easier when doing it with many others.""

I am delighted to be in a country which appreciates the vital need for international collaboration based on the principles of fairness, equity and mutual respect. May these sentiments guide our discussions today and our relations going forward.

Thank you for your kind attention and I wish you a fruitful and productive Forum.

Xie-xie.

"2017-12-12","​Your Excellency, Nur Bekri, Vice Chairman of China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and Administrator of the National Energy Administration (NEA),

​Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, friends,

​Good morning.

​I would like to thank Your Excellency for the warm words of welcome. To all of our colleagues at the NEA who have organised this meeting, I would like to express my gratitude for your gracious hospitality. You have made the OPEC team feel very welcome.

​It is a real pleasure to be here in Beijing today. Few places on earth come close to the extraordinary historical panorama that this city has to offer. For three millennia, Beijing has excelled as a political and cultural hub, so it is a privilege for me to return here.

​Your Excellency, Ladies and gentlemen,

​Almost exactly 12 years ago, on the 22nd December 2005, the first High-Level Meeting of the OPEC-China Energy Dialogue took place here, in Beijing. Subsequently there have been two high level technical roundtables, participation by OPEC at the inaugural International Petroleum and Natural Gas Enterprises Conference in Hangzhou and other bilateral contacts, including a high level meeting with a delegation from the NEA headed by Vice Administrator Mr. Zhang Yuqing in 2015.

​On a personal note, I recall vividly and fondly the first High-Level OPEC-China Roundtable in April 2006, as I was Acting Secretary General at the time. I developed a warm rapport with Mr. Xu Dingming, one of your predecessors who is now a State Council consultant and Vice Chairman of the National Energy Expert Consulting Committee. I look forward to building similarly strong ties with Your Excellency.

​These meetings demonstrated a clear enthusiasm on both sides to enhance relations and explore further possibilities for knowledge exchange.

​I am delighted to say that today, the desire to revive the Energy Dialogue has come to fruition.

​Today’s meeting is extremely important to OPEC for a number of reasons. Firstly, developing constructive relations with all stakeholders in the energy industry is an utmost priority for our Organization. The course of time has repeatedly shown that no single actor or agency acting alone can resolve all of the issues which the energy industry will face.

​It is only through open and transparent dialogue and a spirit of collegiality among all stakeholders that challenges can be overcome and mutually beneficial outcomes reached. As the old Chinese proverb wisely tells us, “a single tree does not make a forest; a single string cannot make music.”

​In this regard it is difficult to overstate the importance of China as a partner for OPEC. Our Member Countries have close and expanding ties with your country, reflecting the importance of China not only to the global economy, but also across a broad range of international issues.

​The interdependence of OPEC and China can be observed in trade volumes. China’s overall imports from OPEC Member Countries amounted to $93 billion in 2016. This is a staggering $85 billion increase from 2000. In the other direction, OPEC’s total imports from China increased from just under $6 billion in 2000 to over $106 billion in 2016.

​In terms of crude oil, China’s total imports have risen from around 1.4 mb/d in 2000 to more than 8.3 mb/d expected for 2017. And close to 60% of this came from OPEC Member Countries. Currently, China is the world’s second largest consumer of oil and is forecast to take first place sometime around 2035. Both China and OPEC Member Countries invest heavily in each other across the supply chain.

​Last month OPEC launched the 2017 edition of its World Oil Outlook to 2040, which underscored China’s importance for the energy industry. In 2016, China accounted for 18% of global GDP. By 2040, this is expected to increase by five percentage points to 23%.

​Global energy demand growth is expected to increase by approximately 96 million barrels of oil equivalent per day between 2016 and 2040. Roughly 23% of this increase will come from China.

​A similar trend can be observed with regard to oil demand, which is expected to grow by 16 mb/d, from 94.4 mb/d in 2016 to 111.1 in 2040. China will account for a staggering 38% of this growth.

​China will also be a leader in the expansion of refining capacity, in both the medium and long term. At the global level, 7.6 mb/d of new distillation capacity is expected between 2017 and 2022. 2.1 mb/d, or approximately 28%, of this will be located in China. Long-term distillation additions follow a similar trend, reaching close to 20 mb/d by 2040 worldwide. 4.2 mb/d of this will be in China, roughly 22% of the global figure.

​Greater refinery capacity in the region will necessitate greater quantities of crude. Significantly for OPEC, this will be reflected in trade flows until 2040, as Chinese imports expand and the volume of OPEC exports becomes higher. According to our estimates, crude exports from OPEC Member Countries to China will increase by close to 4 mb/d between 2016 and 2040, rising from 4.4 mb/d in 2016 to more than 8 mb/d in 2040, representing around 20 % of the world’s total crude oil trade between major regions by 2040.

​So it is absolutely clear that for the foreseeable future, China will be one of the most important outlets for OPEC barrels and hence the importance of our discussions today.

​Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

​Given the trends which I have outlined, it is imperative for China and OPEC Member Countries that the industry has a stable and sustainable oil market, as this is in the interests of producers, consumers, the industry and the global economy alike. This sentiment has underpinned OPEC’s activities aimed at improving market stability over the last year.

​In responding to the extraordinary market volatility which saw the OPEC Reference Basket price fall by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016, OPEC’s approach was very much aligned to the views of President Xi Jinping, when he said in Davos at the World Economic Forum in January of this year, “One should not just retreat to the harbour when encountering a storm, for this will never get us to the other side of the ocean.”

​Throughout the second half of 2016, our Organization embarked on extensive consultations among Member Countries, and between OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations, to build consensus about the strategic urgency of rebalancing the global oil market in a collective manner.

​This culminated in the historic Declaration of Cooperation, whereby 24 oil producing nations agreed at the joint OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting held on the 10th of December 2016, on a concerted effort to accelerate the stabilization of the global oil market through voluntary adjustments in total production of around 1.8 million barrels per day. The second joint OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting, held on the 25th of May 2017, decided to extend the voluntary production adjustments for another nine months commencing on the 1st of July 2017.

​It gives me great pleasure to inform you that just 12 days ago, following the 173rd Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the Third OPEC non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 30th of November, it was decided to amend the Declaration of Cooperation to take effect for the whole of 2018. Furthermore, the solidarity and approval of the international community for this new and amended Declaration of Cooperation was demonstrated by the participation by an additional six non-OPEC countries at our meetings, and their public declarations of support.

​Together, 30 oil producing countries - the largest of its kind - reaffirmed their commitment to restoring stability on a sustainable basis to the oil market, in the interests of producers, consumers and the global economy.

​I am delighted to say that the consequences of our historic cooperation have exceeded even the most optimistic of expectations. The market rebalancing process is well underway, supported by historically high levels of conformity by participating countries. Commercial oil stocks in the OECD fell further in November and the difference to the latest five-year average has been reduced by around 200 million barrels since the beginning of this year. Investments and confidence are returning to the industry and a spirit of collaboration, equity and transparency infuse OPEC’s relations with its non-OPEC oil producing partners.

​Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen,

​I have provided you with this overview because OPEC firmly believes in the fundamental importance of sharing data, information and outlooks. We can explore many of the points I have raised in further detail during our discussions. We are very keen to obtain more insights on the impact of your country’s energy policies on oil demand. Furthermore, we seek your views on identifying synergies that would enhance our cooperation going forward.

​At the World Economic Forum, President Xi also sagaciously said, “Victory is ensured when people pool their strength. Success is secured when people put their heads together.” These wise words should guide the OPEC-China Energy dialogue, as we pool our collective expertise to confront the challenges of the future together.

​I wish us fruitful and productive discussions, and may the relationship between China and OPEC grow from strength to strength.

​Xie-xie

"2017-11-30","​Your Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen: Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to see so many nations participating in the 3rd OPEC and Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

​As we approach the one-year anniversary of the production agreement, I would like to thank all participants, both from OPEC and non-OPEC, for their active and productive engagement.

​I would like to express my special appreciation to His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, who is serving as my co-chair for this meeting, and whose leadership has been instrumental in launching this partnership between OPEC and non-OPEC and achieving the many important successes we have enjoyed to date.

​I also want to recognize the collective efforts of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee under the able leadership of His Excellency Issam A. Almarzooq, Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity and Water of Kuwait, and His Excellency Alexander Novak. I would also like to thank all those involved for their contributions.

​I’m also pleased to see many other non-OPEC producing countries present as observers.

​We would like to warmly welcome:

​His Excellency Parviz Shahbazov of Azerbaijan;
​Dr. Ahmed Al-Sharyan of Bahrain;
​His Excellency Luis Alberto Sanchez Fernández from Bolivia;
​His Excellency Pehin Datu Singamanteri Kolonel Dato Seri Setia Awang from Brunei Darussalam;
​His Excellency Bechir Madet of Chad;
​His Excellency Jean Marc Thystere Tchicaya from Congo;
​His Excellency Eng. Tarek El Molla from Egypt;
​His Excellency Magzum Mirzagaliyev of Kazakhstan;
​The Honorable Datuk Seri Panglima Abdul Rahman Dhalan from Malaysia;
​Dr. Aldo Flores-Quiroga from Mexico;
​His Excellency Dr. Mohammed Al-Rumhy of Oman;
​His Excellency Alexander Novak of the Russian Federation;
​His Excellency Dr. Abdel Rahman Osman Abdel Rahman of Sudan;
​His Excellency Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoh of South Sudan;
​Mr. Japarguly Orazov from Turkmenistan;
​Her Excellency Irene Nafuna Muloni from Uganda;
​Mr. Ulugbek Sayidov from Uzbekistan;
​as well as His Excellency Mahaman Laouan Gaya from the African Petroleum Producers Association.


​Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: almost one year ago, we sat in this same conference room piecing together what has become known as the Declaration of Cooperation, and which has helped the industry recover from one of the worst petroleum market cycles we have experienced in recent history.

​The Declaration of Cooperation was a landmark achievement in itself, and many thought that it would not materialize—and that if it did, it would not be effective in improving market conditions.

​As you know, the agreement was designed to accelerate market rebalancing, hasten the drawdown of the stock overhang, and enhance market stability. The results of our joint efforts are evident—and the numbers speak for themselves.

​I would also like to stress that the coming together of OPEC and non-OPEC producers has made the extraordinary difference that has intensified the impact of our collective efforts and produced the improvements we’ve seen.

​There is now global recognition that without our collaborative action, the market would have continued to exhibit extreme volatility and future uncertainty, with far-reaching negative consequences for producers, consumers, investors, the industry, and the global economy at large.

​Looking ahead, economic performance is improving in most of the world’s leading economies. In fact, the IMF is forecasting global growth in 2018 at 3.7 percent, while the European Commission has just stated that the EU this year is on track to grow at its fastest pace in a decade. Oil demand growth, on the other hand, is on firm ground, and the direction of the market over the past several months shows a distinct improvement in both fundamentals and the overall market sentiment. This gratifying outcome has resulted primarily from 100 percent—or more—compliance to the production targets by OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

​Such positive developments to date show that we’re heading in the right direction—but we are still not where we want to be in terms of inventories reaching their target levels, and must remain resolutely focused on this task. That is why we are here today.

​This morning, at the Meeting of the OPEC Conference, we discussed the current oil market situation and the outlook for 2018, and deliberated on the extension of the current production agreement to continue the improving direction of the market. These issues will now be deliberated with Your Excellencies from the non-OPEC producers with us this afternoon.

​As you know, dealing with the current oil market cycle and its complex challenges has required great patience, resolve and perseverance, and together our countries have shown admirable commitment. To ensure that our hard-earned improvements are not compromised, we must continue to work in unison.

​We look forward to continue working with our non-OPEC partners to build on this unparalleled global platform, going beyond the short term to look at the broader challenges and opportunities the oil industry will face in the years and decades to come.

​Your Excellencies, in conclusion, let me reiterate that today’s meeting provides a tremendous opportunity to strengthen the bonds of cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, and to achieve the sustained market stability we all desire.

​I look forward to our discussions this afternoon, and to continue working with each and every one of you.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/148-30-november-2017.html"
"2017-11-29","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the OPEC Secretariat for the 6th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC).

​We are nearing the one-year anniversary of the implementation of the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, which saw 24 participating OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations come together to help restore order and predictability to the global oil market after one of the worst price declines in history.

​This historic and courageous display of cooperation was the result of tireless consultations, high levels of commitment and a great deal of compromise and flexibility. The process has also required a great deal of patience and perseverance, considering the magnitude and complexity of re-establishing balance to the global oil market.

​Here, allow me to express my deep appreciation to each and every OPEC Member Country and participating non-OPEC producer, who made great sacrifices, worked the extra hours and went the extra mile to help us get to where we are today. With your continued dedication and determination, I am confident we will reach the mountain top together.

​I would also like to recognize my esteemed Alternate Chairman on this Committee, His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, as well as the President of the Conference, His Excellency Khalid A. Al-Falih and the OPEC Secretary General, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo. Their leadership and expert input at every juncture and milestone of this historic process have been instrumental to the ongoing success of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​Another key ingredient in the progress made thus far has been the high-quality input we receive every month from the Joint Technical Committee (JTC), in coordination with the OPEC Secretariat. I know we can count on you to continue operating in the highly professional manner we have come to appreciate and value over the past year.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Since our last meeting in September, the oil market has continued to strengthen and is evidently on the path to rebalancing.

​The destocking process, both onshore and offshore, has continued at an accelerated pace in recent months. From May to October, the OECD stock overhang fell by around 140 mb to stand at 140 mb above the five-year average in October. Looking at the first ten months of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ there has been a decline of around 200 mb.

​Additionally, crude in floating storage has come down by an estimated 50 mb since June, with the help of a narrowing contango, and then Brent, WTI and Dubai flipping into backwardation for the first time since 2014.

​As far as demand goes, we have seen global oil demand growth strengthening. In the December 2016 Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), we saw global oil demand growth for 2017 at a level of 1.15 mb/d. This has been revised up considerably to now stand at 1.5 mb/d. For 2018, this encouraging dynamic is set to continue with the same forecast of 1.5 mb/d.

​Looking at the global economy, the forecast is bullish, as the recovery has picked up steam this year. We are currently forecasting growth this year of 3.7%, supported by positive momentum and a possible tax reform in the US, improving global trade, continued positive outlooks for the Eurozone and, to some extent, Japan, as well as robust growth in China and India. Improved outlooks for Russia and Brazil are also contributing factors. In 2018, this positive trend is expected to continue with a further robust growth forecast of 3.7%.

​This positive outlook has clearly been supported by the unprecedented conformity levels to the production adjustments in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. These consistently high levels, at or above 100%, have quieted the voices of naysayers in the industry who initially expressed doubts regarding the commitment of the 24 participating OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries to bring stability back to the oil market.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Let us not take this positive momentum as a reason to sit back and relax. Rather, let us be energized by the progress we have made, and continue to push onward until we reach our final goal.

​We are clearly on the right path, but there is still work to be done to bring the remaining inventories down to the latest five-year average, at which point we can say we have reached our objectives of a balanced and stable global oil market.

​Thus, today, we will take stock of the recent oil market developments, assess conformity levels, both individually and collectively, and establish what more can be done in the months ahead to improve these levels in order to reach our common goal.

​Here, I think it is pertinent to underline the fact that some participating producing countries continue to over-perform, and I think it is appropriate to recognize their extraordinary efforts. This is also a reminder of how important it is for each country to reach its own conformity goals. Each delegation should be driven to achieve full and timely conformity.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Reflecting back on the first year of implementation, the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ has established the requisite structure and foundation for the sustainable stability we all seek. It will be essential, going forward, that this platform be solidified, institutionalized and expanded.

​Let us not forget that our every move is being scrutinized by the international community. It is thus crucial that we maintain a laser focus on our goal of achieving a rebalanced global oil market. This will boost urgently needed industry investment and fuel future economic growth and prosperity around the world.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/149-29-november-2017.html"
"2017-11-29","​Your Excellencies, distinguished friends and colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, good evening. Welcome to Vienna.

​It is a sincere pleasure to see you all here tonight, in these wonderful surroundings that say so much about the grandeur and history of this great city. The building we are in is indeed steeped in history.

​This magnificent conference room was built in 1575 by Hans Saphoy, and has been used for events meetings and as a ballroom ever since. Even today, the room next door is being used for the coalition talks for the new Austrian Government. I sympathize with those who are having those discussions. Unlike us, they don’t have to think about how long the coalition should last, and how to exit!

​So a great history, yet a place of the future. Very appropriate.

​Tonight we are brought together by our common commitment to the stability of the oil markets and the sustained growth of the global energy industry, which in turn promotes the well-being of the global economy, strengthens energy security, and helps the well-being of our respective countries—and each of you has demonstrated an admirable dedication to those shared goals.

​This evening we will mark a year of progress through collaboration, through trust and through collective responsibility.

​In 2016, oil markets were aimless, the world’s economy was on the rocks, there were fears of deflation, low interest rates to negotiate and prospects for growth were low.

​Although the business and market environment remains challenging, and there are still important and emerging issues which we shall take up during tomorrow’s discussions, but for sure the despair of last year has been replaced by confidence. GDP expectations for one thing, are better than at any time since the middle of the last decade and our collective efforts have contributed to this.

​So, this evening, let me congratulate all of you for participating in the Declaration of Cooperation, which supports our shared goal of market – and global economic - stability. The record-high levels of conformity over the past year are the best indicator of your commitment to this common cause.

​I would also like to recognize the deeper relations between OPEC’s Member Countries and the non-OPEC countries that have joined the historic decision. I want to recognize the tireless work of my friend Alexander Novak towards this effort.

​From the very beginning of consultations last year, we began to see the contours of a new working relationship emerging, which led to the forging of a new consensus. And through our subsequent interactions – particularly through the valuable work of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee – we have made steady advances towards institutionalizing OPEC and non-OPEC collaboration.

​We are marking our progress to date – and celebrating the work of the 24 signatories – in various ways, including tonight’s Anniversary Dinner. But the OPEC Secretariat has sought other forms of acknowledgement as well.

​So I am very pleased to announce the publication of a “Special Edition” of the OPEC Bulletin to commemorate the Anniversary of the Declaration of Cooperation.

​In addition, as a small token of appreciation for the contributions of the delegations to the global oil market, the industry, and OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation, it is an honour to present each of the heads of delegations with a unique gift: a hand-crafted gavel, made from Austrian wood by a talented Austrian craftsman. It commemorates the constructive discussions, intensive negotiations, and momentous decisions that gave birth to the Declaration of Cooperation.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I would like to turn our attention to the great city of Vienna: the city of sophistication, culture and tradition, and OPEC’s home.

​Over the centuries, Vienna has given the world some of its greatest music, art and literature. It has also served as a crossroads of East and West, and plays a major role in world affairs as host to organizations like OPEC and OFID, as well as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, the International Atomic Energy Agency and various UN agencies.

​In order to show our deep appreciation to the city, we have asked the Mayor and Governor of Vienna, Dr. Michael Häupl, to honor us with his presence.

​Dr. Häupl has long been a prominent figure in the city, and is widely appreciated for his public service—particularly his outstanding tenure as the Mayor and Governor of Vienna, a post which he has held since 1994. His leadership qualities are recognized well beyond Austria, and in 2004 he was elected President of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions.

​During his tenure, the city of Vienna has grown in many ways. Dr. Häupl has overseen improvements to transportation infrastructure, the expansion of services, and an overall enhancement of living standards. Vienna is now consistently rated among the best cities in which to live, so whatever you have been doing, Mr. Mayor, it is working beautifully!

​So now, I call upon the OPEC Secretary General to join me as we present the Mayor with gift, and then we will hand over to Dr Michael Häupl, who will say a few words.

​Please enjoy the evening, thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/150-29-november-2017.html"
"2017-11-29","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. Good afternoon.

​I would first like to recognize the dedication and leadership provided to the Monitoring Committee by His Excellency Issam A. Almarzooq, Minister of Oil and Electricity of Kuwait, and His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation.

​This Committee is central to assessing the impact of our efforts to rebalance and stabilize the oil market and ascertaining the necessity and extent of future action.

​It has now been nearly a year since we reached the production agreement, and the results have been gratifying. The compliance results speak for themselves and it would not have been possible without strong leadership and guidance.

​We have reached an average compliance of 102 percent over the first nine months, and in September that figure reached 120 per cent. This level of engagement and commitment has had a positive effect on market confidence and stability.

​Leading indicators show that the destocking process is well underway, as all regions of the world have seen a drawdown that has accelerated in recent months. For the first time in the course of this cycle, OECD storage levels have fallen to 140 million barrels above the rolling five-year industry average from a record 330 million barrels last year.

​For these gratifying results, I want to express my appreciation to the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee and the Joint Technical Committee, as well as to the OPEC Secretariat.

​Let me take a moment to talk in retrospect about the importance of the Committee and its work.

​As important as it is to reach agreements, it is equally critical to turn them into action and maximize their impact on the market. In the absence of actual results, the agreements would in fact generate negative returns as they would adversely impact our reputation.

​So, it is essential that we put the right mechanisms in place to maximize the impact of those agreements. Therefore, I’m glad that we decided early on to set up the correct organizational structure, including the JMMC and the Joint Technical Committee whose hard work has helped guide our respective countries and oil ministries in their complex decision-making over these past months. We have achieved solid results to date, which would not have been possible without each organization in the structure effectively discharging its responsibilities.

​But we cannot afford to be complacent. In order to continue meeting our shared goals, a good deal more hard work and commitment is essential.

​In terms of the process, the committee’s analysis, outlook and recommendations will be used as a basis for deliberations among our Ministers in tomorrow’s meeting, who will then make critical decisions affecting our nations and our economies, the wider oil industry, and in fact the entire global economy. They are relying on you for accurate information, insightful analysis and sound guidance.

​So, in conclusion, I would like to stress that in the coming months our work will continue. We will need the full commitment of all countries. While I want to congratulate and thank the over-performing members for their dedication, I want to urge those few under-performing countries to catch up.

​To succeed in the future, it is crucial that we have everyone on board, and in our shared mutual interest I’m confident that I can count on your support. Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/151-29-november-2017.html"
"2017-11-27","​Distinguished delegates, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,

​I want to share my heartfelt thanks that so many of you have travelled from far and wide to come to Vienna and attend the second edition of our OPEC-non-OPEC technical meeting, under the umbrella of the Declaration of Cooperation. For those of you here for the second time, after attending our 1st Technical Meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC Producing Countries in May, welcome back.

​It is very exciting for me to see how our work together is becoming richer and deeper over time, and how these meetings are giving shape and structure to a framework under which future cooperation and sharing of perspectives will take place.

​This meeting has been organized for the technical experts of OPEC and participating non-OPEC producing countries and is meant to provide the opportunity to exchange views on key factors impacting oil market developments, including a morning session dedicated to developments in non-OPEC liquids supply.

​Before I speak further about what is on the agenda, I want to congratulate everyone here on the one year anniversary of the Declaration of Cooperation. We are here today where others thought we would not be one year ago. We have accomplished what naysayers thought would be impossible, and we have done it with equity, transparency, inclusiveness and fairness. The current market conditions, the returning level of confidence and optimism in the industry are all evidence of the outcome of our joint efforts.

​Together with our non-OPEC partners, we have co-authored a new chapter in the history of this industry, one that is about cooperation, stability and sustainability. Our work together over the past year has forged new relationships between OPEC and non-OPEC countries which never existed in the past. This has led to new friendships, new opportunities and laid the groundwork for ongoing future cooperation. We can be very proud of what we have achieved working together.

​The decisions we made were historic and mark the first time in the history of the industry that 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producers have joined forces to help contribute to improving oil market stability. I am happy to say that we can now firmly put to rest any suggestions that this process we have started and the Declaration of Cooperation could not be successful.

​Our path towards market stability has seen several bumps along the way, and we have suffered occasional setbacks, but our determination and hard work are paying off. The commitment shown by each and every country participating in the Declaration of Cooperation is unprecedented and most remarkable.

​The fact that average conformity to the supply adjustments has been over 100 per cent since the implementation of the decision on January 1 of this year not only warms my heart personally, but has led to a new optimism in the oil market not seen for a very long time.

​Investment is returning, which bodes well for the future. Without investment now, we will not be able to meet the growing future demand of tomorrow, or accommodate the production losses of older fields. The global economy seems to also be benefitting from improvements in the sector, and is witnessing a state of growth not seen since the last financial crisis.

​After reaching record-high levels of more than 380 million barrels over the five-year average, OECD commercial oil inventories have steadily fallen to stand 140 million barrels above the five-year average in October. Additionally, excess crude in floating storage has been drawn down considerably, by 50 million barrels since June 2017, supported by the shift in the market structure where for the first time since the summer of 2014, all major crude oil benchmarks have flipped into backwardation, signaling clearly a market that is steadily returning to balance.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​Today’s meeting follows on the successful first Technical Meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries held on 19th May of this year. Seventeen countries participated in this event, including five non-OPEC countries. Five external experts delivered presentations, which was followed by a very constructive dialogue.

​The special theme chosen at that time was US tight oil prospects. In fact, due to its pertinence and further recommendations, we have dedicated a full-day workshop held on the same subject on 22 November that allowed us a deeper dive on most recent developments and likely prospects. Our special focus in this morning’s session with invited experts will be of complementary nature, namely looking at liquids supply prospects in other non-OPEC regions.

​Our meeting today provides the opportunity to share views on short- and medium-term oil market developments. Additionally, the morning session will focus on conventional non-OPEC liquids supply developments. Our esteemed speakers will discuss supply prospects both globally and in the North Sea, Latin America, Canada, Russia, Kazakhstan and Africa.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​As is stated in the Declaration of Cooperation: “Countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation decided to strengthen their cooperation, including through joint analysis and outlooks, with a view to ensuring a sustainable oil market, for the benefit of producers and consumers and to regularly review at the technical and ministerial levels the status of their cooperation.”

​Our joint meetings and activities will support us in creating a stable market that is less subject to extremes, both today and in the future.

​We must strive to remain committed to our joint statements in the Declaration of Cooperation and ensure continuity. This is beyond attaining short-term market rebalancing, and calls for strengthening our cooperation through a dynamic and transparent framework for sustainable market stability in the medium- to long term. These technical meetings are undoubtedly an integral part of this critical process.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/152-27-november-2017.html"
"2017-11-21","​Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is a great pleasure to return here to this beautiful and historic city of Delft to take part in the 25th Lustrum Symposium.

​In November of 1987, I had the privilege of accompanying the Honourable Dr. Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria’s Minister of Petroleum Resources for his speaking engagement at this very event. At the time, I was Special Assistant to Mr. Lukman and Head of Office for the Chairman of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Board. He went on to serve a very successful term as OPEC Secretary General from 1995 to 2000, a legacy I have now had the honour of inheriting.

​Dr. Lukman was one of the oil industry’s most influential and respected ambassadors and personalities. His illustrious career spanned five decades, and he was one of the longest-serving heads of both the Nigerian oil industry and OPEC.

​As his adopted son, a later friend and a close confidant of his, I can tell you firsthand that he was a true patriot who loved his homeland. Not a day would go by without a discussion on how to best meet the challenges Nigeria was facing. He had our country’s best interests always close to his heart. His legacy will live on, both in Nigeria and around the world. He was truly the most decent person of his generation, an icon of all times!

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​I would like to take this opportunity to thank the esteemed 25th Lustrum Symposium Committee for their kind invitation for me to speak here today.

​It is a privilege for me to return once again to this highly reputed centre for technology education and research — The Delft University of Technology — which is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year.

​The roots of this fine institution date back to the reign of King Willem II who founded the Royal Academy to educate and train engineers, scientists and other civil servants. It has since evolved and grown in stature and prestige to become the Netherlands’ largest and oldest technological university. Additionally, it is competitively ranked among the world’s top technological universities.

​Many students who have had the privilege to walk these hallowed corridors have graduated and gone on to achieve great things. Many are leaders in their respective fields of expertise, and some have even been awarded the prestigious Nobel Prize for their outstanding scientific achievements.

​These include Jacobus Henricus van't Hoff, who, in 1901, was the recipient of the first-ever Nobel Prize for chemistry for his innovative work related to rates of chemical reaction, chemical equilibrium and osmotic pressure. Then, in 1913, Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics for his cutting-edge research that led to the production of liquid helium. And then, more recently, in 1984, a second Dutchman, Simon van der Meer, was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics, along with Carlo Rubbia, for groundbreaking contributions to the CERN project, which led to the discovery of the W and Z particles, two of the main constituents of matter.

​These are truly achievements that have changed the course of science and innovation, and it is indeed both inspirational and humbling to be here in the very academic halls where these legendary minds developed and perfected their insights.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​The theme of this year’s Lustrum Symposium is “Energy transition, the world with a growing natural resource demand”.

​I couldn’t think of a more timely and relevant theme for our industry and indeed for OPEC, as we have just released our 2017 World Oil Outlook (WOO) on the 7th of November.

​This annual publication provides a comprehensive overview on the medium to long-term forecasts to 2040 for the global oil and gas industry. It also offers valuable insight into the uncertainties and challenges that lay ahead for the industry.

​Now, I would like to begin by providing you with a few highlights from this year’s edition of the WOO. I will then link these findings back to our short-term outlook by touching on OPEC’s latest efforts in cooperation with non-OPEC producers to bring an enduring stability to the global oil market.

​The 2017 WOO provides a comprehensive analysis of what lies ahead for the global oil market and our industry in the timespan leading to the year 2040.

​First of all, it is important to understand that oil and gas will continue to play a major role in the world’s energy mix for the foreseeable future, contributing an estimated 52% of the global energy mix by 2040.

​Looking at demand, we see total primary energy demand increasing by 35% in the period to 2040. Long-term oil demand is projected to surpass 100 mb/d in 2020 to reach a level of more than 111 mb/d by 2040.

​The majority of this rising demand will come from developing countries, increasing by almost 24 mb/d, to reach 67 mb/d by 2040.

​I should add here that there is no expectation for peak oil demand over the forecasted period, and oil will continue to be relied upon over the long term to help meet the world’s rapidly rising energy requirements.

​This is no small challenge when you consider that an estimated 1.1 billion people around the world still have no access at all to electricity.

​Looking at the industry sectors driving this growth, the three main ones will be road transportation (5.4 mb/d), petrochemicals (3.9 mb/d) and aviation (2.9 mb/d).

​Now, turning to the supply picture, non-OPEC liquids supply is forecast to increase from 57 mb/d in 2016 to 62 mb/d in 2022. This is mainly a result of the recovery and improved outlook for US tight oil production, however, when we look further ahead, we see non-OPEC liquids output dropping to 60.4 mb/d by 2040.

​This dynamic bodes well for OPEC crude, which will benefit from rising demand, reaching an estimated 41.4 mb/d by 2040. The share of OPEC liquids in the total global liquids supply is forecast to rise to 46% by 2040, up from 40% in 2016.

​The WOO also covers an issue that has been elevated to the top of the industry agenda, and that is the urgent need to reinstate robust, long-term investment to the industry.

​The current downward price cycle, which began midway through 2014, saw a stunning 80% drop in the OPEC Reference Basket from June 2014 until January 2016, the largest percentage fall of the six previous declines we have witnessed over the last 40 years.

​The effects on the industry were severe — industry budgets were depleted and exploration and production spending was reduced by an enormous 27% in both 2015 and 2016. In total, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued, and many thousands of industry staff were cut from payrolls.

​So, considering both the fallout from this crisis I have just described, in relation to the need to meet rapidly rising world oil demand in the coming decades, it is clearly imperative that industry investment be urgently restored to levels that will secure the energy requirements of future generations. To achieve this, an estimated $10.5 trillion in industry investment is expected to be required from now until 2040.

​On a positive note, we do see investment picking up slightly this year and in 2018, but this is far from the levels we have witnessed in the past. In particular, the industry is in dire need of investment in long-cycle projects, which are crucial to longer-term industry growth.

​It is also important to remember here that this is not only a question of increasing new production, but producers will also need to compensate for natural decline rates, which can be 5% per year. So, to maintain current production levels, the industry might need to add upwards of 4 mb/d each year.

​Here, I should point out that OPEC Member Countries have continued to invest in their industries throughout this volatile down-cycle. This has positioned them well to maintain their leading roles as reliable suppliers to growing economies around the world, including right here in Europe.

​Let us not forget, though, that the foundation for investment and growth can only come through balance and stability in the market. It is always worth recalling that long-term security of supply is intrinsically linked to short-term conditions.

​And, indeed, on this front, OPEC and its non-OPEC partners continue to forge ahead in restoring balance and stability to the market.

​The data is clear that progress is being made — global stocks are coming down, the world economic outlook is positive and we see robust demand ahead. We are on the path to stability.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​The historic Declaration of Cooperation, now in its eleventh month, has provided an effective framework for the development of lasting market stability.

​Next week at the 173rd Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the 3rd OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 30 November, we will commemorate the one-year anniversary of this landmark cooperation.

​These committed efforts will continue until we see the global stock overhang come down to the five-year average, indicating a balanced market.

​We are not out of the woods just yet, but we are getting there, step by step, thanks to a good measure of patience, perseverance and focus.

​When we do achieve our common goal, though, all stakeholders across the entire industry stand to benefit, not just the participating producers of the Declaration of Cooperation.

​A revived and growing global oil market will, in turn, also boost the global economy, promoting development and prosperity around the world.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​In today’s globalized and increasingly interdependent global oil industry, stakeholders must work together to achieve their common goals.

​This makes all the more sense when you consider that stakeholders often share common challenges and want to accomplish similar objectives.

​This brings me to another important area in which we are working together with the international community to achieve a common objective. And that is the issue of environment and sustainability.

​Just last week, we were in Bonn, Germany for the high-level segment of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 23/CMP 13/CMA 1-2).

​At this Conference, we deliberated extensively on how the world can meet the rapidly rising energy needs of future generations while still protecting our environment.

​OPEC supports the comprehensive implementation of the Paris Agreement. All 14 OPEC Member Countries have signed the Agreement, and eight of them have ratified it. The rest are in the process of ratification.

​We will remain fully engaged in this process to help reach a global consensus on how the world community can come together to tackle climate change in a fair and equitable manner.

​The fact is that the world will require all energy sources now and in the future to ensure adequate supply levels, and fossil fuels are still plentiful. At present, the world’s proven crude oil reserves alone stand above 1.2 trillion barrels.

​It is also important to recognize the positive aspects of these resources and how they have impacted the lives of billions around the world for hundreds of years.

​Without them, we could not have achieved the economic growth, development and prosperity we enjoy today. Indeed, they are the basis upon which our modern civilization is built.

​Our industry should appreciate this and be proud of this progress. These natural resources are fundamental to our daily lives, and will continue to be well into the future.

​At the same time, we are fully aware that there are environmental issues regarding the emissions that emanate from fossil fuels.

​However, we also believe that viable solutions can be developed by leveraging cutting-edge technology that has the potential to minimize and even, eventually, eliminate these emissions.

​In this regard, we must support the development of cleaner fossil fuel technologies, such as carbon capture utilization and storage, and other innovative solutions in the future.

​Our Member Countries have already been active in utilizing these technologies, and I expect this will increasingly be the case in the years to come.

​At OPEC, we will continue to prioritize the advancement of the environmental credentials of oil, both in production and usage.

​Here, I should mention that institutions of higher learning, such as this prestigious university here in Delft, have an important role to play in this process.

​Your groundbreaking research efforts could make a difference in helping us ensure the sustainable development of this growth industry.

​Let me also point out that when we talk of an energy transition, this does not necessarily mean moving from one energy source to another.

​As I mentioned previously, all energy sources will be needed in the years ahead to meet rising demand, and each source has an important role to play in the overall energy mix.

​The energy transition, in a broader context, also means ensuring that energy is made available to all of the world’s citizens.

​This entails a transition to a more inclusive world in which every person has access to energy — whether young or old, whether poor or rich. We want to see a world where no one is left behind.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​I have outlined a wide range of issues and challenges here today that will need to be managed in the years to come, both in the short term, as well as the medium and long terms. And, we are currently making inroads in addressing some of these.

​However, going forward, we will need the participation of all industry stakeholders — producers, consumers, academia and civil society — to achieve a sustainable stability for our industry.

​We have already witnessed the strength and effectiveness of cooperation as manifested by the landmark Declaration of Cooperation. But, we can do more.

​Thus, I would like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation to the world’s oil producers to join this unprecedented dialogue and cooperation that began last year in Algiers.

​Join us and become part of the new golden chapter that is being composed in the history book of our industry.

​These are challenging, yet exciting times in this industry, especially when you consider how a diverse group of industry players voluntarily came together in a historic commitment to cooperate and make a difference, for the benefit of all.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​In 1945, against the backdrop of a turbulent time in world history, former US President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, delivered the following words to the United States Congress:

​He said “The point in history at which we stand is full of promise and danger. The world will either move forward toward unity and widely shared prosperity - or it will move apart”.

​Seventy-two years later, these words of wisdom are not only most relevant today, but in fact prophetic!

​We all aspire to have success, growth, development and prosperity for ourselves, for our children and for our children’s children. This is our natural human desire.

​So, let us continue to work together as one team, unified in the spirit of cooperation and dialogue, to achieve a global oil market that is stable, growing and sustainable.

​This will pave the way to the widely shared prosperity that we all desire.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/153-21-november-2017.html"
"2017-11-16","Mr. President,

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

On behalf of OPEC, I would like to offer our deep appreciation to the Government of Fiji, the city of Bonn, and the UNFCCC Secretariat, for their excellent arrangements and warm hospitality.

We join all Parties in congratulating Fijian Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama for courageously undertaking the Presidency of COP 23 at this crucial time in the UNFCCC process.

OPEC remains fully engaged and supportive of the Paris Agreement. We believe a global consensus out of the multilateral process remains the best and most inclusive way for all nations to collectively tackle climate change in a fair and equitable manner.

In terms of the implementation of the Paris Agreement, we need to ensure a Party-driven process; recall different national circumstances; evoke the principles of equity and of common but differentiated responsibilities; balance mitigation, adaptation and the means of implementation, including financing for developing countries to support their actions; and take into account the overriding priority of sustainable development.

This should appreciate what the term ‘energy transition’ means for those 1.1 billion people in developing countries that continue to suffer from acute energy poverty. It is not about a transition from one energy source to another; it is about the right to have access to modern energy services for the first time, to provide warmth, light and mobility.

It should also not discriminate against any energy source. The world will continue to need all energy sources now and in the future. It is therefore vital we collectively develop and adopt technologies that transform the environmental credentials of all energies. In this regard, OPEC welcomes coordinated action between all Parties, with industry and through various research and development platforms.

The comprehensive implementation of the Paris Agreement should be ‘win-win’ in nature, recognize the diverse priorities and circumstances of all Parties, and contribute to global growth, development and prosperity.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/154-16-november-2017.html"
"2017-11-13","Chairman, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Good morning.

It is my distinct honour to take part in this Opening Ceremony of the 2017 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference under the Patronage of His Highness, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates.

It is also a privilege to be on this panel of high-level dignitaries — His Excellency, Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, UAE Minister of Energy; and His Excellency, Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and Group Chief Executive Officer of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.

Allow me to express my appreciation to the UAE Government and its Energy Ministry for the invitation to speak here. I commend you on the wide variety of relevant, timely and innovative topics covered in this year’s programme under the theme: “Forging Ties, Driving Growth.”

Now in its 32nd edition and with more than 10,000 delegates attending from over 100 countries, ADIPEC has evolved into one of the world’s top-tier international energy conferences and exhibitions, and is set to break its records in international participation. For OPEC, this high-caliber event, hosted by our Member Country, the United Arab Emirates, is a yearly highlight on our events calendar.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Last year at this time, OPEC was in the midst of ongoing extensive and intensive consultations taking place between our Member Countries and also with non-OPEC Member Countries in a valiant effort to respond to what is considered to be the worst oil price down-cycle in history. The world had witnessed the OPEC Reference Basket price plummet by an unprecedented 80% to $22 per barrel by January of 2016.

These high-level deliberations took place across the world and culminated in the adoption of three key historic decisions:

Last year, there were many in the industry who expressed scepticism on the ability of OPEC to once again rise to the challenge, re-establish confidence, re-build consensus and reach out to non-OPEC producers for a global response to the most severe oil market cycle in recent history. These sceptics were not only confounded by the landmark and historic decisions we reached, including the unparalleled levels of implementation, but have now acknowledged the validity of this global approach, as the only viable option to restore the much needed stability to this industry and its markets.

Today, the oil industry, and indeed the global economy, are clearly benefiting from the noble efforts of this unprecedented joint decision of the 24 OPEC and non-OPEC participating producers of the Declaration of Cooperation.

We are seeing clear indications that the market is rebalancing at an accelerating pace and stability is steadily returning. Based on our latest OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report published today, global stock levels are visibly down. The stock overhang since the beginning of this year alone has dropped by more than 180 mb. The global economic growth dynamic has continued its momentum with the forecast for 2017 revised up to 3.7%, and the economic outlook is positive into 2018, expected to remain at 3.7%. Global demand growth for oil is higher and robust, and is expected to remain above 1.5 mb/d for both 2017 and 2018, higher than in the previous assessment.

I am certain that if we had not mobilized ourselves when we did, building consensus and jointly taking action in responding to the crisis, the industry would be in a different condition than it is today.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

A new chapter is being authored in the history of the industry by OPEC and its non-OPEC partners, who continue to demonstrate the power of cooperation and dialogue to restore stability and growth in the global oil market.

This afternoon, I look forward to taking part in the C-Suite Dialogue session, entitled “The OPEC Discussion — Stability through Collaboration”. At that time, I will elaborate further on our broad-based international cooperation efforts to achieve sustainable market stability. I will also share some highlights from this year’s OPEC World Oil Outlook, which we have just released on 7 November.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope to see you again in the afternoon.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/155-13-november-2017.html"
"2017-11-13","​Chairman, excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good afternoon.

​I had the honour of addressing the ADIPEC 2017 Official Opening Ceremony this morning to speak about the latest developments in OPEC’s unprecedented cooperation with its non-OPEC partners through the Declaration of Cooperation.

​I pointed out how these courageous efforts, despite the voices of many who raised doubts at the outset, are now paying off in the form of a rebalancing market and a steady return of stability and predictability to the market.

​South African Freedom Fighter and former President, Nelson Mandela, once said: “It always seems impossible until it is done.”

​And, indeed, step by step, we are making progress towards achieving our common goal.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​We all know that we cannot look at the oil market simply from a short-term viewpoint, but rather we must step back and take stock of the larger picture.

​That is what I would like to do in the next few minutes.

​Just last week, we released our 2017 World Oil Outlook (WOO), the eleventh edition, which is OPEC’s annual flagship publication covering the medium to long-term outlooks for global oil and gas industry. We will also be presenting it today here at ADIPEC in the Middle East Petroleum Club at 4:25 this afternoon, so please attend if you can.

​I should also note that, in addition to the print version of the WOO, we also provide an online interactive version that enables users to download specific data and information that support the analysis and commentary.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The 2017 WOO paints a comprehensive picture of the path that lies ahead for the global oil market and our industry.

​First of all, it tells us that oil and gas will continue to play a major role in the world’s energy mix for the foreseeable future, contributing an estimated 52% of the global energy mix by 2040.

​Looking at demand, we see total primary energy demand increasing by 35% in the period to 2040. Long-term oil demand has been revised upward by 1.7 mb/d compared to last year’s WOO, with total demand now projected at over 111 mb/d by 2040. For the first time in history, demand is poised to hit the 100 mb/d mark by 2020.

​The majority of this rising demand will come from developing countries, increasing by almost 24 mb/d, to reach 67 mb/d by 2040. The main sectors driving this growth are road transportation (5.4 mb/d), petrochemicals (3.9 mb/d) and aviation (2.9 mb/d).

​Let me add here that, despite some common misperceptions among some analysts in the industry, we see no expectation for peak oil demand over the forecasted period. It is clear that oil will continue to play a major role over the long term in helping to meet the rapidly rising needs of these developing countries.

​The scope of the challenge cannot be underestimated when you consider that an estimated 1.1 billion people around the world still have no access to electricity and over 2 billion rely predominantly on biomass.

​Now, looking at the supply side, non-OPEC liquids supply has been revised upward from last year’s WOO from 57 mb/d to 62 mb/d in 2022. This is largely due to the recovery and improved outlook for US tight oil production, however, when we look further ahead, we see non-OPEC liquids output dropping to 60.4 mb/d by 2040. This is expected to translate into increased demand for OPEC crude, which is anticipated to reach 41.4 mb/d by 2040. The estimated share of OPEC liquids in total global liquids supply is expected to increase to 46% by 2040, up from 40% in 2016.

​Another key issue featured in the 2017 WOO and an issue that is being discussed widely in the industry is the crucial need to reinstate adequate levels of long-term investment to the industry.

​The recent price crash put a severe dent in industry budgets, with exploration and production spending falling by a massive 27% in both 2015 and 2016. Overall, nearly one trillion dollars in investments were frozen or discontinued, not to mention the many thousands of jobs that were lost.

​With the massive upswing in demand forecast for the years ahead, a top priority for the industry will be to urgently restore investment to levels that will secure the energy requirements of future generations. Accomplishing this will be no small task as an estimated $10.5 trillion will need to be invested in the industry from now until 2040.

​Although investments are expected to pick up slightly this year and in 2018, we are nowhere near the levels we have seen in the past. In addition, we are seeing more evidence of short-cycle rather than long-cycle projects, which form the basis for future industry growth. In fact, there are industry reports of sharp decreases in funds flowing into shale basins in the US from both public and private equity, which previously fueled the massive expansion.

​And, let us remember that this is not only about boosting new production. Oil producers will need to account for natural decline rates, which can be 5% per year. This means that to maintain current production levels, the industry could be required to add more than 4 mb/d each year.

​I must point out, though, that the foundation for investment and growth will only come through stability in the market. That is why we must always remind ourselves that long-term security of supply and short-term conditions are directly linked.

​And, I am here to respectfully report to you that OPEC and its non-OPEC partners are making headway in restoring balance to the market. With global stocks coming down, a positive economic outlook and robust demand ahead, we are on the right track.

​Based on our latest OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report published today, global stock levels are visibly down. Total OECD commercial oil stocks fell in September to stand below 300 mb. Thus, the stock overhang since the beginning of this year alone has dropped by more than 180 mb.

​The global economic growth dynamic has continued its momentum with the forecast for 2017 revised up to 3.7%, and the economic outlook is positive into 2018 with the rate remaining at 3.7%. Better-than-expected growth in the OECD area, solid growth in China and India, as well as improving situations in Russia and Brazil are all supporting the growth.

​Global demand growth for oil is higher and robust, and is expected to remain above 1.5 mb/d for both 2017 and 2018. This is higher than in the previous assessment and can be attributed, in particular, to a strong performance in Asia.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The landmark Declaration of Cooperation, now in its eleventh month, has provided the necessary framework for the development of a lasting stability in the market. At the upcoming 173rd Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the 3rd OPEC-Non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on 30 November, we will commemorate the one-year anniversary of this path-breaking, landmark cooperation.

​These committed efforts will continue until a sustainable stability in the market is achieved. When this occurs, it is not just OPEC and non-OPEC Member Countries that will benefit, but rather the entire industry and all of its stakeholders. It will be a win-win for all.

​As we go forth on this path to a lasting stability, we welcome a broader dialogue among other producers outside of the Declaration of Cooperation, as well as consumers. In this regard, we hope to build upon the dialogue with producers in the US that debuted a year ago with my week-long visit to the United States for high-level meetings in Washington and New York, and continued in March of this year at CERA Week in Houston.

​All these efforts boil down to one thing — in an increasingly globalized and interdependent global oil industry, stakeholders must work together to achieve their common goals. They face the same daunting challenges and, many times, share the same objectives.

​Therefore, I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to the world’s oil producers to join this train of global stability in the oil industry that took off last year in Algiers. Together, let us endeavour to achieve a global oil market that is once again healthy, growing and sustainable for the benefit of this and future generations.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/156-13-november-2017.html"
"2017-10-19","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It gives me great pleasure to once again speak at the annual Oil & Money conference in London. I would like to thank the Chair of this session, Herman Franssen, for his generous introduction, as well as the organizers, Energy Intelligence and the New York Times, for the invitation.

​Since the conference’s inauguration in 1980, which makes this the 38th edition, it has become one of the industry’s premier gatherings. It is truly a highlight of the industry’s annual conference calendar.

​Before I begin engaging with you on our perspectives about the current oil market outlook, I would also like to offer my congratulations to the recipient of this year’s Energy Intelligence Petroleum Executive of the Year Award, Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Total.

​Patrick is a very dear friend, and he is thoroughly deserving of this prestigious award. His determination, dynamism and drive in steering Total through the enormous industry challenges of the past few years, and in strategically repositioning the company, have been rightly commended by his peers.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​I recall speaking here at last year’s Oil & Money conference, sharing a platform with another good friend, Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency.

​The focus on OPEC back then concerned the decision adopted by OPEC Member Countries at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference on September 28, 2016 in Algiers. Here, the OPEC Conference opted for an OPEC production target ranging between 32.5 and 33 million barrels a day, to bring the market rebalancing forward and help return a sustainable stability to the industry.

​At this conference last year there was acknowledgement of the extensive efforts that went into the decision taken in Algiers, but I was also greeted with some scepticism about whether OPEC could implement what was agreed in Algiers in a full and timely manner. Moreover, there were possibly even more sceptics who poured scorn on the idea of bringing on board non-OPEC nations to take part in the market rebalancing process.

​I am happy to stand here today and say that those sceptics were mistaken.

​Through extensive and well-coordinated consultations, enormous commitment, great diligence, necessary flexibility and strategic compromises, 24 participating OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations agreed on the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ at the end of last year, whereby they decided to adjust production by approximately 1.8 mb/d, for a period of six months, beginning January 1. This has since been extended by a further period of nine months, to the end of March 2018.

​The ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ is unparalleled in the history of the oil industry. Given the nature of this oil market cycle, with the magnitude of the price drop in real terms higher than for all previous cycles, the multiplier effect that low oil prices have had on deflation, and its destructive impact on investments, companies and jobs, a collective and concerted effort was required. No-one could have acted alone.

​The historic commitment made by the 24 oil producing nations was one to all industry stakeholders, both producers and consumers, as well as one to the broader global community, through the move to restore oil market stability and the potential positives of this for the global economy.

​Of course, when the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ came into being, we also recognized that this historic decision was only the end of the beginning of this process. The decision had to be delivered on.

​Again, we were greeted with sceptics – we heard stories of OPEC’s often weak conformity to past production adjustments, and the lack of past support from non-OPEC nations.

​While the process has not always been smooth given the severity of this cycle, I believe that if we look back over the past nine months or so we can be happy with our collective efforts to overcome the challenges of the current oil market cycle.

​There is no doubt that the market is rebalancing at an accelerating pace; stability is steadily returning; and there is far more light at the end of the dark tunnel we have been travelling down for the past three years.

​Together with our friends from non-OPEC we definitely turned an historic page in December 2016 and today we are helping write a new chapter of sustained stability in the global oil industry.

​I have heard firsthand a general feeling of optimism, from Russia’s President Vladimir Putin; from a variety of OPEC and non-OPEC Ministers, all of whom are part of the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’; as well as in India, a major consuming country that is expected to lead oil demand growth in the years and decades ahead.

​I have gauged the industry’s temperature. There is no doubt that we are starting to feel a warmer glow. There is now more talk of a brighter outlook. It is a feeling that has been missing from the industry for far too long. This positivity is underscored by recent data.

​The global economic recovery has gathered momentum this year. In our December 2016 MOMR, we saw global growth for 2017 at a level of 3.1%. However, this has since been revised up significantly to 3.6%, on the back of improving global trade, potential tax reform in the US, the ongoing positive dynamic in the Eurozone and, to some extent, in Japan, solid growth in China and India and a marked improvement in Russia and Brazil. For 2018, this positive trend is set to continue with a healthy growth forecast of 3.5%.

​This was supported by the International Monetary Fund during the recent annual IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington, with Christine Lagarde, the IMF Managing Director, stating that it is the first time in a decade that we have seen such a strong recovery.

​Correspondingly, global oil demand growth has also been robust and there are signs of a strengthening trend. In our December 2016 MOMR, we saw global oil demand growth for 2017 at a level of 1.15 mb/d. This has been revised up considerably to now stand at 1.5 mb/d. For 2018, this encouraging dynamic is set to continue with a forecast of 1.4 mb/d.

​We are not alone in our more positive oil demand numbers, with many other agencies revising their demand numbers upward in recent months.

​The process of onshore and offshore destocking continues apace.

​At the start of 2017, the OECD stock overhang was at 338 mb above the five-year average. This level fell gradually in the first four months of this year to just below 300 mb. In the following five months from May to September, however, it fell by over 140 mb to stand at 159 mb above the five-year average for the month of September.

​Of this, 132 mb constitutes crude and 27 mb products. It underscores the fact that product inventories have almost converged with the five-year average.

​Crude in floating storage is also down by an estimated 50 mb since June, with the help of a narrowing contango, and then Brent flipping into a clear backwardation for the first time since the second half of 2014.

​There has been a massive drainage of oil tanks across all regions, in terms of both crude and products. A balanced oil market is now fully in sight.

​This process has evidently been driven by the unprecedented conformity levels to the production adjustments in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. These consistently high monthly conformity levels around or over 100% have now put to rest any scepticism on the commitment of all participating OPEC and non-OPEC countries to jointly restore balance to the oil market.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​The first nine months of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ have laid the much needed foundations for the sustainable stability we all desire. It is vital that this platform is not only retained, but built upon.

​Firstly, we need to ensure that balance is achieved in a full and timely manner. This benefits all industry stakeholders.

​Let me stress that we continue to welcome dialogue among other producers outside of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, as well as consumers. For instance, we appreciated the initial dialogue we had with US independents at CERA Week in Houston in March.

​We all understand that we are part of a dynamic and inter-linked global oil market; one where we share common challenges and responsibilities.

​Secondly, we need to appreciate that the short-, medium and long-terms are all interlinked. We require stability and balance across all timeframes to ensure future demand growth is met. Here, it is particularly vital to focus on investments.

​In our upcoming World Oil Outlook 2017, to be launched on November 7 in Vienna, we expect demand to pass 100 mb/d in 2020 and to reach over 111 mb/d by 2040. Let me stress that we see demand growing in every year of the Outlook. There is no peak oil demand for the foreseeable future.

​On top of this, we should also remember that oil producers and companies must invest heavily simply to offset the impact of natural decline rates. The general consensus is an annual decline rate of 5%, which suggests that the industry needs to add over 4 mb/d each year to just maintain current production levels.

​Investments are expected to pick up slightly this year and in 2018. However, this is not anywhere close to past levels and it is more evident in short-cycle, rather than long-cycle projects, which are the industry’s baseload.

​I should stress that OPEC Member Countries themselves have defied the trend and continued to invest through the industry downturn. OPEC is therefore positioned to continue to be a dependable and reliable supplier of crude and products to global markets.

​And thirdly, from the perspective of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, at OPEC we recognize the importance of institutionalizing a framework that builds on this unparalleled global platform of stability. This would go beyond the short-term and look at some of the broader challenges, as well as opportunities, the oil industry is expected to face in the years and decades ahead.

​For example, as we look to the UNFCCC’s COP 23 in Bonn next month, the key question is how can we as an industry further help meet the challenge of climate challenge? Of course, we acknowledge the challenges of emissions that come from burning fossil fuels, but I am a believer that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions. In this regard, I welcome coordinated action within the industry and through various research and development platforms, such as the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative.

​From OPEC’s perspective, earlier this week we convened a technical workshop to examine issues related to the UNFCCC process in the lead up to COP 23, which included representatives from OPEC and non-OPEC, the UNFCCC Secretariat, India, as well as internationally renowned experts. It is vital we stay fully engaged, play a leading role, and develop our own rule book for the Paris Agreement and beyond.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​As the great Henry Ford once said: “Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success”. We want to ensure that the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, which remains open to other producers, works for everyone, across all timeframes to help deliver the sustainable market stability we all desire.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/157-19-october-2017.html"
"2017-10-09","​Ladies and gentlemen,
​Good day.

​I would like to begin by thanking Reuters for this generous invitation to speak at this important and timely Commodities Summit that is being held this week across its bureaus in London, Singapore, New York, Houston and Toronto. Even though my schedule did not permit me to physically be in London for this global forum, I am pleased to be able to share with you our perspectives in OPEC on the current dynamic oil market conditions.

​When you listen to our contributions today, I will be at another important energy forum in India, a country that will be a central driver to global oil demand growth in the years and decades ahead.

​This follows my attendance last week at the Russia Energy Week in Moscow, where I shared a speaking platform with President Vladimir Putin, and held talks with Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, Industry & Mineral Resources and the President of the OPEC Conference, Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, as well as other OPEC and non-OPEC Ministers that are part of the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​These two almost back-to-back important energy fora, held at a critical juncture in the evolution of the current oil market cycle, underscores the importance OPEC attaches to dialogue and cooperation with both producers and consumers.

​This is particularly relevant given the ongoing market rebalancing process that is vital to the sustainable market stability that both producers and consumers desire, and which is beneficial to the global economy as a whole. The best way to achieve this is to do so collaboratively, in consultation with other energy stakeholders.

​This has been the focus of the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ and the production adjustments reached by OPEC and participating non-OPEC producers at the end of 2016 and then extended in May 2017, for a further period of nine months to the end of March 2018.

​It has been a major commitment from 24 producing countries as we look to see the return of sustainable market stability.

​We are now just over nine months into the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. I could tell you that the process has been a straightforward one, but I think we can all appreciate that the rebalancing process was never going to happen overnight and it was never going to happen in a linear fashion.

​To help contain, and then alleviate the current oil market cycle, has required great patience, resolve and perseverance. The cycle has been described by many as the worst they have ever seen in the history of the industry.

​It is a cycle that saw the OPEC Reference Basket fall by an extraordinary 80 per cent between June 2014 and January 2016, the largest percentage fall in the six episodes of sharp price declines we have observed over the past four decades; where thousands upon thousands of jobs were lost; where many projects and investments were frozen or discontinued; and where many companies saw great financial and operational stresses.

​We believe that developments this year have helped stem the industry’s hemorrhaging. It has put a stop to the industry being stuck in reverse.

​Today, I believe we are seeing some concrete and tangible results. As the great Chinese philosopher, Confucius, once said: “The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones”.

​We have every reason to be satisfied with the steady and ever-improving progress we have made in our collective efforts to overcome the challenges of the current oil market cycle. As I said in Moscow last week, it is “so far, so good”. There is clear evidence that the market is rebalancing.

​The process of global destocking continues, both onshore and offshore, with positive developments in recent months showing not only a quickening of the process, but a massive drainage of oil tanks across all regions.

​At the start of this year, the OECD stock overhang was at 340 million barrels above the five-year average. This level fell gradually in the first four months of this year to just below 300 million barrels. In the next four months, however, it fell by a huge 130 million barrels to stand at 170 million barrels above the five-year average for the month of August.

​From this figure of 170 million barrels, 145 million barrels constitute crude and a mere 25 million barrels are products, almost converging with the five-year average.

​Crude in floating storage is also down by an estimated 40 million barrels since the start of the year, with the help of a narrowing contango since June, and then Brent flipping into a clear backwardation from the second week of September. This trend will obviously make it unprofitable to continue to store crude.

​These strong and positive signs are evidence that the fundamentals of supply and demand are gradually, but steadily returning to balance.

​There are a number of factors why the rebalancing has recently gathered pace, including the unprecedented high conformity levels among the 24 participating nations in terms of the production adjustments; strong oil demand growth; and slower than anticipated growth in US tight oil supply.

​Conformity levels to the production adjustments have been remarkably strong throughout the year. The 5th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee held on September 22 in Vienna confirmed the effectiveness of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, with the month of August hitting a remarkable overall conformity level of 116%!

​It has sent a clear message to the market that countries that are part of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ have their eyes firmly on the goal of bringing back sustainable market stability.

​Global oil demand growth has also been robust, with an estimated increase of close to 2 million barrels a day from the first to the second half of this year. Moreover, the OPEC Secretariat in our most recent Monthly Oil Market Report raised projections for oil demand in both 2017 and 2018. These upward demand revisions are most likely to be an ongoing trend.

​In addition, we have recently seen a deceleration in US tight oil growth compared to the first half of the year, evidenced recently by the falling productivity of wells, particularly in the Permian, as well as growing concerns from the investment community.

​While there are clearly a number of positives to point to in the rebalancing process, we also need to be cognizant that challenges remain.

​This is particularly evident when we look at investment. While investments are expected to pick up slightly this year and in 2018, it is clear that this is not anywhere close to past levels and it is more evident in short-cycle, rather than long-cycle projects, which are the industry’s baseload.

​The issue of a potential investment shortfall was a recurring theme at last week’s Russia Energy Week conference, with President Vladimir Putin, as well as many oil and energy ministers making reference to the critical investment challenge.

​As we have all learned from previous price cycles, such pronounced and long-term declines in investments are a serious threat to future supply. But given our projected future demand for oil, with our upcoming World Oil Outlook 2017 expecting demand to reach over 111 million barrels a day by 2040, an increase of almost 16 million barrels a day, the world simply cannot afford a supply crunch.

​Recognizing and respecting the link between long-term security of supply and short-term conditions is critical.

​Let me assure you that from the perspective of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, all participants remain committed to fully achieving its goals and objectives. We will not waiver; we will not tire.

​Our steely and resolute focus remains on reducing inventories, moving the stock overhang to its five-year average and ensuring sustainable market stability in the years and decades ahead.

​Thank you for your kind attention, and I wish you all a very successful conference.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/159-9-october-2017.html"
"2017-10-08","​Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Chairman,

​I should first like to thank the Government of India, under the able leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for hosting this prestigious, high-level gathering here in New Delhi. It is always a great pleasure to return to your great country, with its rich history, culture and traditions. On behalf of OPEC, kindly accept our best wishes for the forthcoming Du Vali.

​This inaugural forum is the first “CERA Week” to be held in India, marking a new promising phase of India’s transition to a global economic powerhouse – a New India.

​This premier energy forum also marks a new stage in the growing strategic relationship between OPEC and India, and builds on previous meetings and interactions that we have had so far.

​My friend, Hon. Minister Pradhan, reminded me on Sunday, during our OPEC-India bilateral meeting, that within less than a year, we have already met five times.

​As Secretary General, I visited New Delhi on the occasion of the 2016 Petrotech Conference in December of last year. Along with some of my colleagues from the OPEC Secretariat, we had a series of high-level productive meetings with government and industry leaders.

​We again learnt of India’s solid and steadfast support for the work of the Organization, particularly its ongoing efforts seeking oil market stabilization, and noted its deep appreciation for the value of the ongoing OPEC-India Dialogue.

​This was followed, earlier this year, on the 22nd of May in Vienna, by the 2nd High-level Meeting of the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue. Attended by the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, His Excellency, Dharmendra Pradhan, and joined by Indian oil industry leaders, it built on earlier high-level gatherings in a solid and substantive way.

​The dialogue between OPEC and India – the relationship that we celebrate here today – is rather unique given India’s role as one of the most dynamic countries in the world.

​The oil and gas industry, in particular, is expanding rapidly. It is not only fuelling the country’s vibrant economy, enticing investors and oil producers from near and far. It is also serving as a ‘focal point’ for some of the leading joint projects being undertaken by OPEC’s Member Countries, who recognize India’s unprecedented growth potential.

​Such projects signal India’s rapidly growing importance on the global energy scene.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​India’s economy has been experiencing some of the greatest structural changes in a generation. A slate of bold new reforms, embarked upon under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Modi, has put the country firmly on a sustainable dynamic growth path – particularly when it comes to energy.

​These reforms have included demonetization policy, the goods and services tax (GST), and efforts to diversify the energy mix. They have all been designed to move the country toward sustainable growth and stability.

​Additionally, the country’s expanding middle class represents a growing source of demand – and not just for energy but for goods and services from around the world.

​Comprised of a young and increasingly educated population, India’s middle class is vigorous, fast moving and upwardly mobile – all key elements for long-term sustainable growth.

​In addition, during this period, India is expected to see major growth in the transportation sector, as well as an expansion in exports of numerous goods and services. It has a world-renowned IT sector, which today is one of the leading global start-up hubs for technology companies, as well as a strong services sector and solid manufacturing base.

​India’s role in the global marketplace and its growing involvement in international trading networks are admirable signposts for a country undergoing a great economic transformation.

​At OPEC, we have been paying close attention to these macroeconomic and business trends in India. Some of them shall directly benefit the growing populations of OPEC’s own Member Countries.

​In particular, we have been working to better understand the potential impacts that such beneficial economic changes may have on future oil demand.

​OPEC even sees world oil demand growth increasingly shifting to India.

​We anticipate, in fact, that by 2040, India’s oil demand will increase by more than 150% to 10.1 mb/d from around 4 mb/d currently.

​The country’s total share of global oil demand is also seen rising to over 9% by 2040 from 4% now.

​The data clearly points to expanded energy use, as Minister Pradhan himself has stated recently, which shall include roles for other energy resources as well.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​There are many factors helping to foster, strengthen and support the deepening relationship between OPEC and India. In fact, since 2000, trade between India and OPEC Member Countries has grown substantially.

​In the period from 2000 to 2015, overall imports of India from OPEC Member Countries increased from $2 billion to nearly $140 billion in 2015. OPEC MCs imports from India increased from $5 billion in 2000-2001 to $56 billion by 2015.

​In terms of crude oil, what we see is similarly impressive in terms of growth. India’s total imports have risen to close to 4.3 mb/d in 2016 from around 1.5 mb/d in 2000. Nearly 80% of these total imports came from OPEC Member Countries.

​Underlying all this, of course, is demand, which in India has been remarkable in recent years. Last year, India had the fastest rising oil demand growth in the world, with an increase of close to 340,000 b/d or 8.3%. It is currently the world’s third-largest oil consumer, with continued and sustained growth prospects in the medium- to long-term.

​In the downstream, India is already a major producer and net exporter of refined petroleum products, with output of close to 5 mb/d, according to our latest Monthly Oil Market Report.

​As a large oil consumer, India thus shares with OPEC, and with oil producers and consumers around the world, a common interest in oil market stability on a sustainable basis.

​Along with other oil producers, we have all seen that constructive dialogue and flexible cooperation can play an important role in maintaining stable oil markets.

​The historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ signed by 24 countries demonstrated that, with firm resolve and broad consensus, the instability seen in the oil markets, as well as the sharp contraction of investments in the industry, the multiplier effect that low oil prices have had on deflation, and the acute financial stress of companies and steep reductions in export revenues of producing countries, all of which have characterized the current and most vicious of all oil cycles, could be overcome.

​Given recent data, it is clear that the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC producers to conform to the production adjustments of the ‘Declaration’ have been fruitful and worthwhile. Let me share with you the key oil market highlights from our latest Monthly Oil Market Report:

​The global economic recovery has gained traction. OECD economic growth in the 1H17 was better than expected. Moreover, the good momentum and the potential tax reform in the US, the ongoing dynamic in the Euro-zone and, to some extent, in Japan, solid growth in China and India and an improving situation in Russia are all lifting the growth forecast to 3.6% in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018.

​The global oil demand growth in 2017 is better than expected – to grow at 1.45 mb/d – and the demand outlook for 2018 is anticipated to be quite robust at similar levels – of above 1.4 mb/d.

​The commercial oil stocks in the OECD have continued to fall. At the start of 2017, the OECD stock overhang was at 338 mb above the five-year average. This has since then fallen by 167 mb at a faster pace – by 130 mb alone during the last five months – which was attributed mainly to high conformity levels, above 100%, of participating OPEC and non-OPEC countries, and stronger oil demand in the second half of the year. The overhang in stocks nevertheless stood at 171 mb for the month of August. Of this, 146 mb constitutes crude and 25 mb products, almost converging with the five-year average.

​In addition, floating storage has also been on a declining trend during the first eight months of 2017 and is down by an estimated 40 mb since the start of the year, supported by a narrowing contango. In fact, Brent has flipped into backwardation for the first time since the second half of 2014.

​Just a few days ago, I attended first Russian Energy Week in Moscow, where I shared a speaking platform with President Vladimir Putin, and held talks on oil market developments with Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources and also the President of the OPEC Conference, as well as other OPEC and non-OPEC Ministers, all of whom are part of the historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. The statements reaffirmed the broader commitment to joint action by all for the market stability beyond the short-term.

​We all remain confident that the recent extension of the terms of the ‘Declaration’ – through to early 2018 – is already accelerating the rebalancing process as confirmed by the latest monthly data.

​The oil supply and demand variables are fast returning to balance after a record three years of unprecedented downturn, as evidenced by the continuously positive fundamentals, due largely to the full and timely implementation of supply adjustments by OPEC and non-OPEC countries.

​Emerging from this most vicious of all oil cycles, the need to sustain the rebalanced market in the medium- to long-term, some extra-ordinary measures could be considered by countries participating in ‘the Declaration of Cooperation’, including expanding the membership. This is a shared responsibility of all producers, be they conventional or non-conventional, short- or long-cycle investors. We all, at the end of the day, when all is said and done, belong to the same industry and operate in the same markets. We urge our friends in the shale basins of North America to take this shared responsibility with all the seriousness it deserves, as one of the key lessons learnt from the current, unique supply-driven cycle.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The IOCs, independent oil companies and others have reduced their investments by more than 50% during two consecutive years in 2015 and 2016. However, NOCs have not only weathered the storm from the downturn but have also bravely continued investing across the supply chain. In this way, OPEC will continue to be a dependable and reliable supplier of first choice to rapidly growing countries like India.

​OPEC has a vested interest in the sustained healthy economic growth and prosperity of India.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/158-8-10-october-2017.html"
"2017-09-25","​Excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​Good morning and greetings from the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, Austria.

​Before I begin allow me to take this opportunity to thank S&P Global Platts for this generous invitation to speak at one of Asia's premier oil and gas industry events.

​Even though my schedule did not permit me to travel to Singapore for this prestigious event, which is in its 33rd edition, I am pleased to be able to deliver my remarks to you through this video, which was taped here in our broadcast studio at the OPEC headquarters.

​These observations come at a strategic moment, as just last Friday, we concluded our 5th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, or JMMC, which was set up to monitor the implementation process of the historic Declaration of Cooperation.

​This unprecedented OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation is the fruit of the historic production adjustment decisions that were taken by OPEC and participating non-OPEC producing nations at the end of 2016. In May of 2017, these decisions were extended for an additional nine months until the end of March 2018.

​Thus far in the process, conformity levels among the 24 participating countries in relation to their voluntary production adjustments have been remarkably high, which has sent a clear message to the world that these countries are determined to do what is necessary to bring back sustainable market stability. In fact, for the month of August 2017, the overall conformity level reached a record high of 116%.

​At the conclusion of last Friday’s Ministerial Meeting, the JMMC issued a press release in which it stated that the joint efforts of the OPEC and non-OPEC countries were bearing fruit and that the oil market was on the road to rebalancing.

​We are seeing declining OECD commercial crude inventories, which went down to 170 million barrels above the five-year average in August 2017 from 340 million barrels at the beginning of the year.

​Crude in floating storage is also down by an estimated 40 million barrels since the start of the year, with the support of a narrowing contango, and even signs of backwardation in relation to ICE Brent in Europe.

​These positive developments are good news, not only for our Member Countries, and other non-OPEC producers, but indeed this is equally good news for consumers who rely every day on oil and products to fuel their growing economies.

​Nowhere is this more relevant than in Asia, which is expected to be the engine for future world energy growth due to its expanding economies, rapid population growth, a rising middle class as well as the swift transition to urbanization and industrialization.

​We expect global demand to increase by nearly 16 million barrels a day until 2040 – at which time it could reach around 111 million barrels a day.

​A remarkable 70% of this growth is forecast to come from emerging and developing economies in Asia.

​The two major population growth centres in Asia will be India, which is expected to reach 1.6 billion people by 2040 and China, which will be at 1.4 billion. This amounts to 18% and 16%, respectively, of the entire world population.

​As far as economic expansion goes, Asia will be the engine of growth in the years to come. GDP growth in India and China are estimated at 6.8% per year and 4.7% per year, respectively, over the forecast period up to 2040. And, separately, India and China are expected to see an increase in their combined global share of real GDP from 25% in 2016 to nearly 40% in 2040.

​Expansion at these levels from the fast growing economies in Asia will require supplies from all producing regions, and OPEC Member Countries will surely play an important part in helping meet these increasing needs.

​As refinery capacity grows in the region, larger quantities of crude oil will be required. This can be seen when you look at the latest data on trade flows until the year 2040, as Asia-Pacific imports will expand and the Middle East exports are set to increase. Crude exports from the Middle East to the Asia Pacific region are expected to increase by 7.5 mb/d between 2016 and 2040, rising from 14.5 mb/d to 22 mb/d. So, for the foreseeable future, we can count on the Asia-Pacific region to be the primary outlet for OPEC and Middle Eastern export barrels.

​However, for these growth scenarios to materialize, we will need to see a rebalanced and stable oil market so that industry investment can return to sufficient levels necessary to secure future supply.

​The historic cooperation and determined efforts of OPEC and its non-OPEC partners through the Declaration of Cooperation have clearly placed us on the right path to stability, however we must see all stakeholders in the industry rally to combat volatility and ensure that prices are supported and stabilized for the long term as this is the only way we will be able to restore long-term investment to the required levels again.

​This is something that can only be achieved together through dialogue and cooperation, especially considering the interdependent and integrated nature of today’s global energy market.

​In the previous years, OPEC has been at the forefront of industry dialogue initiatives, and has recently added Asia to its portfolio of meetings.

​In addition to the well-established ongoing energy dialogues with the European Union and the Russian Federation, China and India have been added to the series of dialogues taking place each year, reflecting the importance of the Asian continent to OPEC’s Member Countries.

​The latest such Asian dialogue was held in May of this year, when the second OPEC-India Energy Dialogue was convened at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, providing an opportunity for fruitful discussions on crucial trade relations between OPEC Member Countries and India, and on the important topic of rising energy consumption in India. When you consider that OPEC Member Countries provide an estimated 85% of the crude oil and 90% of the gas going to India, you can see why these discussions would be so relevant. And indeed, these talks are scheduled to continue next year as the next dialogue is planned for 2018 in New Delhi.

​We also look forward to our next OPEC-China Energy Dialogue, which is currently scheduled to take place at the end of this year in Beijing.

​These energy dialogue initiatives have set a very positive precedent for future dialogue between OPEC and its Asian partners, and our hope is that these efforts will evolve into long-term partnerships that will bring benefits to all involved stakeholders.

​Delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

​I am here to confirm that the future outlook for the global oil market is improving with each new day thanks to the ongoing dedicated efforts of the 24 OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries who, through the Declaration of Cooperation, are contributing to the rebalancing of the global oil market. I assure you that if it were not for this noble joint intervention that began last year, the current oil market would not be where it is today.

​Now, looking ahead, we will keep pressing onwards until we reach our common goal of a fully rebalanced, growing and sustainable global oil market.

​I would like to take this opportunity, in closing, to invite all Asian stakeholders to join us in these crucial efforts to restore a sustainable stability to the market so that that OPEC and its non-OPEC partners can continue to ensure a steady supply of oil and gas to help fuel Asia’s future economic growth and provide prosperity for its future generations.

​Thank you for your kind attention, and I wish you all a very successful conference.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/160-25-september-2017.html"
"2017-09-22","​Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the OPEC Secretariat for the fifth meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC).

​I would especially like to recognize and warmly welcome several esteemed gentlemen who join us here for the first time.

​Firstly, I would like to congratulate His Excellency Eng. Eulogio Del Pino on his recent appointment as People’s Minister of Petroleum of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and welcome him to the panel of Ministers of the JMMC.

​Our gratitude and sincere thanks goes to his predecessor, His Excellency Dr. Nelson Martínez, who contributed greatly to past meetings of the JMMC.

​I would also like to welcome His Excellency Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, Nigeria’s Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, His Excellency Mustafa A. Bulgasm Sanalla, Chairman of Libya’s NOC, and Alaa K. Alyasri, the new General Director of Iraq’s SOMO, who is attending this meeting on behalf of his Oil Minister, His Excellency Jabbar Ali Hussein Al-Luiebi. We look forward to hearing their views on developments and plans in their home countries, as well as at the global level.

​It is also an opportune to once again thank the unflagging efforts of the Joint Technical Committee, ably and expertly supported by the OPEC Secretariat, whose input is so important to the process of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. The JTC group met for the eighth time just two days ago, and today we will review their analysis and recommendations. I would like to say to them, please keep up the great work.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Since our last meeting in the beautiful city of St. Petersburg in July, the oil market situation has markedly improved. The market is now evidently well on its way toward rebalancing. There are a number of positives to report.

​The destocking process has accelerated in recent months. The most recent data for August 2017 now shows OECD commercial oil inventories around 170 million barrels above the five-year average. This compares to the beginning of 2017, when the level was 340 million barrels above the five-year average. Moreover, floating storage has declined significantly in recent months.

​I should add here that the catastrophic hurricanes that have hit the US Gulf Coast in recent weeks and the subsequent refinery outages have evidently had some short-term repercussions with risings US stock levels. However, the US energy industry already appears to be rebounding quickly. We offer them, and everyone impacted by the devastating events, our full support as the region recovers.

​We have also witnessed a distinct change in the market structure over the past couple of months, initially with a narrowing contango and more recently when Brent flipped into backwardation. This we believe is a sign of the shrinking stockpiles, as well as stronger demand.

​In fact, the OPEC Secretariat in its most recent Monthly Oil Market Report raised expectations for oil demand in both 2017 and 2018. In addition, only last week the International Energy Agency also increased its estimate for demand growth in 2017 by 100,000 barrels a day.

​In addition, it is important to note that we saw a slight deceleration in expected 2018 non-OPEC supply growth in OPEC’s latest monthly report.

​Alongside these developments we should also place the continuing and unprecedented high conformity levels achieved by the participating OPEC and non-OPEC countries to the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’.

​However, we should not take these developments as a sign to sit back and relax. While we are on the right track and there is a now more light at the end of the tunnel, this is not the time to take our foot off the accelerator. We have more work to do in lowering inventories toward the last five-year average and help return sustainable stability to the market. We cannot be complacent. We cannot lose sight of our key aspirations.

​For all of us here today, this means reviewing recent oil market developments, assessing conformity levels, both collectively and individually, and looking at ways and means to continually improve these levels and the market rebalancing process in the months ahead.

​I think it is important for me to again highlight that some producing countries continue to over-perform, and we should recognize their dedicated and exemplary efforts. What this also underscores is how vital it is for each and every county to reach its own conformity goals. We should be resolute in achieving 100 per cent across the board.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​This Committee has great responsibility, and with this in mind, I am happy to have a very wise man next to me as Alternate Chairman, His Excellency Alexander Novak. His support and guidance at every JMMC meeting has been greatly appreciated.

​We should remember that our actions are being watched closely. We need to remain steadfast and resolute in seeing through this market rebalancing process, in the interests of both producers and consumers, and the global economy as a whole. It is vital in helping to ensure a stable and secure energy future.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/161-22-september-2017.html"
"2017-09-22","Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

It is always a great pleasure to welcome you back to the OPEC Secretariat. I would like to thank you all, both OPEC and non-OPEC delegations alike, for taking the time to attend this 5th Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) today, the first in the Hijrah 1439 and on the first Friday of this blessed year! Your continuous engagement towards fulfilling the objectives of this Committee is essential in order to achieve the full and timely implementation of the decisions taken last year and realise our noble objectives of restoring stability in this beleaguered industry.

I would like to single out and commend our Chairman, HE Issam A. Almarzooq, Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity and Water of Kuwait, and Alternate Chairman, HE Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, for their continued exemplary leadership of the JMMC since its inception at the beginning of the year. Despite the inevitable teething problems that accompany any innovation, the process has been smooth: so far, so good!

The heavy load and tireless work of the Joint Technical Committee, which met for the eighth time two days ago at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, should be acknowledged. You remain the technical power house of the JMMC.

In that regard, I would like to particularly extend my deep appreciation to the two Co-Chairs of the JTC, Haitham Al-Ghais and Pavel Sorokin, for their exceptional dedication, commitment and selfless stewardship. The JMMC and the JTC are key pillars of the implementation of the historic Declaration of Cooperation and, as I remarked at dinner last night, have become the umbilical cord connecting the 24 participating countries.

Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

It seems almost unbelievable that we are about to move into the fourth quarter of 2017, so quickly has this year passed. We have every reason to be pleased with the steady progress we have made in our collective efforts to overcome the challenges of the current oil market cycle – which is worse than all previous cycles.

Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

While the grounds for our cautious optimism regarding the rebalancing process are irrefutable, it is critical we maintain our focus.

We should be in no doubt that the production adjustments that were extended in May 2017 will remain vital to the market rebalancing process in the coming months.

I urge all of us not to be side-tracked from the critical task at hand. We should focus on the now, and ensure that each step we take moves us closer to our stated goal.

With that, I look forward to our deliberations here today.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/162-22-september-2017.html"
"2017-09-11","​Ladies and gentlemen,

​It is a great pleasure to be here this evening, in front of such a learned audience, and of course, in a place of such great learning. It is the oldest university in the English-speaking world; a place renowned for its great scholars, its stimulating intellectual debate and its teaching and research that has produced ideas and visions that have greatly impacted the world we live in.

​Of course, as I am sure we all appreciate, the learning process we face as human beings does not end at university. It is never-ending. One of the many challenges we face as we make our way along this path called ‘life’ is making sure we learn to respond with agility, flexibility and understanding to the changing circumstances of our lives.

​Although we all try to have happy, healthy, and satisfying lives, we also know that, at any moment, life can present us with difficulties, situations, and surprises that could not be foreseen. We then are forced to adapt – to ‘roll with the punches’, so to speak – and thus we acquire strength and resilience.

​The learning process I have just described not only has to do with our personal lives, but with other areas of human activity too – from the cultural to the social, from the political to the economic. It also holds quite true for the energy and oil industry, and those areas in which many of us work.

​Lest you worry that I am going to spend your dinner hour waxing philosophically, I assure you that I am here to speak to you about oil price cycles and recent market challenges. I hasten to add, however, that there are few other places where a consideration of life’s deeper questions would be as welcome as here at Oxford!

​I think it is appropriate to recall for a moment our late friend and colleague Robert Mabro, learned founder of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. It was through his pioneering work and determination that the Institute was started, and it his spirit that continues to inspire the discussions that have been central to this Seminar since it began in 1979. This year is the Seminar’s 39th edition. I fondly recall my first visit to this Seminar back in 1986 and I can honestly say that it has had a positive and lasting impact.

​Robert Mabro, who very sadly passed away last year, was widely respected for his vision, for his deep learning, and for his wit. He was an influence on many of us, including my humble self.

​I met with him on many occasions to brainstorm ideas and to garner advice on my career. He was always friendly and accommodating, open-minded to ideas that might conflict with his own, and willing to offer guidance, both personally and in terms of his views on the global energy landscape.

​In his many writings and talks, Mabro sought to provide a view of the oil market in the 21st century. It is one that many of us have come to recognize today. In fact, his understanding of the central role that oil would have in both industrialised and developing countries was in advance of his peers. In many ways, he was a visionary.

​In a 2005 book, which Mabro edited on behalf of OPEC called ‘Oil in the 21st Century’, he spoke eloquently about some of the future challenges that would face the oil market. He also supported the ongoing idea of developing a dialogue ‘between the various parties of the energy scene’. 

​He was a very early advocate of the producer-consumer and producer-producer dialogue, following the oil price crash in 1986 and his excellent work and analysis on the genesis of this dramatic event. I am pleased to say that at OPEC, we have taken this lesson on dialogue to heart, as recent developments have demonstrated.

​As the 39th edition of this Seminar proceeds with discussions and deliberations, let us remember the important contributions of the late Robert Mabro. We should look to recall the impetus he gave to this annual Seminar, and seek to emulate the vigour and spirit with which he always carried out his work.

​One of the themes that Mabro and other scholars have sought to understand is the role and effects of oil price cycles. Often when people talk of price cycles, they begin with caveats. Price cycles – and stories of violent boom and bust – raise the spectre of long, slow-moving lines at petrol stations. They conjure up scenes of a world of harsh scarcity, with people searching for oil as they do in some dystopian movies. And they can also evoke images of a world awash in cheap oil, with idle pumps and rigs.

​The reality is that price cycles have always been part of the market. They are part of its evolving nature; and as the market dynamics and structures change, so do the characteristics of those price cycles.

​At OPEC, we have conducted research into price cycles and have identified six major price cycles since the early 1970s. For each of these cycles, we have also looked into the monthly periods of losses and gains using the ‘real price’ value of the OPEC Reference Basket.

​This has been a rewarding exercise for us, as it has revealed some interesting similarities among the cycles, as well as some divergences.

​For instance, sometimes it has been the economy driving the price cycle, thus demand has been the primary driver of prices, helping to push them up. Other times, it has been supply, such as with the current cycle, which has served as the primary or fundamental factor. At other times, a combination of supply and demand factors has driven prices.

​Moreover, we also need to recognize that in recent times, non-fundamental factors, such as speculative financial activities, have been a significant factor impacting prices.

​However, despite some existing parallels with previous cycles, the magnitude of the price drop in the current cycle is the highest of all cycles in real terms. In addition, the recent drop in oil prices has been considerably sharper than the decline in prices for other commodities – which is in stark contrast to, for example, the oil price collapse of 1985-1986 when all commodity prices saw a steep decline.

​Regardless of what the exact nature of the drivers is, in all cases extreme prices created boom and bust cycles. These have often had quite negative implications and have contributed to the creation of extremely volatile price environments, which is not in the interest of either producers or consumers.

​We need to remember that low oil prices are bad for producers today and lead to situations that are bad for consumers tomorrow. And high oil prices are bad for consumers today and lead to situations that are bad for producers tomorrow.

​In terms of the current price cycle, the OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80% between June 2014 and January 2016.

​Many producers felt that the circumstances surrounding the recent price cycle had completely overtaken their day-to-day work. It also choked off investments, with exploration and production spending falling by a massive 27% in both 2015 and 2016. The recent price crash led to nearly one trillion dollars in investments being frozen or discontinued, and many thousands of jobs were lost.

​Moreover, it was also a period that saw major stock builds, with the OECD stock overhang increasing to a level of 380 million barrels above the five-year average at the end of July 2016.

​The seriousness of these developments led to OPEC embarking on extensive consultations among OPEC Member Countries and between OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations, which I should stress are ongoing and remain extremely positive, to build consensus about the strategic urgency of rebalancing the global oil market in a collective manner.

​These eventually led to the historic production adjustment decisions reached by OPEC and participating non-OPEC producers at the end of 2016 and then extended in May 2017, for a further period of nine months till the end of March 2018. This has been a major commitment from 24 producing countries as we look to see the return of sustainable market stability.

​There was then, and continues to be now, global recognition that without such adjustments, the market would have experienced further extreme volatility, which would have had far-reaching negative consequences for producers, consumers, investors, the industry, and the global economy at large.

​It is clear that the rebalancing process is underway, supported by the high conformity levels of OPEC Member Countries and participating non-OPEC countries to the production adjustments in the landmark ‘Declaration of Cooperation’. Destocking, both onshore and offshore, is clearly evident.

​The most recent data for July 2017 now shows OECD commercial oil inventories around 195 million barrels above the five-year average, down 145 million barrels from the close to 340 million barrels seen at the beginning of 2017.

​Floating storage has also been on a declining trend since June, supported by a narrowing contango. In fact, Brent has recently flipped into backwardation. As a whole, industry data for 2017 suggest that crude in floating storage has fallen by more than 30 million barrels since the beginning of the year.

​Even in the US, the market saw nine consecutive weeks of crude oil stock draws across the months of July and August. This amounted to a total drawdown of over 51 million barrels.

​It should be noted that the final week of August actually saw a US crude oil stock build of around 4.5 million barrels, although this was to be expected following the refinery outages after the devastating Hurricane Harvey hit Texas and Louisiana.

​Although there has been a relatively quick recovery in shut-in crude oil production, both offshore and onshore, the havoc wrought by Harvey, as well as that of Hurricane Irma, will undoubtedly continue to have implications far beyond the US Gulf Coast for many months. For example, in terms of refinery runs, trade flows, crude and product pricing and short-term oil demand.

​However, the manifold effects, and the varying speed with which recovery of facilities in the region will take place, make it difficult to extrapolate just how its impact will play out on the markets.

​Alongside this positive conformity story and the ongoing destocking process, another optimistic indicator going forward is global oil demand growth. It is estimated to increase by close to 2 million barrels a day from the first to the second half of this year. Undoubtedly this boost in demand will contribute to further reductions in commercial oil inventories.

​It is also important to note that we have recently seen a slight deceleration in non-OPEC supply growth, particularly in some tight oil basins as evidenced recently by falling rig counts.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​I should stress that there does remain a significant concern looking ahead. This is specifically in regard to the level of investments being made.

​While investments are expected to pick up slightly this year and in 2018, it is clear that this is not anywhere close to past levels and it is more evident in short-cycle, rather than long-cycle projects, which are the industry’s baseload. Additionally, we should remember that the actual volume of conventional oil discovered across the globe has halved over the past four years, compared to the previous four-year period.

​As we have all learned from previous price cycles, such pronounced and long-term declines in investments are a serious threat to future supply. But given our projected future demand for oil, the world simply cannot afford a supply crunch. Thus, we need to continue to make every effort to make sure that future supply is not jeopardized. Recognizing and respecting the link between long-term security of supply and short-term conditions is critical. In other words, we all need to work hard for sustainable market stability.

​In fact, OPEC has consistently pointed to the interrelatedness of these two dimensions, and has reminded other producers that addressing them requires close collaboration on the part of both producers and consumers.

​The only way to strive for this market stability is to do so collaboratively, in consultation with other energy stakeholders. We have done so – and, as part of this, we continue to emphasize the need for better information about energy and environmental policies in consuming countries, as well as of energy trends worldwide. Such issues are of common concern and, as such, cannot be pursued in isolation. They require common and collective responses.

​As we discuss these and other issues, perhaps we will find interesting insights to derive from the current situation. But we should remember that it is not the actual finding of a permanent solution to any one challenge that makes us successful.

​Rather, it is the way we act and respond to each and every new challenge, and the way we work together and collaborate, that will really determine whether we have learned anything from the late Robert Mabro’s vast learning, collaborative nature and generous spirit.

​And of course this spirit continues with those that carry on his work through this Seminar: Mr. Nader Sultan, Professor Louise Fawcett, Dr. Bassam Fattouh, and our host for the evening, Professor Roger Ainsworth, to name just a few.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/163-11-september-2017.html"
"2017-07-24","Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen: Good morning. It is a pleasure to be back in St. Petersburg, and I would like to thank His Excellency Alexander Novak both for hosting this gathering and for his tireless efforts and strong support for the effective cooperation between OPEC and key non-OPEC producers—including, of course, the Russian Federation.

I also want to acknowledge the efforts of the Joint Market Monitoring Committee under the leadership of the Minister of Oil and Minister of Electricity & Water of Kuwait, His Excellency Issam A. Almarzooq; the contributions of the Joint Technical Committee; and the work of the OPEC Secretariat and His Excellency Mohammad Barkindo. I would note that at our last meeting in May, delegates agreed to expand the mandate of the JMMC to continue to monitor levels of conformity and make additional recommendations, if necessary, in light of changing market conditions.

Since that last gathering, we have witnessed continued pressure on the market, underpinned uncertainty about supply-demand developments. Before addressing those doubts, however, let me first mention three critical positive trends going forward:

In my view, these trends will continue to chip away at the inventory overhang, so it is only a matter of time before inventories return toward more normal levels, further strengthening global markets.

Despite the positive indicators I just mentioned, we must acknowledge that the market has turned bearish with several key factors driving this behavior: reported compliance not matching export figures, increased Libyan and Nigerian production, US shale forecasts, and finally the outlook past the March 2018 expiry date of our agreement.

In terms of compliance, we have put in place a robust monitoring mechanism, comprising the joint monitoring and technical committees which rely on production reports from secondary sources. In our discussions we will review the report of the Joint Technical Committee, which has examined the implementation of last year’s production decisions and how this has impacted stock levels.

Although conformance with the production agreement remains strong at the aggregate level, some countries continue to lag—which is a concern we must address head-on. In addition, exports have now become the key metric for financial markets, and we need to find a way to reconcile credible export data with production data and our monitoring mechanism.

The other major issue that markets are focused on is the expansion of supplies from Nigeria and Libya, both of which have been exempted from our agreement, and of course we remain supportive of our partners in both of those nations as they work on the recovery of their industries and economies. The committee, however, should monitor the impact of such growth on global supply-demand balances.

Looking at US tight oil, while the drilling rig count and production growth accelerated in the last few months with the recovery in oil prices, the sharp rate of increase in rig levels has already started to ease significantly. There are many factors at play, including rising costs, declining well productivity, and the movement of production to less prolific acreage and more marginal wells.

Let me also comment briefly on the 2018 outlook, where demand growth forecasts made by various institutions range between 1.4 and 1.6 million bpd. This compares to US crude oil production growth of 600,000 barrels per day predicted by the US Energy Information Administration. This means that after accounting for shale growth there will be a net of between 800,000 and one million barrels per day of demand to be met by other producers.

In summary, ladies and gentlemen, let me stress that the historical collaboration and cohesion among the OPEC and non-OPEC members remains exemplary in spite of the headwinds we are facing, and our united stance amid a complex market environment will continue to play the most important role in shaping market sentiment.

Today, all the key variables—the global economy, demand growth, marginal supply trends, supply-demand balances, and inventories—are improving, and we look forward to healthier market conditions in the weeks and months to come. However, market dynamics are complex and are constantly changing and developing. Therefore, we should continue to monitor the situation closely and jointly take further actions as appropriate to ensure a balanced market.

Finally, let me reiterate that both OPEC members and non-OPEC nations have acted in unison, and for that I would like to give special credit to the JMMC led by our able co-chairs and to my colleagues on the committee. And once more, thanks to His Excellency Minister Novak for hosting us today.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/164-24-july-2017.html"
"2017-07-24","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning to you all.

​I would like to welcome you to the fourth meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and start by thanking you all for accepting our invitation to attend this meeting.

​It is an absolute pleasure to be in the beautiful and historical city of St. Petersburg. I would like to thank our Russian hosts, especially His Excellency, Alexander Novak, Russia’s Minister of Energy, for the wonderful hospitality shown in facilitating this meeting. Aside from being a gracious host, Minister Novak is to be commended as he has once again reaffirmed his commitment to this committee by continuing to serve as Alternate Chairman.

​I hope you all have an opportunity to enjoy this great city. Given St. Petersburg’s cultural heritage there are a multitude of points of interest for you to explore.

​Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen,

​Please permit me to take you back to the key milestones that have led to the unprecedented and innovative cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries.

​The JMMC was established following OPEC’s 171st Ministerial Conference decision of 30 November 2016 and the subsequent historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ made at the joint OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting of 10 December 2016. At these meetings, 11 non-OPEC oil producing countries cooperated with the 13 OPEC Member Countries in an effort to accelerate the stabilization of the global oil market through adjustments in oil production of around 1.8 million barrels per day.

​In support of this historic cooperation, this Committee, which concluded its inaugural meeting on 22 January at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, put together a framework of monitoring mechanisms. Part of that framework included the creation of a Joint Technical Committee – the JTC – which met for the sixth time two days ago, on the 22 July, here in St. Petersburg. The mandate of the JTC was to produce, with the support of the Secretariat, a monthly report updating the JMMC on the status of the implementation process.

​At the last meeting of the JMMC on May 24 2017, our committee, having considered market conditions and global inventory levels, concluded that it was necessary to extend the production adjustments. The committee also recommended that the duration of the anticipated extension should be longer than the originally envisaged period in the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ of six months. Having discussed various scenarios presented by the JTC with regard to the extension of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’, the JMMC recommended that the production adjustments of the participating countries should be extended for nine months, commencing July 1 2017.

​The 172nd Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the 2nd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting of May 25, 2017, decided to adopt the recommendations of our Committee. Furthermore, at these meetings it was agreed to expand the mandate of the JMMC to continue to monitor conformity, evaluate market developments and make appropriate recommendations, if deemed necessary.

​While our meeting today is the first since the extension of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ and expansion of our mandate, our core tasks remain the same, namely ensuring that the objectives of the Ministerial Conference decision and the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ are achieved through the successful implementation of voluntary adjustments in production. Furthermore, we remain committed to joint cooperation for the achievement of a lasting stability in the oil market – in the interest of oil producers, consumers and the industry.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Today, we convene to consider the latest report issued by the JTC and the OPEC Secretariat. We will then discuss the best plan of action necessary to ensure that we achieve our common goals. The comprehensive report of the JMMC will not only contain the monthly data input, but also the Secretariat’s oil market analysis.

​I would like to thank the OPEC Secretariat for their staunch efforts and commitment over the past months to support the work of the implementation process through this JMMC and the JTC in the lead-up to today’s deliberations. Furthermore, I would like to thank the JTC for its dedicated efforts to date, and for the very substantive and extended reports it has been providing to us.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The implementation of the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ for the first six months of 2017 saw conformity levels unprecedented in the history of OPEC. This is a convincing demonstration of the willingness of all participating countries to continue their cooperation until the set goal of returning the stock overhang to the five-year average is achieved.

​The high conformity levels have played their part in contributing to an absolute reduction in the overhang of OECD commercial stocks of 90 million barrels so far this year. In terms of the latest monthly numbers, total OECD commercial oil stocks in June fell by 15 million barrels compared to May.

​It should be acknowledged that some producing countries have over-performed, and they certainly merit recognition for their dedicated efforts. Without their exemplary performance, we certainly would not have seen such high conformity levels. Therefore, allow me to offer my deep appreciation to all those countries for conforming beyond expectation. I hope their excellent performance will motivate other producing countries to reach their own goals – and perhaps to even surpass them.

​I think now is an opportune moment to remind all of us, individually and collectively, to remain focused and not lose sight of our aspirations. Despite the progress achieved, I would like to warn against complacency and stress the absolute paramount importance of staying the course and striving to achieve better levels of conformity over the next nine months.

​While stock levels have been falling, with a quickening in further weeks, it is important to stress that OECD stocks remain 250 million barrels above the five-year average. Higher supply in North America and an abundance of light crude in the market complicate the fundamentals and these excess volumes will take some time to clear.

​Crude oil prices also remain volatile, with Brent prices dropping over $9 from the last meeting of the JMMC to June 21, before witnessing a generally rising trend in the period since. We need stability to return to the market, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​I would like to emphasize the need for patience and perseverance. As the old saying goes, ‘Rome wasn’t built in a day’. The extension of the Declaration of Cooperation is for nine months and it began to take effect on 1 July. Today is the 24 July. There are a total of 274 days in these nine months, therefore, we have not even seen 9% of that time elapse. We need to redouble and focus our efforts as we have 91% of the course still to see out!

​Furthermore, the seasonal impact of demand on our production adjustments needs to be taken into consideration. Additional progress remains in sight as world oil market prospects bode well for the second half of 2017. Global oil demand is estimated to increase by close to two million barrels per day from the second to the third quarter this year. The US, in particular, is expected to be responsible for a significant amount of this growth as demand for transportation fuels rises in the summer driving season. Undoubtedly this boost in demand will contribute to further reductions in commercial oil inventories.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Each of us is looking forward to the day when investments once again return to healthy levels, and the world economy is strong and robust. This will be well-served if we do our work – and the long-term deepening of ties and ongoing cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries will go a long way to supporting such goals.

​I would like to thank you all for your attention. I will now give the floor over to His Excellency Alexander Novak, Co-Chairman of the JMMC.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/165-24-july-2017.html"
"2017-05-31","​Introduction

​Your Excellencies, Alexander Novak, Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

​It is a delight to be in Moscow, and a great pleasure to attend this High-level Meeting of the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue. The fact that this meeting is being convened for a sixth time underscores the continuing importance of the strategic and tactical relations between Russia and OPEC.

​The role of Russia

​I would like to thank His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, and his staff for hosting today’s meeting. Russia and the OPEC Member Countries share many common interests, hold many of the same views and confront many of the same challenges, and this Dialogue provides a platform to compare notes on both short and long-term issues in the global oil market, while deepening relations at both the technical and ministerial levels.

​As you know, much of the impetus for the present level of cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC members came from talks between Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation that began roughly a year ago, culminating in an agreement between the two countries announced on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in China last September.

​Today, that bilateral commitment is stronger than ever: in fact, just yesterday His Excellency Minister Novak and I attended a meeting of the Saudi and Russian leadership at the Kremlin, during which both our nations renewed their determination to rebalance the global crude oil market in the interest of greater market stability—and restated our commitment to doing whatever it takes, together with other like-minded producers, to attain those goals.

​Recent successes

​Of course, yesterday’s discussion and today’s dialogue here in Moscow follow a number of major market developments over the past year. Ten months ago, we were faced with major uncertainty, with excess supplies and inventories on a generally rising trend.

​As a result, market sentiment was distinctly pessimistic, and investment flows were drying up. But, since that time, the OPEC decision in Algiers last year, followed by the collaboration between OPEC and a number of key non-OPEC producers, Russia chief amongst them, has delivered outstanding results.

​For example, since the beginning of this year, OECD commercial stocks have seen an absolute reduction of 31 million barrels, while floating storages have declined by some 30 million barrels during that same period—and with the extension of the Declaration of Cooperation, we can expect further inventory drawdowns.

​Furthermore, following two consecutive years of decreased global E&P investments—when since 2014 there has been a decline in investments of roughly 40 per cent—investments have stabilized this year at 530 billion dollars. This stabilization is attributed to the presence of clear market leadership and the expectation of a balanced market in the near future, given the cooperative actions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

​In short, we have made tremendous progress in rebalancing the market and giving the market strong direction through our determined actions and high degree of conformity.

​But our joint deliberations with Russia concluded that while the rebalancing goal is on its way to being achieved, more needed to be done to draw inventories toward the five-year average.

​This set the stage for the successful meetings held last week in Vienna, where 24 nations comprising both OPEC and non-OPEC producers demonstrated the cohesion and consensus that the markets needed to see by extending the Declaration of Cooperation by nine months. This was a major achievement, in which we can all justifiably take pride.

​A look forward

​If we look ahead, we see four key drivers at play in the market: (1) robust oil demand growth, supported by an improving global economy; (2) the natural decline in legacy fields; (3) the impacts of investment cuts of roughly a trillion dollars over the past two years and the continued lag in sizeable investments in long-term projects, as opposed to shorter-term incremental investments; and (4) the new dynamic of cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, to keep markets in balance.

​When these four factors are taken together, I can only conclude that the supplies coming from marginal barrels, including shale production, will not be sufficient to meet the future need for incremental capacity. The market balance is already pointing in that direction, and in my view, this trend will only strengthen in the coming two years.

​That said, the challenge requiring our greatest attention remains bringing crude oil inventories down toward the five-year average.

​All in all, however, I am confident that the high level of cooperation we have seen among producers over the last six months will remain strong, and that by acting in solidarity and in pursuit of our common objective, we can steadily overcome the inventory challenge.

​Russia-OPEC partnership

​Of course, the partnership between Russia and OPEC is important to both strengthening market fundamentals and giving the market much needed confidence, which is why I place a great value on our cooperation.

​Here I would like to once again acknowledge the outstanding role played by His Excellency Alexander Novak in building and nurturing this relationship, in encouraging our ongoing dialogue, and in enhancing the spirit of collaboration and cooperation.

​Long-term objectives

​Furthermore, I believe the high degree of cooperation between OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers opens new avenues to achieve other critical long-term objectives.

​First and foremost is the key partnership and collaboration theme in OPEC’s future vision that I outlined upon assuming its Presidency early in the year. We want to institutionalize the goal of maintaining and strengthening critical cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, while also fostering and extending excellent relations with international energy institutions to promote better understanding. OPEC has a fundamental interest in the health of the global economy and the worldwide energy industry, to ensure that appropriate levels of investment are maintained and technological progress continues to be encouraged and nurtured.

​I believe we also now have a golden opportunity to expand our cooperation to other areas of mutual interest. For example, major holders of hydrocarbon resources should join hands and assist in formulating a balanced strategy that concurrently meets the goals of climate protection and sustainability while meeting long-term energy demand and spreading economic prosperity.

​Conclusion

​Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude by saying that the strong relationship created between the Russian Federation and OPEC has produced outstanding results by turning an uncertain market into one that can look toward the future with confidence.

​This partnership has been and will continue to be beneficial for the global markets, for the global economy, and for all of the nations involved. In this spirit, I look forward to an engaging event today, and I foresee many opportunities to continue and enhance our joint efforts in the months and years to come.

​Thank you, and spaseebo.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/166-31-may-2017.html"
"2017-05-31","Excellencies,
Distinguished delegates of the Russian Federation,
Ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to be back in the beautiful and historic city of Moscow for this sixth High-level Meeting of the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue.

First of all, allow me to thank his Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, and his staff for hosting this meeting here today and for his continued support of this dialogue.

As HE Khalid A. Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources and President of the OPEC Conference, mentioned in his introductory remarks, the OPEC and Russia Energy Dialogue evolved in the latter years of last decade, and I personally attended the sixth Russian Oil and Gas Week in October 2006.

Our high-level meeting here today, the sixth edition to date, started in 2012, and HE Novak has been present at every meeting since its formal inception. Indeed, he has been personally engaged to strengthen the Dialogue through a more formal structure and an increasing depth in content. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to your Excellency for your visionary contributions to this process and for ensuring that a forward looking perspective always prevails.

Excellency, we have also witnessed your dedicated leadership and constructive and flexible approach on behalf of the Russian Federation to the ongoing joint efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC countries to achieve the rebalancing of the global oil market through the implementation of the Declaration of Cooperation.

In the wake of this resounding achievement as manifested at last week’s large gathering of the 2nd OPEC and Non-OPEC Producing Countries’ Ministerial Meeting, we are now spurred on to go even further as we continue to work together with our non-OPEC partners to lay the groundwork for an increasingly stable, healthy and growing global oil market.

Excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

These annual dialogue meetings have proven to be very effective in providing a common platform for increased understanding and collaboration through the sharing of our respective energy outlooks and viewpoints on the industry.

The fifth High-level Meeting of this Dialogue took place in October of 2016 in Vienna. In addition to exchanging our respective outlooks on the short, medium and long-term oil market, an in-depth discussion took place on price volatility and the impact the high level of stocks were having on the industry.

In the concluding joint statement, the Parties stressed the importance of ongoing cooperation through high-level meetings, such as this one, but also through the well-established technical meetings, which are important venues to discuss pertinent issues affecting the industry.

In their Declaration of Cooperation in December 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC Ministers also underscored the importance of enhancing dialogue and cooperation through the establishment of regular technical expert meetings. The first such meeting was held on 19 May 2017 at the OPEC Secretariat with the objective to strengthen and institutionalize joint cooperation at both the technical and ministerial levels. The first session was dedicated to the developments in the US tight oil industry with in-depth briefings by international industry experts. In the closed session, the OPEC Secretariat gave presentations on the latest short and medium-term oil market developments, which were followed by discussions among the participating delegates.

The success of this meeting has paved the way towards a new framework for permanent and long-standing cooperation among oil producing countries, including the regular practice of joint research activities.

Excellencies, delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

As I alluded to earlier, we have just completed a marathon round of meetings in Vienna, where the OPEC and non-OPEC countries have agreed to continue working together as part of the Declaration of Cooperation in order to ensure that we achieve a balanced market sooner rather than later.

To get there, we will need to see the continued joint efforts of the OPEC and participating non-OPEC nations, which, thus far, have proven to be effective and have led to signs of market rebalancing and a generally more positive mood in terms of market sentiment. HE Alexander Novak and HE Khalid A. Al-Falih both alluded to these historic decisions and how they took us one step closer to our goal of re-establishing a balanced market.

And, now, with the last week’s decision of the OPEC and non-OPEC countries to continue their cooperative efforts, we have seen further momentum in the right direction, indicating a steady re-balancing of the market.

We all know the benefits this will bring to stakeholders across the industry: a stable and growing oil market, a healthy, robust and expanding world economy and security of oil supply to future generations. This is something worth fighting for.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Looking at the agenda, we will have the opportunity today to share our respective outlooks on short, medium and long-term oil market developments and then engage in discussions on these issues. In addition, we will have an in-depth look at two very important themes that will be crucial to our goals of achieving a balanced oil market—non-OPEC supply prospects for 2017 and 2018, as well as road transportation and technology.

We will also look into future activities in terms of conducting a joint study on a selected pertinent theme of mutual interest, whereas the findings of the research undertaking could be presented and further discussed in a roundtable with a broader participation of OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries within the framework of the Declaration of Cooperation – consistent with the recommendations of the first technical meeting of OPEC and Non-OPEC Producing Countries held two weeks ago (19 May 2017).

In closing, allow me to say that we very much look forward to today’s deliberations. I am confident that this meeting will be enriched by the insights and experiences of everyone here as we look to further enhance this dialogue, and explore ways and means to work collectively to bring about the sustainable market stability we all desire.

Thank you for your attention.

"2017-05-25","​Your Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen: Good afternoon. I would like to begin by welcoming you all to the OPEC Secretariat for the 2nd OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting.

​This is another landmark meeting and we are truly pleased to see Ministers and other Heads of Delegation from non-OPEC producing countries joining us.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​You will recall that our first historical joint meeting was held last December, and was co-chaired by my dear friend, His Excellency Dr. Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Minister of Energy and Industry of Qatar. He was joined by another good friend, His Excellency Alexander Novak, Oil Minister of the Russian Federation, who also kindly agreed to serve as co-chair today.

​That meeting produced the landmark Declaration of Cooperation and followed an OPEC Conference decision reached some two months earlier in Algiers, which took place at a challenging time when the market was impacted by a large inventory overhang.

​Our joint Declaration in December was welcomed by the market and, in my view, has played an important role in moving the market toward stability. In the absence of the agreement, the markets would have remained aimless.

​You will recall that a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee and a Technical Committee, both with representatives from OPEC and non-OPEC countries, were also established to more effectively implement the agreement and achieve concrete results.

​These support bodies have continuously examined oil market data and production levels by signatory countries. In doing so, they have informed, guided and enhanced the work intended by the countries who are signatories to the Declaration. The results of their work are in front of all to see, and I would like to thank all those involved for their contributions.

​The goal of accelerating rebalancing has been partially achieved and the market in my opinion is on its way to full recovery. The drawdown of inventories has clearly begun and I expect this trend to accelerate as we enter the high demand season and continue our high conformity levels.

​However, to bring the inventories to the average trend of the last five years, more time is needed.

​In fact, the most important task at this meeting is to consider the extension of the supply agreement to ensure that we bring inventories to the targeted levels, and thus achieve sustained market stability. The entire world is watching our gathering with great anticipation.

​Our delegates and representatives have shown great commitment, admirable flexibility and an understanding of the importance of compromise, and therefore we look forward to further successful collaboration as we consider how to maintain and strengthen current efforts.

​We are also determined to deepen the institutionalization of the framework for cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries, which can help to improve our common adaptation to future market cycles. The oil industry is cyclical by nature, but with regular interactions at both the policy and technical levels, and by working together toward common goals, we can help promote healthy markets. This would be beneficial not only to our respective countries but to the entire petroleum industry, and indeed to consumers and the global economy as a whole. 

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​We have an exceptional opportunity to further strengthen the foundation of cooperation between both OPEC and non-OPEC, and to build more robust mechanisms to collaborate for the benefit of all. I look forward to working with each of you to realize these opportunities today and in the future.

​Thank you for your attention this afternoon.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/168-25-may-2017.html"

"2017-05-22","Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,
Good morning.

On behalf of the OPEC Secretariat, I would like to begin by welcoming HE Dharmendra Pradhan, Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, India, and his team to the OPEC Secretariat for today’s second High-level meeting of the OPEC–India Energy Dialogue.

It is a great pleasure for our Organization to repay the hospitality afforded to my predecessor as Secretary General, HE Abdalla Salem El-Badri, and the OPEC delegation that were in New Delhi for the first meeting of this dialogue back in December 2015.

I can also personally recall the extremely warm welcome I received from Your Excellency when I spoke at the Petrotech conference in New Delhi in December 2016, as well as your valued support for OPEC’s oil market stabilization measures.

This morning I have also spent some time with the Minister discussing the current state of the oil and energy markets, the upcoming OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial meetings later this week in Vienna, as well as the ambitions we both have for this extremely important energy dialogue.

It is easy to appreciate the value and substance of this dialogue, particularly when looking at the ever-expanding relationship between India and OPEC’s Member Countries.

Since 2000, trade between India and OPEC has grown substantially. India’s overall imports from OPEC Member Countries increased from just over $4 billion to a high of above $170 billion in 2012, before dropping slightly in recent years. And in the other direction, OPEC’s total imports from India increased from just under $4 billion in 2000 to over $60 billion in 2014.

Moreover, there are a large number of Indian citizens contributing to the workforce of a number of OPEC Member countries and sending remittances back home, further adding to the close economic ties.

In terms of crude oil, India’s total imports have risen from around 1.5 mb/d in 2000 to close to 4.3 mb/d in 2016. And close to 80% of this came from OPEC Member Countries. In fact, in 2016 India was the fasted oil demand nation globally, with an increase of close to 340,000 b/d, or 8.3%.

India is currently the third-largest oil consumer in the world, and to support this it continues to look to expand both its upstream and downstream sectors.

Your Excellency, I recall hearing your comments from CERA Week in March this year announcing a new round of bidding for upstream and downstream investments and the encouragement you gave to existing and new players to come forward to avail the opportunities in India. I have no doubt that OPEC Member Countries will have heard this call for investments and potential partnerships in a vibrant and expanding market like India.

I should add that in the downstream, it is clear that India is already a major producer and net exporter of refined products, with output of close to 5 mb/d. This is something that India should be extremely proud of.

This also underscores the global interdependence of the oil industry, and by extension, the world.

The economy of India has grown steadily since the beginning of the century, and today it is the sixth-largest economy in the world measured by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).

Looking ahead, India will continue on its path to becoming a global economic powerhouse. It has a young, dynamic and expanding population, much like those of OPEC Member Countries, with a strong services sector, a world-renowned IT sector, which today is one of the leading global start-up hubs for technology companies, and a solid manufacturing base.

In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook, we estimate that India’s economy will grow at an average annual rate of 6.9% for the period 2015-2040. Real GDP is expected to surpass OECD Europe by 2034, and by 2040, it is anticipated to be about the same size as OECD America.

Economic growth, an expanding population, as well as increasing urbanization, will clearly foster major growth in the transportation sector. And India will no doubt continue to expand its exports of a variety of goods and services, with the growing populations of OPEC Member Countries benefitting from India’s exports and trade.

There is huge potential. And to meet this potential will require the use of a variety of energy resources; oil, gas, coal, hydropower, nuclear and renewables. I know from my talks with the Minister that India values a diverse energy mix.

From the perspective of oil, demand growth will increasingly shift to India. By 2040, India’s oil demand is anticipated to increase by over 150%, from around 4 mb/d presently to 10.1 mb/d by then. Its total share of global oil demand will rise from 4%, to over 9% by 2040.

With OPEC home to over 80 per cent of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, and with many of its Member Countries well-positioned for exports to India, it is clear that this relationship will expand further.

Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

Given that this is the week of the OPEC Ministerial meeting, as well as the one between OPEC and some non-OPEC nations, I feel it is appropriate to highlight how the landmark decisions taken last year are helping rebalance the market, and how important they are to the sustainable stability we all desire to help secure our long-term energy future.

The historic decisions taken at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algiers, on September 28, 2016, the 171st Ministerial Conference in Vienna on November 30, 2016, and the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Vienna on December 10, 2016 were undertaken with commitment, courage and compromise.

The voluntary production adjustments of the 24 producing nations represented in these decisions were focused on the urgent need to stimulate the acceleration of the drawdown of the stock overhang, bring the market rebalancing forward and ensure that much needed confidence and investments return to the industry.

Support for these decisions came not only from producers, but consumers too. It was evident that there was a broad international recognition about the strategic urgency of restoring sustainable oil market stability in a collective manner.

Since these decisions we have seen much positive sentiment return to the market, although it has been evident that there have been some blips along the way. We need to appreciate that the market rebalancing was never going to occur in a linear fashion. There are too many factors at play.

Nonetheless, we are heading in the right direction.

The overall level of conformity to the voluntary production adjustments from the participating OPEC and non-OPEC nations has been high.

Inventory levels are falling. Total OECD commercial oil stocks in April fell by 12 mb, the third consecutive monthly drop. The overall level is 253 mb above the latest five-year average, compared to 282 mb in March and 329 mb in February.

Moreover, we are also seeing numbers from industry stating that crude in floating storage has fallen by over 40 mb since the beginning of the year.

Outside of the US, we believe the global trend of destocking is broadly on track. The US has evidently not been reflective of the rest of the world, given rising production there in the first quarter of 2017, but even here the market has now witnessed six consecutive weekly crude stock draws as refinery utilization has risen.

In terms of where we view this process today, to put it simply – we are seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.

And let me reassure you that OPEC and participating non-OPEC nations remain steadfast and resolute in seeing through this market rebalancing process, in the interests of both producers and consumers, and the global economy as a whole. It is vital in helping to ensure a stable and secure energy future.

Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

Today’s agenda sees topics covering the short-, medium- and long-terms, potential crude and gas supply cooperation between OPEC and India, and in the technical meeting that follows this afternoon, there is a specific focus on the Asia-Pacific and India, with topics highlighting transportation and petrochemical sectors, as well as energy and climate change policies.

At OPEC, we truly value the advancement of cooperation and we believe that today’s meetings will strongly reinforce the OPEC-India Energy Dialogue. Looking ahead, we hope to further evolve our relationship and allow us to turn ideas into concrete actions that benefit both Parties.

With that, I look forward to today’s deliberations.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/170-22-may-2017.html"
"2017-04-27","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to return to Paris for this 18th edition of the International Oil Summit. I would like to thank the organizers of this prestigious event for the invitation, and to the Chair of the session, Mr. Claude Mandil, for his introductory remarks. Mr. Mandil was actually Executive Director of the IEA when I was Acting for the OPEC Secretary General back in 2006. It is a pleasure to be on a panel with you again.

I would also like to thank my colleagues here from the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) who ensure that this session has an impressive line-up of speakers.

My great friend, HE Dr. Sun Xiansheng, the Secretary General of the IEF, actually assumed his position at the IEF on the same day I took up my position as OPEC Secretary General, back on August 1, 2016. I have seen firsthand Dr. Sun’s energy, commitment and dedication to advancing and strengthening the producer-consumer dialogue. He should be lauded for the initiatives he has already taken to further enhance the role of the IEF, including the last OPEC-IEA-IEF Energy Outlooks Symposium held in Riyadh, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which was a great success.

And from the IEA, there is Mr. Keisuke Sadamori, the Director of the Energy Markets and Security Division. My colleagues at OPEC speak very highly of the work you have been undertaking at the IEA, and I look forward to engaging with you on this panel.

[SLIDE 2 – Disclaimer]
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

[SLIDE 3]
I have been asked to share with you today, OPEC’s views on the current oil market conditions. In this regard, I feel that it is important to initially take stock as to the current state of the oil market.

This includes a brief overview of the historic decisions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC last year, what has happened to the market since the decisions were agreed, where we are today in terms of the rebalancing process, and perhaps the trickiest question of all: what is potentially ahead of us?

In the second half of last year, OPEC embarked on the most extensive consultations among OPEC Member Countries and between OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations, as well as with consumers and the broader international community about the strategic urgency of restoring sustainable oil market stability in a collective manner.

These extensive consultations, both formal and informal, across various global capitals, were unparalleled in the history of OPEC.

There was a consensus that stability on a sustainable basis had eluded the industry since the summer of 2014, to the detriment of all industry stakeholders.

It is easy to appreciate why there was a consensus. The effects of the price crash that began in mid-2014 were unprecedented.

[SLIDE 4]
Between June 2014 and January 2016 the OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an extraordinary 80%. It is the largest percentage fall in the six episodes of sharp price declines we have observed over the past four decades.

It also led to thousands upon thousands of jobs being lost, many projects cancelled or deferred, investments frozen or discontinued, with a dramatic contraction in investments in both 2015 and 2016, and many companies seeing great financial and operational stresses.

It was clear to everyone we spoke to that the oil industry could not continue along this path. Moreover, it was not only impacting short-term developments, but the medium- and long-term outlooks too, given the fact that the world will need more oil in the decades ahead. The bleeding had to be stopped.

At this juncture, allow me to recall the atmosphere at this Summit back on 21 April 2016. In conversations with colleagues that were in attendance I heard expressions of bearish sentiment, a sense of foreboding about the industry’s near-term future, and little talk of industry expansion and investment. The prevalent feeling was gloomy and downbeat.

There was also no clear direction, despite the efforts made at the Doha-1 meeting in February 2016, between Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Russia, and the Doha-2 meeting in April 2016, with around 20 OPEC and non-OPEC producers present, as to how the industry might overcome the downturn that had begun in mid-2014, and in turn, rebalance supply and demand. Producers, both OPEC and non-OPEC, had lost their compass and direction!

Total OECD commercial oil stocks in April 2016 were around 350 mb above the five-year average, and expectations were for them to continue to rise. They reached 380 mb in July 2016. WTI and Brent combined net-long positions were at 620,000 contracts in mid-April, with a pessimistic market outlook among traders for the coming months. WTI and Brent combined net-long positions fell to below 400,000 contracts by mid-August. And the average ICE Brent price in the first four months of 2016 was around $30/b, compared to an average so far in 2017 of $52/b.

I think it is important to appreciate what fundamentals might look like today without the decisions taken last year being effectively put into action. The market would no doubt look very different – more unstable, more volatile, and with far less optimism, with continued negative impacts on all stakeholders.

[SLIDE 5]
The extensive consultations that began in August 2016 were undertaken with commitment, great diligence and rare courage that facilitated flexibility, accommodation and compromise among the respective parties. These eventually led to the landmark decisions taken at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algiers, on September 28, 2016, the 171st Ministerial Conference in Vienna on November 30, 2016, and the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers in Vienna on December 10, 2016.

The decisions meant that for the first time in the history of the industry, 13 OPEC nations and 11 non-OPEC participating countries came together as strategic stakeholders, to help rescue and stabilize the global oil industry – one that has been vital to the development of modern civilization.

The voluntary production adjustments of the 24 producing nations were focused on the urgent need to stimulate the acceleration of the drawdown of the stock overhang, bring the market rebalancing forward and ensure that much needed confidence and investments return to the industry.

[SLIDE 6]
Following these landmark decisions, it was evident that market optimism began to improve.

OPEC’s watershed decision in Algiers to agree on a production ceiling of 32.5 to 33 mb/d, the first production adjustment since the ‘Oran Decision’ of 2008, saw an immediate return of positive sentiment, albeit with some cautious optimism. There was a rise in net long-positions and a narrowing of the contango.

The timely decision in Algiers on 28 September 2016, in the spirit of collectiveness and flexibility, with three Member Countries accorded special circumstances, also extended the hand of unity to non-OPEC producers to broaden the global platform of voluntary production adjustments. It was vintage OPEC at work!

Market optimism advanced again following OPEC’s decision on November 30. This can be observed by the fact that WTI and Brent combined net-long positions increased from close to 500,000 contracts on November 29, 2016, to 763,000 on January 3, 2017.

This sentiment further improved in the early part of 2017, particularly following the high level of conformity to the voluntary production adjustments seen in January. For this month, OPEC and non-OPEC nations achieved a conformity level of 86%, which certainly seemed to surprise the market to the upside. WTI and Brent combined net-long positions reach 921,000 contracts on February 21, an additional rise of 21% from January 3.

It was a period of lower volatility, and more stability in oil prices.

However, despite the expectation of improved levels of conformity in February, which proved to be true, with overall conformity at 94%, we saw a turn in market sentiment in early March, with financial players significantly reducing their net-long positions.

It is important to stress that this development was not totally unexpected. The first quarter of every year has a number of seasonal trends that can soften the market.

The first quarter is a period when significant levels or refinery throughput in the US is often shut-in. In January and February this year, 1 mb/d of throughput was shut down for maintenance. For these two months, this equates to approximately 60 million barrels.

On top of this, in previous months we have also seen rising production from a number of non-OPEC nations, particularly in the US from tight oil, reflecting expectations for much greater quantities to come from non-OPEC in 2017.

For example, in the January 2017 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report, non-OPEC supply was anticipated to grow by 120,000 b/d in 2017. In the April report, this number had risen to 580,000 b/d, driven mainly by expectations for rising growth in the US, as well as in Canada and Brazil.

In the US alone, expectations for 2017 were for a decline of 150,000 b/d back in the November 2016 report, while in the April report it is now estimated to grow by 540,000 b/d.

In addition, it is important to remember that the fourth quarter of 2016 was a period of significantly rising supplies that were working their way through the market in the early part of 2017. Non-OPEC increased its production by around 1.8 mb/d from September to November 2016, and over the same period, OPEC increased its production by about 500,000 b/d. This huge increase of 2.3 mb/d needs to be set against a global demand increase of just 200,000 b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter.

[SLIDE 7]
However, in recent weeks we have seen positive sentiment return, driven by expectations for further improvement in OPEC and non-OPEC conformity, which ended up at 98% in March, and signs that the market rebalancing is taking place.

Total OECD commercial oil stocks in March fell by 23 mb, the second consecutive monthly drop. The total level is 275 mb above the latest five-year average, compared to 314 mb in February, and 356 mb in the same month in 2016.

It should be noted that across the first quarter of 2017, stocks built by 26 mb, which is much less than the seasonal average of 36 mb, even though refinery maintenance globally was much heavier. It is evident that the global inventory overhang of crude and oil products onshore is declining.

Outside of the US, we believe the global trend of destocking is broadly on track. Moreover, we are also seeing numbers from industry stating that crude in floating storage has fallen by over 40 mb since the beginning of the year.

The US has evidently not been reflective of the rest of the world, given rising production there in the first quarter of 2017, but even here the market has now witnessed three consecutive weekly crude stock draws as refinery utilization has risen.

The improving sentiment was seen in a rise in WTI and Brent combined net-long positions, which reached over 751,000 contracts on April 18, from 670,000 on April 4.

Another encouraging sign is the rise in energy investments in 2017, which are expected to increase by 7%, with numbers in the US of around $20 billion seen for the first quarter of 2017. This is a significant improvement over last year, when the recurrent investment buzz words were ‘cut backs’ and ‘freezes’.

These are all signs of a renewed sense of positive momentum and improving stability in the global oil market.

[SLIDE 8]
We need to appreciate that the market rebalancing was never going to occur in a linear fashion. There are too many factors at play.

Nonetheless, we are heading in the right direction. Slowly, steadily, but surely we are seeing light at the end of the tunnel.

Looking ahead, the general expectations for demand growth for crude and oil products in the coming months remain bullish, supported by anticipated firm economic performance across the world, as highlighted in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook, and the expected increase in demand for gasoline over the driving season, mainly in North America and Asia.

Additionally, the return of refineries from seasonal maintenance, together with the high conformity observed in the OPEC and non-OPEC voluntary production adjustments, should enhance market stability and reduce volatility.

For OPEC, the focus remains on conformity, which is being analyzed and monitored through a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee, the JMMC, and a supporting Joint Technical Committee, the JTC. These are vital for the transparency required to implement these decisions in a full and timely manner, on the core principles of equity and fairness.

We remain confident that all 24 participating countries remain steadfast in honouring their commitments to individually achieve the 100 per cent level. This is our firm goal.

[SLIDE 9]
The importance of fast tracking the rebalancing process, and returning market stability, is also vital to the medium- to long-term oil, and the necessary investments required for the world’s growing oil and energy future.

In the tenth edition of our World Oil Outlook, launched last November, oil demand is expected to reach over 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040, an increase of over 16 million barrels a day from 2015 levels. This demand growth is driven by developing countries and an expanding transportation sector, with more than one-third of the total increase expected in the road transportation sector, as well as significant growth in petrochemicals.

Moreover, as both OPEC and the International Energy Agency agree, there are no expectations for an oil demand peak in the foreseeable future. Oil will clearly remain a fuel of choice in the coming decades.

This expansion in demand will obviously require significant investments in new barrels and to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. Overall, we see oil-related investment requirements of around $10 trillion over the period to 2040.

The industry needs timely, adequate and sustainable investment to guarantee security of supply to the global community.

[SLIDE 10]
Finally, I would like to respond to one of the pertinent questions posed by the organisers of this conference, and one that is perhaps apt to end on: What lessons have we learned from the 2014-2016 price collapse?

Although the jury is still out, we do feel it is appropriate to provide some pointers.

With that, I thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/171-27-april-2017.html"

​[SLIDE 3]
​It gives me great pleasure to always return to Abu Dhabi, thriving capital of the United Arab Emirates that has remained in the forefront of new frontiers of technology and innovations. The invitation to speak at the Third Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Petroleum Media Forum is my 3rd visit since assuming office in the summer of last year. First we were invited to ADIPEC, where we launched the 10th edition of our World Oil Outlook (WOO) – the first outside the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, and the first in our Member Country. Secondly we were invited to the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum, where together with the IEA, we shared our Oil Outlooks and the challenges we overcame in navigating the road map to the three historic decisions we reached first year.

​It is significant that it was Abu Dhabi where it all started for the GCC back in May 1981 when its six Member Countries – OPEC Members Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, along with Oman and Bahrain - had the foresight to sign up to what has become one of the most important and influential economic and trading blocks in the world today. Supported by their vast hydrocarbon resources, these nations under the GCC umbrella have been among the fastest-growing economies worldwide in recent years. Of course, like all other oil-producing nations, they have been affected by the oil market downturn, which began in the summer of 2014 and the effects of which are still lingering with us today.

​Despite the current stagnation, which sees the group’s economic growth still holding firm at around 2.3% in 2017, the future is not only bright but assured for the GCC, which will continue to have great influence on present and future world energy supplies. In keeping with this growing international standing, the GCC’s relationship with the region’s media is an extremely important aspect that warrants close scrutiny and serious attention. This Forum is therefore timely and well suited. It is a strong and consolidated initiative that has already made great progress. This is indeed commendable since the significance of the media to us all in the petroleum industry cannot be overstated.

​Your Highness, excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​[SLIDE 4]
​Today, I would like to share with you OPEC’s perspectives on two interlinked fronts. First, I would like to update you on the extraordinary developments that have occurred over the past few months since we signed the now historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ with non-OPEC producing countries to restore oil market stability. Then I would like to offer my thoughts on the role of the international media in the petroleum sector, especially in the context of our work at OPEC.

​Throughout 2016, extensive efforts, backed by a solid determination, were made to assist in correcting the persistent imbalance witnessed in the international oil market since 2014. Our formal and informal meetings and discussions within OPEC, and other major stakeholders, including non-OPEC countries, towards restoring the balance and stability have been to say the least intense and extensive taking us far and wide as we strived for all-inclusiveness in building a consensus and instilling confidence among all the parties involved. These intensive and extensive consultations and meetings from Doha – Vienna – Algiers – Vienna as well as literally most of the capitals of our Member Countries were the most exhaustive in the history of OPEC, and indeed all the previous five oil market cycles. The collective determination of our Ministers was stretched to the limits hence the timely intervention of our sovereigns.

​This epic journey we embarked on in 2016 is still very much a work in progress – yet the early results are extremely encouraging. From 1 January this year, OPEC and a group of 11 leading non-OPEC oil producers have begun the implementation of the production adjustments totaling around 1.8 million barrels per day. Our ultimate goal, of course, is to reinstate lasting stability to the market for the benefit of all stakeholders, producers, consumers and the global economy at large.

​[SLIDE 5]
​The last few years have been a torrid time for all those involved in our industry and we are optimistic that the policy measures we have taken have already placed us on to the path of recovery. We decided on 10th December 2016 that the production adjustments should run for the first six months of 2017. We are monitoring this process very closely through a Joint Technical Committee (JTC) that convenes every month and reports to a five-Member Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), which meets bimonthly to oversee overall progress. The second meeting of the JMMC took place in Kuwait City on 26 March – and the results were beyond expectations. For the month of February, conformity to the adjustments stood at 94 per cent, which was eight percentage points above the January figure - already, in itself, impressive. And the March data is showing an even better performance again, with a higher conformity, underlying our commitment to our common objective.

​I am indeed very confident our collective action will continue to prove effective and bring us the results we are seeking. Of course, all the GCC Members are actively involved in spearheading these efforts and I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank His Highness, the UAE President, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and the other GCC Heads of State and Governments as well as their able Ministers for their exemplary leadership. I would also like to pay a special tribute to His Excellency, the Minister of Energy of the UAE, Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, for his skillful, persuasive and constructive engagements during the intensive negotiations behind closed doors. He displayed a deep knowledge of the technical intricacies of the complex issues involved and always provided a simplified solution in the way forward.

​Significantly, OPEC’s historic ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ with non-OPEC producers is showing to the international community what can be achieved when OPEC finds its compass and returns to its statutory role. We are therefore understandably proud of what we have accomplished so far, which has been against all the odds and to the consternation of many across the spectrum. Together with 11 leading non-OPEC countries, led by the Russian Federation we have turned a new page in the history of oil.

​Your Highness, excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​Throughout its history, OPEC has been committed to two statutory watchwords - stability and cooperation. In our experience, they are two sides of the same coin. The best way to achieve stability is through cooperation, while cooperation itself needs stability of commitment by those participating for any process to be meaningful and worthwhile. And with petroleum set to remain at the centre stage of the energy mix in the foreseeable future, OPEC will continue to sing from this hymn sheet which it knows holds all the right notes. Stability through cooperation is tried and trusted – and OPEC is convinced it is the way forward for an industry that will always have challenges to overcome. We therefore call on other producers, not yet on this global platform, to hasten to join.

​[SLIDE 6]
​Of course, the cooperation I speak of is not just confined to the producers or consumers of oil, but to another strategic stakeholder – the global mass media, as well. Of all the international organizations in existence today, OPEC is perhaps the one that is most frequently in the media spotlight and intense scrutiny. The Organization is written about on a daily basis and most leading media houses even have specialized teams of journalists that focus exclusively on OPEC. At each and every Ministerial Conference of the Organization we receive between 250 and 300 members of the international media descending on the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna. And because we are under this constant glare of exposure, it is both essential and mutually beneficial that we have positive working relations with our colleagues in the media.

​Such ties are invaluable for establishing and consolidating efficient and productive links of communication. With OPEC regularly making the news it is vital that our decisions, which often have far-reaching implications for the global energy business and beyond, are not misunderstood or misconstrued. A good deal of that basically comes down to the relationship we have with the members of the media.

​In this regard, OPEC needs to remain transparent in its day-to-day operations and clear in its policy initiatives so that the media can have ready access to the Organization’s information and decisions. Importantly, our channel of communication with the mass media must always be open and reliable. In return, we expect the various media outfits and individuals to report accurately, fairly and responsibly on the Organization and its Members. This also requires a high level of professionalism on behalf of the media. Journalists covering petroleum need to be fully conversant about the industry’s issues to be able to write with authority. And for the rapport to prosper there has to be openness, trust and understanding on both sides. I want to think that our general relationship with the media today, not only in the GCC region, but across the world in general, may not be perfect, but is constantly growing in awareness, trust and respect.

​However, fostering good ties in any undertaking does not happen overnight. That is an ongoing process that needs constant nurturing through education, insight and understanding. That is why regular seminars, specialist training workshops and fora, such as this one, are so important for enabling economic blocs like the GCC, or organizations like OPEC, to sit down with media representatives to learn more about each other’s perspectives, expectations and aspirations. After all, information is the raw material of the oil industry. This informs our current international outreach and sustained advocacy that is gradually but steadily changing the face of OPEC, globally.

​Your Highness, excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​The ladies and gentlemen of the press constantly remind us that we have an important social responsibility to mankind to fulfill that cannot and should not be ignored. While technology has played a key role in advancing the fortunes of the oil industry, the media, on its part, has been instrumental in bringing the industry closer to the society we serve. Every oil company today has a department or unit dedicated to raising its profile as a responsible corporate citizen - explaining to the public what it does and how it does it. This is about enhancing the relationship between oil and society – bringing awareness to the people of the unique advantages offered by the world’s oil and gas resources, yet showing what the industry is doing to make its operations safer, more efficient and in tune, particularly, with a cleaner environment.

​[SLIDE 7]
​However, under the watchful eye of the media, we can be proud to say that the industry continues to work very hard to improve its ‘green’ credentials by adapting new technologies to its drilling, production, refining, marketing and distribution activities. OPEC Member Countries have undertaken significant climate change-related projects in their petroleum operations. The UAE, for one, is at the forefront of the industry’s response measures. It is firmly committed to energy diversification, with renewables taking centre stage. Masdar City, located here in Abu Dhabi, is designed to be the most environmentally sustainable city in the world, while the Masdar Energy Company has grown to be a world authority on the subject of renewables. OPEC Member Countries are also pursuing the development of other ground-breaking processes, such as carbon capture and sequestration projects combined with enhanced oil recovery schemes, all in the quest to make their products and operations more environmentally friendly.

​Your Highness, excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​[SLIDE 8]
​This brings me to one of the most important issues of our time, which I feel I must mention – that of climate change and our response as global producers of petroleum. Let me first state that OPEC, as an Organization – and I personally - have been at the forefront of the environmental debate and intergovernmental negotiations nearly from its inception. As the global energy transition has progressed, OPEC remains fully mindful of the fact that Member Countries need to use their energy resources in the most efficient, safe and effective way possible, so as to help sustain a healthy planet today and for future generations. But our Organization is also wary of the possible response measures by governments that have the potential to impact energy demand, the welfare of our Member Countries and their socio-economic development - in fact the overall future economy of petroleum. OPEC welcomed the landmark Paris Agreement reached at COP 21 in 2015. Our Member Countries played an important role in reaching the Agreement and will also play a leading role in its implementation – all 13 OPEC Members have already signed the Agreement and are in the process of ratifying it. I believe I am right in saying that the UAE was in fact the first country to put its signature to the ratification. Going forward, we sincerely hope that the same cooperative spirit that led to the successful adoption of the Paris Agreement will be maintained during its implementation stage, despite current uncertainties.

​However, as oil producers and a vital cog in the wheels of the global economy, there are certain conditions we need to see met. First, it is essential that the Agreement continues to be guided by the principles and provisions set by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The core principles of equity, underpinned by common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities should not be compromised. Secondly, in choosing the right path, it is critical to remember that oil and gas will continue to be the mainstay of the world economy for the foreseeable future. That undeniable fact has to be accommodated in any final formal plans agreed. Thirdly, as the environmental response develops, it is imperative that the unique situation and circumstances of developing countries be given the priority it deserves. It is critical for us to ensure that the world’s less-developed countries and their populations have equitable access to development and growth opportunities. And that means access to efficient and safe energy resources. OPEC attaches great importance to sustainable development, which is the foundation of growth and prosperity.

​Combatting energy poverty is combatting poverty itself. I am pleased to say that OPEC’s sister organization, the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID), is making great strides in tackling sustainable development and energy poverty issues. Its energy related funding programme currently extends to 90% of the world’s poorest countries, helping them through public and private sector lending, trade financing and grants. In 2016 alone, the energy sector attracted one-third of OFID’s total cumulative commitments for the year. This was equivalent to US$4.3 billion. As of February 2017, OFID’s cumulative commitments for all sectors stood at US$20.3 billion, with total disbursements amounting to US$13.7 billion.

​Your Highness, excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​[SLIDE 9]
​OPEC, itself, is constantly looking at areas where it can broaden its information dissemination, especially in the promotion of data transparency with such organizations as JODI, which it is closely affiliated to. Under this transparency drive, OPEC is also expanding its outreach, particularly in Member Countries. In cooperation with the UAE Energy Ministry, we unveiled a new Smart App version for the Organization’s Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB). And in this Forum, we will unveil a new multi-year ‘Big Data’ project, which is again in partnership with the UAE Energy Ministry and is aimed at developing a sophisticated, comprehensive and easy-to-use multi-dimensional big data tool for analyzing publicly available oil and gas data. In this regard, I would again like to say a special thank-you to His Excellency, the UAE Minister, his officials at the Ministry, as well as the Government, for taking the lead in initiating and advancing such strategic joint ventures between the UAE and OPEC. We hope this will encourage other OPEC Member Countries to establish similar partnerships.

​Your Highness, excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​These are all important initiatives for an Organization that is always looking to enhance its reputation and international standing as an open and accommodating entity. These achievements need to be brought into the public discourse in a positive fashion. That is down to the role of the media, which shoulders a great deal of responsibility for such accurate and timely dissemination. But in this way, the petroleum industry and the media are seen proactively working hand-in-hand to drive home public understanding of the responsible and innovative ways OPEC and the industry operate.

​Of course, nowadays, we have another information outlet that we simply cannot ignore – the face of social media, which seemingly continues to expand with each passing year. These are already firmly established applications that are having a growing influence on all walks of society. They are ultra-fast and have the ability to make any piece of news go viral within minutes. But as good as that sounds, there are also pitfalls. The new social media thrust has few boundaries and requires no professionalism or experience. Anyone with a smart phone can become a journalist. And most users of social media are not bound by any media codes or ethics. But while it is true that one cannot control the message on social media, the oil industry still needs to embrace its existence and realize and exploit its true potential for getting our sometimes complex messages across in a timely fashion.

​Your Highness, excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

"2017-04-02","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure for me to be here in Iraq, a Founding Member of our Organization and the birthplace of OPEC, on the occasion of such an important meeting as the 3rd Iraq Energy Forum.

I would like to thank, and pay my respects to the Prime Minister of Iraq, HE Dr. Haider Al-Abadi. It was an honour to hear him deliver his keynote address earlier. This was preceded by a very constructive meeting we had with the Prime Minister yesterday.

I would also like to thank HE Jabbar Ali Hussein Al-Luiebi, Iraq’s Minister of Oil, and the Iraq Energy Institute, for the invitation to participate at this prestigious event. HE Jabbar Ali Hussein Al-Luiebi has restored Iraq’s leadership role in OPEC since he assumed his office last summer.

In the same regard, I would like to extend my deep appreciation for the constructive, flexible and accommodating role the Iraqi leadership played in the challenging negotiations that helped bring about last year’s historic OPEC and non-OPEC decisions. The ones in Algiers at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference on September 28, in Vienna at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference on November 30, and again in Vienna, with the ‘Declaration of Cooperation’ with non-OPEC producers on December 10. These three landmark and historic decisions would not have been possible without the role played by Iraq.

I personally recall the positive talks I had when I visited Iraq back in October 2016, when I met with the President of Iraq, HE Dr. Fuad Masum, as well as HE Dr. Haider Al-Abadi, who were both proactive, practical and showed great leadership.

[SLIDE 2 – Disclaimer]
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

[SLIDE 3]
As I am here speaking in Baghdad, I cannot pass up the opportunity to recognize Iraq’s central role, almost 57 years ago, in the setting up of the then fledging group, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in September 1960.

Here in this city on the banks of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris in the land of Mesopotamia near the historic Babylon, the five Founding Fathers of OPEC, Venezuela’s Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo of Venezuela, Abdullah al-Tariki of Saudi Arabia, Dr Tala’at al-Shaibani of Iraq, Dr Fuad Rouhani of Iran and Ahmed Sayed Omar of Kuwait gathered together in the Al-Shaab Hall, to midwife this Organization on 10–14 September 1960. This became known as the historic ‘Baghdad Conference’.

These five Founding Members representing their oil-producing nations joined together around the premise of cooperation, with a commitment to safeguard their legitimate national interests and to ensure order and stability in the international oil market. There was no fanfare, just five developing nations setting about the business of defending their legitimate national interests.

When OPEC was set up in 1960, there were some who predicted that the Organization would not last long. It seemed the odds were stacked against them, in a world where the global oil industry was previously dominated by the established industrialized powers.

Yet, little by little, OPEC began to make its mark. In this light, the formation of OPEC was a pioneering act, an act that demonstrated that even developing countries had rights. Their indigenous resources were more than just a convenience for others; a concept that every nation around the world can appreciate.

That initial small group of developing countries has now evolved into a group of 13 that is respected far and wide as an established part of the international energy community. It has overcome many challenges, and it continues to prosper.

It has helped maintain stable and regular supplies of oil to the global market; it has expanded its role on the global stage; and it has helped enhance and build better cooperation and dialogue among producers and consumers, as well as other international organizations. These are all enshrined in the OPEC Statute that was crafted when OPEC was formed, and they remain relevant today.

As a Founding Member, Iraq has played a pivotal role in OPEC’s evolution to what the Organization represents today. And it continues to show the leadership and commitment to the Organization that ensures OPEC remains engaged and relevant today.

[SLIDE 4]
In this regard, I would like to underline the three landmark decisions I made reference to at the beginning of my speech, the ones from Algiers and Vienna.

When I assumed office as OPEC Secretary General back on August 1, 2016, it quickly became evident to me that all producers, as well as consumers, had begun to fully comprehend the gravity of the oil cycle that began in mid-2014.

There was an acknowledgement that stability on a sustainable basis had eluded the industry for far too long, to the detriment of producers, like OPEC Member Countries that rely on petroleum revenues to fuel their economic development, consumers, the hydrocarbons industry, and the global economy.

There had been a sharp global inventory build between mid-2014 and the start of 2016 as supply outpaced demand. OECD commercial oil stock levels reached historic highs in early 2016.

In both 2015 and 2016, the industry also witnessed a dramatic contraction in investments. Global oil and gas exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015 and a further 22 per cent in 2016. Combined, this equates to above $300 billion. This was impacting not only new projects coming on-stream, but new discoveries as well.

And the industry also saw significant job losses, as well as increasing financial and operational stresses for many companies.

[SLIDE 5]
Oil market instability and imbalance was reflected in the sharp crude price decline observed between June 2014 and January 2016, when the oil price fell by an unprecedented 80 per cent. It is the largest percentage fall in the six cycles of sharp price declines we have observed over the past four decades. The depth and duration of the downturn was alarming, and so were the impacts.

To put it simply: the oil industry could not continue along this path. Something had to be done to tackle the major stresses that were suffocating the industry, and impacting current and future oil supplies.

[SLIDE 6]
It led to OPEC embarking on the most extensive consultations among OPEC Member Countries and between OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations to build consensus about the strategic urgency of restoring sustainable oil market stability in a collective manner.

This included a visit here to Iraq with an OPEC delegation where, as I mentioned earlier, I met with the Iraqi leadership.

They were all tremendously supportive of OPEC’s efforts to stabilize the oil market. I was extremely grateful for this encouragement, particularly as the country was waging, and continues to wage war against terrorism and the ISIS in Mosul, as well as other places in Iraq. Let me say that that the war you are waging against terrorism is not only for the defense of Iraq, but the region and the world as a whole.

The exhaustive and determined consultative efforts, the consistent and encouraging advocacy, and the diligence and courage of everyone involved, has been widely acclaimed, by both producers and consumers.

These historic and landmark decisions are a sign of the Organization’s commitment to all oil industry stakeholders, both producers and consumers, as well as one to the broader global community, through the restoration of oil market stability and the potential positives of this for the global economy.

[SLIDE 7]
The focus now is on the implementation of these production adjustment decisions, which are being analyzed and monitored through a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and a supporting Joint Technical sub-Committee. These are vital for the openness and transparency required to implement these decisions in a full and timely manner.

To date, conformity with the decisions by all participating countries has been very encouraging. For January 2017, OPEC and non-OPEC nations achieved a conformity level of 86 per cent. And in February, the overall conformity improved further to 94 per cent.

However, there is still room for further improvement. Each participating nation needs to look at their individual voluntary contribution, and remember that the decisions taken last year were on the basis of fairness, equity and transparency.

In this, I am confident that all countries remain steadfast in honouring their commitments to individually achieve the 100 per cent level. This is our firm goal. We cannot seek anything less.

This commitment is vital to ensure we keep on the right path to a stable, balanced market, which contribute to improved outlooks for both the short- and long-term

[SLIDE 8]
Following these historic decisions taken last year we believe we are already seeing more favourable industry conditions. In this regard, I think it is also important to recognize just how far we have come since we fully embarked on the process of rebalancing the market and returning stability on a sustainable basis.

For example, at the end of July 2016, WTI and Brent combined net-long positions were at a level of 350,000 contracts, which then increased to 500,000 contracts on November 29, just before OPEC took its landmark decision, and then to 921,000 contracts on February 21 this year. Despite a sell-off in the second week of March, the number of net-long positions remains healthy, at around 662,000 contracts.

The market is also showing further signs of realigning, with the OECD stock overhang currently at 282 million barrels above the five-year average. This compares to a level of 380 million barrels at the end of July 2016.

We are also seeing an uptick in energy investments in 2017, when talk was only of retrenchment and investment cuts in the first half of 2016.

And equity markets today are buoyant.

Confidence is returning to the sector. We need to ensure that this positive sentiment is maintained.

[SLIDE 9]
It is also important to highlight that these recent decisions should not only be viewed as a short-term necessity. We need to view these actions as vital to long-term oil market stability and the necessary investments required for the world’s energy future.

The value of this is readily apparent in OPEC’s tenth edition of its World Oil Outlook launched last November, which sees oil demand reaching over 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040, an increase of over 16 million barrels a day from 2015 levels. This demand growth is driven by developing countries and an expanding transportation sector, with more than one-third of the total increase expected in the road transportation sector, as well as significant growth in petrochemicals.

Moreover, as both OPEC and the International Energy Agency agree, there are no expectations for an oil demand peak in the foreseeable future. Oil will clearly remain a fuel of choice in the coming decades.

This expansion in demand will obviously require significant investments. Moreover, new barrels are needed to not only increase production, but also to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. Overall, we see oil-related investment requirements of around $10 trillion over the period to 2040.

The industry needs timely, adequate and sustainable investment to guarantee security of supply to the global community.

[SLIDE 10]
To meet its obligations as a secure and reliable supplier of oil to world markets, I have no doubt that OPEC Member Countries remain committed to investing in new capacity and necessary infrastructure, despite the downturn we have witnessed in the last couple of years.

This is certainly true here in Iraq.

Over the past few years the country has made significant progress in raising its production capacity, despite the many above-ground challenges it has faced. It is again the second largest OPEC producer and the fourth largest globally.

It also has enormous potential for future development. In OPEC’s Annual Statistical Bulletin 2016, Iraq had the fourth largest global proven crude oil reserves in 2015 at over 142 billion barrels, which has since grown to 153 billion barrels, and the country’s reservoirs are widely regarded as some of the best in the world.

Moreover, Iraq is also ideally positioned for the large oil demand growth expected from the Asia-region in the coming decades.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

For the oil market, the focus today is on the rebalancing process and returning sustainable stability to the market. In this regard, the full and timely implementation of the historic decisions taken last year by OPEC and non-OPEC nations is vital.

For Iraq, as well as the region and the world, the focus is also on defeating terrorism and the ISIS, so as achieve the security the country and the region needs. In this regard, I know there has been significant headway made since I last visited Iraq in October 2016, and I am sure this progress will continue.

There is no doubt that Iraq post-ISIS, and with a stable oil market in place, will have the opportunities to fulfill its great economic and energy potential.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/173-2-april-2017.html"
"2017-03-26","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​I would like to thank the Kuwaiti Government and HE Issam A. Almarzooq, for hosting the 2nd Meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC). It is a great pleasure to return to Kuwait, the Jewel in the Gulf.

​I would also like to thank everyone, both OPEC and non-OPEC delegations alike, for being here and for your continuous engagement towards fulfilling the objectives of this Committee, through the full and timely implementation of the decisions taken last year. Additionally, I would like to also extend my thanks to His Excellency Jabbar Al-Luiebi, Iraq’s Minister of Oil, in his firm stand and valuable contributions throughout the consultation process culminating in these landmark achievements and decisions of the Organization last year.

​I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of the Joint Technical Committee, which met for the second time a little over a week ago at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna. Your efforts are greatly appreciated.

​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​At this juncture, and given recent market developments, I feel it is important that we take stock as to the current state of the oil market. We need to understand what has happened since the historic decisions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC last year, where we are today, and what is potentially ahead of us.

​On the back of the decisions taken at the 171st Ministerial Conference on November 30, 2016, and the Declaration of Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers on December 10, 2016, as well as the high level of conformity to the voluntary production adjustments seen in January, market optimism significantly improved.

​This can be observed by the fact that WTI and Brent combined net-long positions increased from close to 500,000 contracts on November 29, 2016, to 763,000 on January 3, 2017. This is an increase of 34%. They then moved higher to reach 921,000 contracts on February 21, an additional rise of 21%.

​I have to underline that fundamentals in the oil market today would have been much different without these decisions that have now effectively been put into action.

​However, despite the expectation of improved levels of conformity in February, which have proven to be true, the market’s sentiment has turned, with the combined number of WTI and Brent net-long positions falling to 695,000 by March 14. This is a drop of 25% since February 21.

​It is important to note that this softening of the market is not totally unexpected.

​Firstly, we are in a seasonally low demand period.

​Secondly, another seasonal trend is the shut-in of refinery throughput in the US. In January and February, 1 mb/d of throughput was shut down for maintenance. For these two months, this equates to approximately 60 million barrels.

​Thirdly, in addition to these seasonal trends, in recent months we have also seen rising production from a number of non-OPEC nations, particularly in the US from tight oil. Moreover, we are seeing expectations for much greater quantities to come from non-OPEC in 2017, as reported by all major reporting agencies since the start of this year.

​For example, in the January 2017 OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report, non-OPEC supply was projected to grow by 120,000 b/d in 2017. In the March report, this number had risen to 400,000 b/d, driven mainly by estimations for rising growth in the US, as well as in Canada and Brazil.

​And fourthly, we also need to recognize that the fourth quarter of 2016 was a period of significantly rising supplies. Non-OPEC increased its production by around 1.8 mb/d from September to November 2016, and over the same period, OPEC increased its production by about 500,000 b/d. This combined 2.3 mb/d expansion needs to be set against a global demand increase of just 200,000 b/d in the fourth quarter of 2016.

​This supply growth is now working its way through the system. It will take time for the market to fully absorb.

​These developments have translated into stock levels remaining persistently high. The OECD stock overhang is currently at 282 million barrels above the five-year average, and in the US, crude stocks have reached a historical high of 533 million barrels that is mainly attributed, as mentioned, to lower refinery throughput coupled with increasing US production in a seasonally low demand period. However, outside the US, the global trend of destocking has been broadly on track.

​In recent months, I have spoken to many financial market players active in the oil market, at events in both London and Houston. It was evident that there was a significant level of bullishness in the first two months of this year, with a general recognition that the rebalancing was occurring, but this was tempered somewhat by questions about the months ahead.

​This included questions such as:

​When can we expect to see a strong and declining trend in stock levels, particularly in the US?

​What can OPEC and non-OPEC nations participating in last year’s decisions achieve in the first half of 2017?

​And what might happen in the second half of 2017?

​These are questions to focus the minds of this Committee.

​Moreover, we need to remember the role that these financial actors play in the oil market today. They play a major function, possibly a significant and determining factor, in the value of the oil sold daily.

​To highlight this we need to compare the size of the physical and the financial markets for oil. The size of the physical market today is 95 mb/d. Whereas if we take open interests, including all traders, the volume of the financial market for oil represents more than 60 times that of the actual physical market!

​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​Conformity levels in January and February have been better than market expectations, but further advancements can, and need to be made. It is vital that we see the full commitment of each and every participating country. We expect 100% conformity.

​This will be vital to help counter the market developments I have just highlighted, and the increasing volatility we have witnessed over the past couple of weeks. We still believe that the full and timely implementation of the decisions taken last year will see destocking accelerate by the end of the first half of 2017 with positive upshots and anticipated balanced market towards the end of the year.

​It is critical we keep our eyes on the goal. We need to ensure an acceleration of the drawdown of the stock overhang, and bring the necessary market rebalancing forward.

​I cannot think anything to the contrary. We need to be patient, and demonstrate our strong will to allow our decision to run its course.

​I join the chair and the co-chair in urging all participants to meet their obligations under the very guiding principles of fairness, equity, transparency, and timeliness.

​Thank you for your kind attention. I will now give the floor back to my good friend, the Committee Chairman, HE Issam Almarzooq.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/174-26-march-2017.html"
"2017-03-26","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Good morning. I would like to welcome you to the second meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) and start by thanking you all for accepting our invitation to attend this meeting in Kuwait.

​It is a pleasure and an honour for Kuwait to be both host and Chair of this event. It is part of our contribution to this historic process – and I hope that during your stay in Kuwait you will have the chance to enjoy some of our hospitality.

​I would like to commend His Excellency Alexander Novak, Russia’s Minister of Energy, for serving as Alternate Chairman of this Committee – and for his tireless work and support to this process. Additionally, I would like to also extend my thanks to His Excellency Jabbar Al-Luiebi, Iraq’s Minister of Oil, in honouring our invitation at very short notice.

​I would like to recall that the JMMC was established directly in response to OPEC’s 171st Ministerial Conference decision of 30 November 2016, and the subsequent historic Declaration of Cooperation made at the joint OPEC-non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting of 10 December 2016.

​These landmark efforts were made because the oil industry could no longer continue along the same path it was on in 2015 and 2016. Something had to be done to address the major challenges that were suffocating the industry, and impacting current and future oil supplies. Producers everywhere recognized the need to stimulate the acceleration of the drawdown of the stock overhang, in order to bring the necessary market rebalancing forward, and ensure that much-needed investments returned to the industry.

​In support of this historic cooperation, this Committee, which concluded its inaugural meeting on 22 January at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, put together a framework of monitoring mechanisms. We are so far pleased with the level of conformity to this framework.

​Part of that framework included the creation of a Joint Technical Committee – JTC – which met for the second time last Friday in Vienna. The mandate of the JTC was to produce a monthly report for the JMMC and I would like to thank the JTC for its support so far, and for the very useful report which has been provided to us. This will help move this process forward.

​As you know, the JMMC is tasked with ensuring that the objectives of the Ministerial Conference decision and the Declaration of Cooperation are achieved through successful implementation of voluntary adjustments in production. In addition, the last time we met we reaffirmed our commitment to joint cooperation for the achievement of a lasting stability in the oil market – in the interest of oil producers, consumers and the industry. The Committee thereafter reiterated its resolve to full and timely conformity to the agreements.

​Our task here today is to discuss oversight and conformity issues, and to then report to the OPEC-non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting on the 25th of May, the status of implementation. So far, we have seen some progress, with very positive signs that the conformity from both OPEC and non-OPEC countries has successfully been demonstrated to the outside world.

​In addition, production numbers for January and February were well received and the market has responded affirmatively to the determined efforts of all participating countries.

​I want to emphasize here that some producers have over-performed. They certainly deserve recognition for their efforts. So I would like to expressly offer my appreciation to both Angola and Saudi Arabia for conforming beyond expectation. I hope their achievements will motivate other participants to reach their own goals – and perhaps to even go further.

​Meanwhile, some other countries have not been able to meet their production adjustments due to temporary difficulties.

​I would like to candidly say that, in general, more has to be done. We need to see conformity across the board. We assured ourselves – and the world – that we would reach our adjustment to 100 per cent conformity.

​Our voluntary adjustment is and will remain 100 per cent, and although this should be seen as a collective effort, individual countries also need to take their conformity very seriously. If we reach our common objective, we could see balance returning to the market by the third quarter of 2017. If not, this date may be pushed further out.

​As we have observed over the past couple of weeks, stocks remain stubbornly high, particularly in the US, where a seasonally rising trend has hit new historically high levels. We have also seen some traders liquidate their long positions and Brent prices have dropped from the mid-50s to the low-50s. Volatility has also increased.

​At the same time, while investments may be returning in some of the industry’s short-cycle projects, there is little investment going into the long-cycle projects that are the baseload of the industry.

​All this should focus our minds. We need to further intensify our efforts.

​The uncertainty we have witnessed may continue until the trend of inventory drawdowns asserts itself and the market becomes more comfortable with its capacity to absorb additional marginal supplies.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​At today’s meeting, we hope to facilitate an exchange of joint analyses and outlooks. These are important, as they will provide valuable input to the evaluation of the conformity process.

​I should also remind everyone that there will be one more meeting of the JMMC before the Meeting of the OPEC Conference in May. Until then, the work undertaken by this Committee remains the main driver behind future actions of the Ministerial Meeting. We thus hope that your conformity will remain unwavering – and that we can look forward to positive results between now and then.

​I would like to remind you all that we are under close scrutiny by the international community and the financial markets. The work of this Committee is thus essential to help rebuild confidence in the global oil markets and to achieve the sustainable stability that we are striving for. I thus would like to encourage you to do your very best today, and in the coming weeks and months, in the lead-up to our next meeting. There is a lot at stake.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Each of us is looking forward to the day when investments once again reach healthy levels, and the world economy is strong and robust. This will be well-served if we do our work – and the long-term deepening of ties and ongoing cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries will go a long way to supporting such goals.

​I would like to thank you all for your attention. I will now give the floor over to His Excellency Alexander Novak, Co-Chairman of the JMMC.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/175-26-march-2017.html"
"2017-03-16","​Distinguished experts – and IEA, IEF and OPEC colleagues:

​Good morning. Allow me to begin by welcoming you to Vienna and to the OPEC Secretariat for the Second Joint IEA-IEF-OPEC Technical Meeting on the interactions between physical and financial energy markets.

​I believe it is a testament to the growing importance of this complex and evolving subject that we continue to meet and gather such a distinguished and diverse group of high level experts. We have speakers and participants here from across the physical and financial divide. To all of you: welcome.

​We would like to thank our co-organizers for their great efforts in making this event possible. We particularly appreciate the attendance of our distinguished guest and friend, His Excellency, the Secretary General of the International Energy Forum, Dr. Sun Xiansheng. With his energy, commitment and foresight, Dr. Sun has already had a postitive impact in strengthening and extending the consumer-producer dialogue. I had the opportunity to enjoy the warm hospitality of the IEF at the time of the IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks, and am more than pleased to try to return the favour with his visit to the OPEC Secretariat for this joint event. It is a pleasant industry consensus that the arrival of Dr. Sun at the IEF has dramatically changed the forum.

​From the IEA, we have our colleague Neil Atkinson, the Head of the Oil Industry and Markets Division, who I understand began his career at one of our National Oil Companies – PDVSA – so it is nice to welcome you back. Mr. Atkinson has arrived fresh from releasing the IEA Monthly Oil Market Report yesterday, so he should have all of the latest information at his fingertips.

​Today’s event represents one of three regular dialogues held under the IEA-IEF-OPEC joint work programme, which was established and endorsed by Energy Ministers at the 12th International Energy Forum in Cancún, Mexico, in 2010. This includes the Symposium on Energy Outlooks and the Symposium on Gas and Coal Market Outlooks. These events have attracted participation at the highest levels, and also been commended at the highest level – most recently by the G20 Energy Ministers in their Beijing Communique in June of last year and by the Energy Ministers at the 15th International Energy Forum in Algeria in September 2016. These remarkable efforts are also complemented by the good work that the IEA, IEF and OPEC contribute to the JODI initiative, which has been essential to enhancing energy data transparency.

​These collective efforts underscore the tangible benefits that the strengthening consumer-producer dialogue has brought to the market, and we look forward to deepening and enriching this engagement with close collaboration of our good friend Dr. Sun and his organization, and Dr. Birol and colleagues at the IEA.

​This also highlights the importance of our work here today, and in this regard the contribution of everyone here in the discussions and deliberations is essential. Each of you bring a different perspective of the market – from the financial side, the physical side, governments, regulatory bodies, market analysts and experts. This is a testament to the strengths of this dialogue – and it allows us to exchange views and collectively present a more complete and rounded picture of the market and the interactions between its physical and financial sides.

​We have a long day ahead of us, but allow me to offer you a few preliminary thoughts that I hope can serve as a brief overview of what we will be considering today.

​As an Organization of physical oil producers, OPEC is keenly aware of this evolution that has taken place in the oil market, with the emergence of oil as an asset class, a development that took off in earnest in 2005. It is this unique perspective that has allowed the Organization to take a leadership role in highlighting the need for a better understanding of the interactions between physical and financial oil markets.

​As Acting OPEC Secretary General in 2006, I had the opportunity to pioneer and co-chair a workshop organized under the OPEC dialogue with the European Union on the impact of financial markets on the price of oil. This laid the groundwork for subsequent consumer-producer Summits held in Jeddah and London in 2008, during the global financial crisis, as well as the now well-established Joint IEF-IEA-OPEC Workshops Interactions between Physical and Financial Energy Markets that have been held since 2010.

​It has been through this international energy dialogue and collaboration that OPEC and our sister organizations in the IEF and IEA have helped to contribute to the more widespread recognition that crude oil price formation is the result of a complex interaction of physical and financial factors, including the activities of money managers.

​At the same time, OPEC recognizes that financialization of the oil market – the result of emergence of oil as an asset class – remains an important driver of market developments, in conjunction with fundamentals as well as other non-fundamental factors. The impact of financialization on both price behaviour and market functioning is acknowledged to be evolving rather than static, and as a result requires continuous monitoring and analysis, as well as engagement with market participants across the physical and financial oil market divide. This is the reason that since my assumption of office last summer I have made an effort to engage in a dialogue with the broader financial energy community. This is in recognition that we share the same market and therefore benefit from a mutual exchange of views and perspectives.

​Allow me to provide a brief overview of today’s four sessions.

​Our first session on Recent Oil Market Volatility provides an overview of what has happened since last year’s meeting and sets a framework for today’s discussions.

​The second session considers the Evolving Role of Financial Firms in the Oil Market. This includes banks, hedge funds and private equity firms, as well as venture capital. Following the financialization of the oil market, it is essential to follow evolving developments in this space, as it will have an eventual impact on the physical side as well.

​After lunch, our third session is titled Financial oil market regulation: Assessing the impact of Brexit and new US administration. With the apparent winding down of the current regulatory cycle, this will be a very important discussion to provide a view on what shifts might take place in these two important jurisdictions.

​In the final session, we will look at Developments in Market Structure, including Impact on Commercial and Floating Storage. While this is a very technical area, a great deal of money is being made by trading houses and companies that have mastered this trade – so in this regard, some might say we have left the best for last.

​Just as a reminder, today’s discussions will be held under the Chatham House rule. In terms of structure, each session will begin with a few words from the moderator and then concise presentations from our discussion leaders. Then, the floor will be open to allow for a very interactive roundtable discussion amongst all participants. And we look forward to the very active input from each and everyone around the table, as you are all masters of your craft.

​I would now like to invite my distinguished friends and fellow organizers from the IEF and IEA to say a few words, starting with His Excellency, the Secretary General of the International Energy Forum, Dr. Sun Xiansheng.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/176-16-march-2017.html"
"2017-02-28","Your Excellencies, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, fellow countrymen,

I am greatly pleased to have the privilege of delivering this keynote address in my home country. It is always a pleasure to come home. This time I return not only as a fellow countryman, but also as the Secretary General of OPEC and I am honored to share my thoughts with you at the 16th Nigeria Oil and Gas Conference (NOG) today.

This very Conference was created through the vision and leadership of the late Rilwanu Lukman, then OPEC Secretary General and later Presidential Adviser and Minister of Petroleum Resources and the close collaboration that grew between Rilwanu and Alirio Parra, a former Minister of Energy of Venezuela.

The first NOG event took place in London and some three years later NOG was brought to Abuja and it has since evolved to become a major independent platform for discussion and debate among all Nigerian oil industry stakeholders, including a critically important theme of national content. In my view, NOG can be considered as one of the great energy events that has brought much acclaimed prestige to Nigeria.

I should like here to pay a glowing tribute to an icon of the oil and solid minerals industry, Dr Rilwanu Lukman. This is not only as one of the longest-serving heads of both the Nigerian oil industry and OPEC, spanning over four decades with the best interests of his country and OPEC at heart, but also as one of the oil industry’s most influential and respected ambassadors and personalities.

On behalf of OPEC, I should also reiterate our deep appreciation to the honorable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu for his outstanding leadership through the recent challenging downturn in the oil market, as well as his exemplary role in assisting OPEC accomplish the historic decisions in late 2016. Your efforts, Excellency, alongside the efforts of fellow OPEC Ministers, as well as non-OPEC Ministers, should be highly commended.

I should also like to like to seize this opportunity to convey to the Nigerian Government and President Muhammadu Buhari our sincere thanks and admiration for his open and cooperative stance, his willingness to use his good offices and international respect to intervene at his level, and for his flexibility in reaching a consensus solution. All this was instrumental in helping carve out the landmark achievements with concrete deliverables and implementation structures.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Nigeria is a very important country on the African continent and in the world of energy in terms of size, economy and resources, especially regarding petroleum. With an economy of more than half a trillion dollars, Nigeria is by far the largest economy on the continent. It also has the second-largest proven oil reserves in Africa and accounts for more than 3% of the world’s proven crude oil reserves.

Although 2016 was a tough year for all producers, the 2017 forecast for the country is positive, with a growing output target and some exciting new discoveries, such as the Owowo field. Analysis suggests that incremental growth will be recorded for the next three years.

In addition, notable reforms to the NNPC will help the company become more transparent and profitable and encourage investment, thus helping Nigeria meet its hydrocarbon potential.

As the honorable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu stated in a recent address, there has already been a bullish re-entry by oil majors and others to find reserves in the country in 2017, the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill has made good progress and improvements in Niger Delta issues have led to a recent jump in oil production. In general, the future looks bright.

Ladies and gentlemen,

In terms of the short-term global oil market, oil prices have stabilized recently in a relatively narrow range above $50/b for the OPEC Reference Basket, with the market supported by OPEC and several non-OPEC country production voluntary adjustments. Indeed, in January the OPEC Reference Basket was above $52/b. The extreme volatility that was rocking the market has abated.

Looking back, the sharp decline in oil markets that started in June 2014 saw the OPEC Reference Basket price plummet by an unprecedented 80% by January 2016. This constitutes the largest percentage fall of the five downward cycles we have seen over the last three decades. During these past years, global inventories also rose to the highest levels ever witnessed and investment was scaled back for two consecutive years — this is also unprecedented.

[Slide 3]
The knock-on effect caused by price volatility has been felt deeply within our economies and throughout various sectors. Most, if not all of our Member Countries rely largely on oil revenues for their national budgets and we have seen these, in some cases, shrink by as much as 70%. Oil companies have had drastic reductions in earnings, with significant job losses across the industry. Global oil and gas exploration and production spending fell by around 26% in 2015 and a further 22% in 2016. Economic growth slowed in many emerging countries, with some major economies facing recessionary pressure.

[Slide 4]
Many months of intensive consultations were held around the world between OPEC Member Countries and between OPEC and non-OPEC to try and find solutions to this crisis. These extensive consultations resulted in the signing of three landmark agreements:

The landmark decision of OPEC’s Vienna Agreement, the first since Oran in 2008 during the global financial crisis, underlined the importance and urgent need for an institutionalized framework for structured, sustained and transparent partnership with non-OPEC countries. This, in turn, has been openly shared with the public in order to reflect its credible, equitable, transparent, measurable and verifiable features.

The Declaration of Cooperation underlined the resolve of the 24 producing countries to achieve an accelerated realignment of global oil supply and demand. The Declaration also demonstrated the shared commitment of both OPEC and non-OPEC participating countries to work together to reinforce the decision through the establishment of a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) comprising Kuwait, Algeria, Venezuela, the Russian Federation and the Sultanate of Oman.

The Declaration of Cooperation came into force on the first day of January 2017, and it commits a global platform of oil producers – 24 altogether – to a production adjustment of around 1.8 mb/d, during the first six months of 2017. This was the first of its kind – a new historic page!

These landmark decisions have already positively impacted the market as seen by the onset of a more bullish sentiment among oil investors and the global oil industry, as well as a welcome spillover effect to the global economy with improved performance in some key industrialized countries. Recent data confirms that the OPEC-11 achieved a conformity level of 94 percent in January 2017, while together with participating non-OPEC producing countries the conformity level stood at 86%. Let me stress that all 24 countries are confident of further improvements to reach the full and timely conformity of the decisions taken. Our common goal is 100% conformity.

The positive indicators that have been recently seen are leading to better short- and medium-term perspectives for the market, in particular for investment. Africa has a great deal of investment potential and economies are receiving a lot of support from recent hard-earned market stability, thus investors are once again eyeing the continent.

Market stability is paramount to economic growth and development, particularly for oil-producing countries that are often closely linked to resource endowments. OPEC and its Member Countries have been tireless in striving to maintain stable markets for the benefit of both producers and consumers.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Looking down the road, it is clear that the world’s need for energy will continue to grow as the population expands and more people come out of poverty. According to OPEC’s 2016 World Oil Outlook, released in November 2016, the global population is expected to increase by almost 1.8 billion people from 2015–2040 to surpass 9 billion people, with most of the growth occurring in developing countries, in particular led by Middle East and Africa.

[Slide 5]
GDP growth is also expected to gradually improve and average 3.4% per annum from 2015-2021, with the overall growth rate between 2015 and 2040 slightly higher at 3.5% per annum. Most of the expansion is expected to come from developing countries, with especially strong growth in India and China.

[Slide 6]
As a result of these trends, total primary energy demand is set to increase by 40%, reaching 382 mboe/d by 2040. Of this amount, 53% will still be satisfied by oil and gas. There is no doubt that oil will remain a fuel of choice for the foreseeable future.

[Slide 7]
Looking specifically at oil demand, it is expected to surpass 99 mb/d by 2021. It is then projected to climb to over 109 mb/d by 2040, an increase of 16.4 mb/d from 2015, which comes mainly from the road transportation sector, petrochemicals, and aviation. In parallel with energy growth, oil demand will rise most in developing countries.

[Slide 8]
Reflecting demand trends, supply will also undergo adjustments. Non-OPEC supply is expected to return to growth during 2017. It is currently anticipated to grow by 0.2 mb/d after a contraction of 0.7 mb/d in 2016. It is also expected to experience a further gradual recovery in the medium-term, reaching 58.6 mb/d by 2021, with most of the growth coming from Latin America, the US and Canada. In the longer term, US tight crude will remain a major source of growth until 2030, before declining. However, the supply outlook faces considerable uncertainty from factors such as cost, technology, geology, policies and geopolitical developments.

The contribution of OPEC crude oil to the global supply will remain robust and is expected to rise steadily to reach 41 mb/d by 2040, when the share of OPEC crude in the total world liquids supply will reach 37% – three percentage points higher than in 2015.

Ladies and gentlemen,

[Slide 9]
Understandably, these significant oil market developments will have strong implications for the downstream in both the medium- and long-term.

On the world scale, new required refining capacity will continue to mirror demand growth in developing regions, led by the Asia-Pacific, and will continue to move away from industrialized regions. Assessed project additions to 2021 total 7.3 mb/d of crude distillation capacity, compared with the existing base capacity at the beginning of 2016. It is also important to note that, in the medium-term, the capacity of secondary units follows the increase in distillation capacity.

Beyond current projects, further capacity requirements of 12.2 mb/d are projected by 2040, for a total of 19.5 mb/d of new crude distillation capacity requirements by the end of the forecast period.

Africa is one of the regions forecast to witness increasing refining capacity deficits over the next several years, and I know this is a subject being discussed widely in Nigeria. On the other hand, Africa is also expected to see a lot of new long-term additions that may help satisfy its growing demand. In fact, the continent is well positioned for downstream capacity additions.

Currently, the region imports about 30% of the refined products it consumes, making it by far the largest net product importing region. This is because of a combination of insufficient refining capacity and very low utilization rates in many facilities. Distillation capacity additions for Africa between 2016 and 2021 are expected to be around 0.6 mb/d. Some capacity expansion is likely to be forthcoming in Nigeria by 2020 through the rehabilitation of existing refineries and some grassroots projects.

The downstream is expected to face several uncertainties in the coming years, including the reaction of refiners to the need for capacity rationalization, changes in the quality of the global crude slate, and adopting to tight environmental regulations and product specifications. Additionally, lower oil prices in the past two years have led to many investors deferring projects, which may be re-considered if prices continue to recover.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to also dwell on one of the most important topics of our time – the issue of climate change within the context of the global energy transition. The policy changes resulting from climate change concerns have the potential to impact energy demand, as well as the overall energy mix and the future economy of oil.

OPEC Member Countries welcomed the Paris Agreement that resulted from COP 21 and indeed played an important role in reaching the Agreement. OPEC Member Countries will also play a leading role in its implementation – all 13 OPEC Member Countries have already signed the agreement and are in the process of ratifying it.

Additionally, OPEC has been working closely together with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to promote cooperation between the two bodies. This new and positive development resulted from a working visit I had with the UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa in October of last year in Bonn, Germany.

However, I want to reiterate that the implementation of this agreement should continue to be guided by the principles and provisions laid out by the UNFCCC, particularly the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. Equity is at the heart of the UNFCCC and subsequent COP Agreements. It is a core principle that holds together the sometimes competing aspirations of the people of the world represented at the COPs.

OPEC Member Countries, as developing country parties to the UNFCCC are not only impacted by the harsh realities of climate change with enormous impacts on our eco-systems, but equally face increasing severe unintended consequences from the policy programmes of developed country parties. It is important to therefore remember that oil and gas will continue to be the bedrock of our economies for the foreseeable future, despite the heroic efforts of our governments, in embarking on a variety of macro-economic reforms.

Finally, I want to refer to OPEC’s leading role in tackling sustainable development through its sister organization, the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID). Sustainable development and mass poverty, including energy poverty, are subjects we attach high priority, and OFID is doing a great deal on the African continent to tackle these issues, with projects in nearly 50 countries. The Organization – which celebrated its 40th birthday last year – helps these countries through public and private sector lending, trade financing and grants.

OFID’s resources consist of voluntary contributions made by OPEC Member Countries and the accumulated reserves derived from its various operations. At the close of the year 2015, cumulative commitments of the Organization topped US$16 billion and total disbursements were close to US$13 billion.

In conclusion, we should be conscious of our resources, we should use them effectively and efficiently to help support our development aspirations, uplift our economies and aid diversification.

OPEC is committed to sustainable stability for the benefit of both producers and consumers, and one of our most important tools to that end is dialogue. Sharing views and experiences with industry leaders is essential in building a stable and sustainable future.

I wish you useful exchanges and a successful exhibition.

Thank you for your time.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/177-28-february-2017.html"
"2017-02-27","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is truly a great pleasure for me to be here in Abuja – seeing old friends, reacquainting with former colleagues, and on this occasion, it is also an opportunity to thank those people and nations that have done so much to help bring forward the rebalancing of the global oil market and return sustainable stability to the industry.

​I would like to begin by thanking Nigeria’s President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari and the Nigerian Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, His Excellency Dr. Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu, the generous host of this evening’s event.

​The support, guidance and encouragement they have given to me, and to OPEC as an Organization, have been a tremendous help in allowing us to deliver the historic decisions that were taken by OPEC and non-OPEC nations at the end of 2016.

​It is also a great honour to have here this evening the Ambassadors of the other 23 participating nations to the landmark OPEC and non-OPEC decisions of 2016. The vision, leadership, courage and guidance of your esteemed Heads of States and governments, oil ministers and envoys to the complex process of bringing OPEC and non-OPEC nations together, and to agreeing on the decisions taken have been widely applauded. Together we have turned a historic page in the global oil industry.

​For me personally, I can safely say that when I assumed office as OPEC Secretary General back on August 1, 2016, I could not have envisaged what we have achieved over the past six months. Of course, I cannot stand here and say it was an easy process! It was an incredible challenge, a mammoth undertaking, but through a shared vision and a resolute strength of purpose we were able to achieve something that many thought was beyond us.

​There were many sceptics who proposed that OPEC Member Countries could not achieve unity among themselves. They were mistaken. And there were possibly even more sceptics who poured scorn on the idea that non-OPEC nations would join OPEC in the market rebalancing process. They were also mistaken.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​I would like to take this opportunity to describe to you in greater detail about how we reached last year’s landmark decisions. It is a story that needs telling, and retelling. I hope after I have finished that you feel able to also share with others.

​In 2016, it was evident that all producers, as well as consumers, were beginning to fully comprehend the gravity of the current oil cycle. There was an acknowledgement that stability on a sustainable basis had been absent from the industry for too long, to the detriment of producers, consumers, and the global economy.

​This unexpected instability was reflected in the sharp crude price decline observed between June 2014 and January 2016, when the OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an unprecedented 80 percent. It is the largest percentage fall in the five cycles of sharp price declines we have observed over the past three decades.

​There had been a sharp global inventory build between mid-2014 and the start of 2016 as supply outpaced demand. OECD commercial oil stock levels reached historic highs in early 2016, and for most of the year remained more than 300 million barrels above the five-year average, corresponding to around 800,000 b/d or 64 days of forward cover.

​In both 2015 and 2016, the industry witnessed a dramatic contraction in investments. Global oil and gas exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015 and a further 22 per cent in 2016 as well. Combined, this equates to above $300 billion. This was impacting not only new projects coming on-stream, but new discoveries too.

​The industry was also witnessing significant job losses, as well as increasing financial and operational stresses for many companies.

​To put it simply: the oil industry could not continue along this path. Something had to be done to tackle the major stresses that were suffocating the industry, and impacting current and future oil supplies.

​It led to OPEC embarking on the most extensive consultations among OPEC Member Countries and between OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations. At the same time, we also undertook deliberations with the broader international community and other multilateral organisations to further build consensus about the strategic urgency of restoring sustainable oil market stability in a collective manner.

​From Doha to Algiers, from Caracas to Tehran, from Baghdad to Riyadh, from Moscow to Istanbul. I felt I was flying more than an airline pilot!

​From OPEC’s perspective, this initially led to the ‘Algiers Accord’ that was agreed by all OPEC Member Countries at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algeria on September 28, 2016. The decision focused on the urgent need to stimulate the acceleration of the drawdown of the stock overhang, bring the market rebalancing forward and ensure that much needed investments return to the industry.

​The ‘Algiers Accord’ also initiated a process of consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, to establish a platform from where OPEC and non-OPEC producers could take pro-active measures that would ensure a balanced oil market on a sustainable basis.

​The challenge then was ensuring the ‘Algiers Accord’ was delivered in a full and timely manner.

​I can honestly say that the two-month period after the ‘Algiers Accord’ was the most intense period of talks and negotiations I have been involved in during my more than 30-year involvement with OPEC. Turning it into a lasting and viable solution for oil market stability took a great deal of hard work, diligence, courage and compromise from every OPEC Member Country and many non-OPEC producers too.

​Following two months of exhaustive and determined diplomacy efforts and consistent and encouraging advocacy in a variety of international energy platforms and fora, the ‘Vienna Agreement’, was adopted on November 30, 2016 in Vienna. This was followed soon after by the Declaration of Cooperation with non-OPEC countries on December 10.

​For the first time in the history of the industry, 13 OPEC nations and 11 non-OPEC participating countries, came together to help rescue and stabilize this strategic global industry – one that has been vital to the development of modern civilization.

​Through a shared vision by Heads of State and Government, Ministers, Ambassadors, and many officials from the 24 participating countries, collaborative and timely intervention was taken to address the prevailing market realities. Let me also stress that we want this OPEC and non-OPEC relationship to be a lasting and flexible partnership that when necessary can help reduce volatility, provide more confidence to the market, and steer a path towards more sustainable stability.

​The commitment made by the 24 nations was one to all oil industry stakeholders, both producers and consumers, as well as one to the broader global community, through the restoration of oil market stability and the potential positives of this for the global economy.

​Allow me here to put the importance of this in some context.

​Oil is perhaps the most strategic growth engine of the global economy. Currently more than 94 million barrels of oil are produced and consumed every day.

​In the industrialized world, oil has transformed economies and societies. The products derived from this precious natural resource are fundamental to daily lives.

​And we need to remember that many billions of people across the world continue to suffer from energy poverty. They need to benefit from the great advantages oil has brought to billions of others.

​The scale of the industry, and its potential, underscores the importance of sustainable oil market stability.

​The industry needs regular, timely and sustainable investment to guarantee security of supply to the global community. It is essential for our industry’s future and that of the global economy. It is essential to all those consumers around the world who rely on hydrocarbon resources for their everyday needs. And it will be essential to the future of those currently without access to modern energy services.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​As I am sure you all realize the historic decisions of last year are not the end of the process.

​To support the implementation, a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) has been established, which met for the first time in Vienna on January 22. The adoption of the framework for oversight and monitoring implementation, which now also involves a Joint Technical sub-Committee (JTC) that met for the first time on February 22 in Vienna, is both innovative and unique. At OPEC, we value the importance of data sharing, openness and transparency.

​The report of the JTC and the data for January shows conformity from participating OPEC nations above 90 per cent. Similarly, figures for non-OPEC nations have also proven to be positive.

​Looking ahead, I firmly believe that all countries involved remain resolute in the determination to achieve a higher level of conformity. Our common goal is 100 % conformity.

​We are already seeing more favourable conditions for the industry to deliver the necessary medium- and long-term investments for our energy future. Confidence is returning to the market. However, we cannot rest on our past successes; we need to continually strive to ensure that we push for the timely and full implementation of these decisions.

​The overall goal must remain on ensuring sustainable oil market stability. This is central to everything we do.

​We need stability – for investments and capacity expansion, to guarantee supply levels are adequate and sufficient, and to enable producers to respond quickly and appropriately in times of unexpected supply constraints.

​We need stability – for investors and producers to realize a fair return from the exploitation of their non-renewable resource.

​We need stability – for consumers to receive reliable and secure supplies.

​We need stability – for the market to react and respond to future unforeseen events.

​We need stability in all its forms. It guarantees a more balanced market today, which also guarantees a balanced market in the future.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​It was the legendary American football coach, Vince Lombardi, who said: “The achievements of an organization are the results of the combined effort of each individual.”

​That quote is very apt for what OPEC has achieved over the past six months, and what OPEC and non-OPEC has achieved too. The effort of many individuals has enabled us to accomplish great things.

​Thank you again for being here this evening. It has given me great pleasure to share with you the story of the historic and landmark decisions taken by us all at the end of 2016.

​I hope that this is just the beginning of a long and successful relationship between OPEC and non-OPEC nations.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/178-27-february-2017.html"
"2017-02-21","​Ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is a great pleasure to be in London for this year’s International Petroleum (IP) Week. I would like to thank the host of this prestigious conference, the Energy Institute, its Chief Executive, Louise Kingham, as well as the IP Week Programme Board, for the invitation to participate in this important and timely conference.

​The last time I spoke in London was at the Oil & Money conference in October 2016. It may only be four months ago, but from the perspective of OPEC, and the oil industry as a whole, a lot has happened in the intervening time.

​My discussions back in October 2016 were focused on OPEC’s ‘Algiers Accord’ adopted at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference on September 28. At this meeting, the OPEC Conference opted for an OPEC production target ranging between 32.5 and 33 million barrels a day (mb/d), in order to bring the market rebalancing forward.

​The focus and preoccupation was the unprecedented build-up of inventories over the period 2015/2016 that dislocated oil market fundamentals and sent oil prices plunging by as much as 80 per cent.

​The ‘Algiers Accord’ was a landmark achievement for the Organization and the industry, and I recall the optimism portrayed by His Excellency Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Energy, Industry & Mineral Resources who was speaking at the same October conference. However, I recall that in some quarters doubts were raised about whether OPEC could actually implement the ‘Algiers Accord’ in a full and timely manner.

​Scepticism was also voiced loudly about the ability of OPEC to bring non-OPEC producers on-board, following the decision in Algiers to develop a framework of high-level consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC.

​Despite this pessimism, OPEC embarked on the most extensive consultations among OPEC Member Countries and between OPEC and non-OPEC producing nations. At the same time, we also undertook deliberations with the broader international community and other multilateral organisations to further build consensus about the strategic urgency of restoring sustainable oil market stability.

​The intervening period between the ‘Algiers Accord’ on September 28 and the ‘Vienna Agreement’ on November 30 was no doubt one of the most challenging and intense periods in recent oil industry price cycles.

​The shuttle diplomacy that was undertaken across the world and the encouraging and consistent advocacy in a variety of international energy platforms and fora, facilitated consensus and commitment. This was crucial in the adoption of the ‘Vienna Agreement’ at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference and the Declaration of Cooperation with non-OPEC countries on December 10.

​For the first time in the history of the industry, 13 OPEC nations and 11 non-OPEC participating countries, led by the Russian Federation, came together to help rescue and stabilize this strategic global industry – one that has been vital to the development of modern civilization.

​To achieve this historic feat, our Heads of State and Government, Ministers, Ambassadors, and many officials from the 24 participating countries, both individually and collectively, played decisive roles in the run-up to these landmark decisions.

​Through a shared vision, among both OPEC and non-OPEC producers, collaborative and timely intervention was taken to address the prevailing market realities. It was a commitment to all oil industry stakeholders, both producers and consumers, as well as one to the broader global community, through the restoration of oil market stability and the potential positives of this for the global economy.

​To implement these timely decisions, a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) was also established, which met for the first time in Vienna on January 22. The adoption of the framework for oversight and monitoring implementation, which now also involves a Joint Technical sub-Committee that will meet for the first time on February 22 in Vienna, is both innovative and unique.

​They are also further prime examples of OPEC’s support for data sharing, openness and transparency. This is supported by the launch at the end of last year of the first-ever OPEC Annual Statistical Bulletin Smart App. This App makes the ASB’s content of OPEC data, as well as other international oil and gas data, available from any mobile device, at any time, on any day, from anywhere.

​In OPEC’s most recent Monthly Oil Market Report the production data for January shows conformity from participating OPEC nations above 90 per cent. Moreover, all countries involved remain resolute in the determination to achieve a higher level of conformity.

​We are also determined to realize the joint conference decision to strengthen and sustain this cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC. We want this to be a lasting and flexible partnership that when necessary can help reduce volatility, provide more confidence to the market, and steer a path towards more sustainable stability.

​In the short-term it is expected that this cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC, alongside recent indications of some improving macroeconomic conditions, will see the rebalancing process brought forward and more stability return to the market. I cannot over stress how vital this is, not only to the industry, but the global economy too.

​It was evident in the last quarter of 2016 that total OECD commercial oil stocks were falling, and it is expected that we will see a further drop during 2017, as a result of these decisions and developments. We will continue to focus on the level of inventory drawdown to bring the level closer to the five-year industry average.

​These decisions should also mean that prices stabilize at levels that are more conducive to the kind of investments the industry needs, specifically by lessening the financial and operational stresses for companies and reducing the pressure to cancel or postpone planned projects. We believe as the market rebalances the price will find its equilibrium.

​The gravity of the sharp contraction in oil industry investment is underscored in the fact that in both 2015 and 2016 we witnessed a dramatic rationalization of projects. Global oil and gas exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015 and a further 22 per cent drop in 2016. Combined, this equates to above $300 billion. This has impacted new projects coming on-stream and new discoveries too.

​To put it simply: the industry cannot afford to see investment levels fall for a third year in a row! 

​Stability today is also vital for stability in the future, given that the oil industry is very much a medium- to long-term business.

​Moreover, the industry remains a growth business. We see the world requiring more oil in the years ahead. Oil will remain a fuel of choice for the foreseeable future.

​In OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook, oil is still expected to supply over 26 per cent of the world’s energy demand by 2040. Oil demand increases by around 17 mb/d between 2015 and 2040 to reach close to 110 mb/d.

​This will require significant investments. And new barrels are needed to not only increase production, but also to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. Overall, we see oil-related investment requirements of around $10 trillion over the period to 2040.

​The industry needs regular, timely and sustainable investment to guarantee security of supply to the global community. It is essential for our industry’s future and that of the global economy. It is essential to all those consumers around the world who rely on hydrocarbon resources for their everyday needs. And it will be essential to the future of those currently without access to modern energy services.

​In this regard, we should not forget that today 2.7 billion people still rely on biomass for their basic needs, and 1.3 billion have no access to electricity. The energy transition should take this global challenge into account.

​It is also important to note where we expect these future supplies to come from. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook, it is projected that non-OPEC liquids production will see a recovery in the medium-term, after dropping considerably in 2016. However, it plateaus over the next decade, reaching 61.4 mb/d in 2027, before declining to 58.9 mb/d by 2040.

​In the long-term it is OPEC that will be required to meet much of the expected additional demand. In terms of crude, OPEC’s supply is estimated to increase to 41 mb/d by 2040, an increase of around 9 mb/d from 2016, while non-OPEC is anticipated to witness an overall decline of 2 mb/d. In terms of all liquids, the increase for OPEC is close to 12 mb/d from 2016, and for non-OPEC there is growth of about 3 mb/d.

​It means that the estimated share of OPEC crude in the total world liquids supply in 2040 is 37 per cent, which is three percentage points higher than the 2015 level.

​To meet its obligations as a secure and reliable supplier of oil to world markets, OPEC Member Countries remain committed to investing in new capacity and necessary infrastructure, despite the downturn we have witnessed in the last couple of years.

​We believe that the recent decisions taken by OPEC and non-OPEC are already creating the favourable conditions for the industry to deliver the necessary medium- and long-term investments for our energy future.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​There are, however, many other challenges for oil markets, such as: the prospects for the global economy; excessive speculation and the role of financial markets; the impact of geopolitics; advances in technology and their impacts on exploration and production; policy uncertainties in a number of leading producing and consuming countries; and environmental and sustainable development concerns.

​Allow me to share with you our views and perspectives with regard to a major topical issue of our time – climate change. It obviously has the potential to impact energy demand, the overall energy mix and the future economy of oil.

​Let me stress that OPEC not only welcomed the Paris Agreement on climate change from COP 21 and its early enforcement toward the end of 2016. Our Member Countries played an important role in reaching the Agreement – and they will also play a role in its implementation.

​All 13 OPEC Member Countries have signed the Agreement and all are in the process of ratifying it.

​I should also highlight here that I visited Bonn in October 2016 to meet with Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to enhance cooperation between the UNFCCC and OPEC. This collaboration is a new and positive development that was welcomed by the UNFCCC.

​It is vital, however, to remember that the implementation of the Paris Agreement should continue to be guided by the principles and provisions that were provided for in the UNFCCC. The unique situation of developing countries, in particular, should be given the priority it deserves, including those developing countries dependent on oil.

​In terms of the energy mix, we can expect to see a further shift towards renewables in the coming decades. Let me stress that OPEC is greatly supportive of the development of renewables. Many of our countries have vast sources of solar and wind, and significant investments are being made in these fields.

​Of course, we also acknowledge the challenges of emissions that come from burning fossil fuels. In this regard, we recognize the need to use energy efficiently and to continually look to develop and adopt cleaner energy technologies, such as carbon capture and storage and many others in the future. I am a believer that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions. In this regard, I welcome coordinated action with the industry and through various research and development platforms.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​We remain optimistic about a sustainable future for oil. We believe it will continue to play a central role in helping provide heat, light and mobility to billions of people across the world, and we believe it will continue to help drive the economies and the diversification of our Member Countries.

​The focus needs to be on sustainable oil market stability. It is the concern that links us all.

​Stability is vital for security of supply and security of demand, which are in turn both vital to stable investments and future capacity expansion. This is beneficial to both producers and consumers.

​To put it simply: oil market stability is one of the central pillars of a well-functioning global economy.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/179-21-february-2017.html"
"2017-02-15","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:

​It is a pleasure to be here in Riyadh for this seventh edition of the IEA-IEF-OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.

​I would like to begin by acknowledging with deep appreciation His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud and thank him and his esteemed delegation to OPEC for their ongoing support and leadership not only within OPEC but also in connection with the important meetings of the International Energy Forum, such as this gathering here today.

​This year, Saudi Arabia holds the Presidency of the OPEC Conference, and therefore, we are fortunate to benefit from the leadership of His Excellency Khalid Al-Falih, Minister of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources, who will lead OPEC’s efforts in the crucial months ahead as we continue to promote stability in the global oil market. Khalid Al Falih brings with him a reservoir of knowledge, rich industry experience and a fountain of wisdom to his new style OPEC responsibilities.

​I would also like to recognize Dr. Ibrahim Al Muhanna, Senior Advisor to HE Mr. Al-Falih, who is here today to deliver welcoming remarks on behalf of this fine Host Country of Saudi Arabia. He is an industry veteran and an accomplished oil technocrat.

​We have three esteemed oil ministers with us here today whom I would like to recognize. They are: His Excellency Shaikh Mohamed bin Khalifa bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, Minister of Oil of Bahrain, as well as His Excellency Abdul Rahman Dahlan, Malaysian Minister in Charge of the Prime Minister’s Economic Planning Office and His Excellency Mohamed Zayed Awad Mousa, Minister of Petroleum of Sudan. Today’s deliberations will surely benefit from their deep experience and expert knowledge of this complex and ever dynamic industry.

​This is my first time attending this Symposium since I assumed office as OPEC Secretary General last August. And, I am happy, or should I say, relieved that I am not the only neophyte here today. His Excellency Sun Xiansheng took office as the new Secretary General of the International Energy Forum on the same day I started at OPEC in Vienna, so he joins me in making his debut at this event here today.

​Dr. Sun had already renamed me his African twin brother, way back in Algiers in September 2016.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Since last year’s meeting of this Symposium, the market has continued to recover from the price crash that occurred in mid-2014, when we witnessed prices plummet by a stunning 80%.

​The effects of this dramatic event sent shock waves throughout the oil and gas industry, and indeed the global economy. Thousands upon thousands of jobs were lost, budgets were slashed, projects were cancelled or deferred, investments were frozen or discontinued, and some companies went into bankruptcy.

​Global spending on exploration and production dropped by around 26 per cent in 2015, and decreased by an additional 22 per cent in 2016. Altogether, this amounts to more than $300 billion in lost investment. Three years of continued contraction of investments in the oil industry is unprecedented.

​This is a worrisome scenario when you consider that a massive $10 trillion in oil-related investments is estimated to be required in the period to 2040 in order to meet future world energy demand.

​In today’s oil market, the industry would find it challenging to meet this level of investment.

​These factors were what compelled OPEC to take action. We understood that the risks for not acting were simply too dire.

​This was the state of affairs when I took office in August, so we decided to initiate a series of consultations with our Member Countries to figure out a solution to this challenging situation.

​This intensive round of shuttle diplomacy came to a head in September 2016, when the Algiers Accord was adopted at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in the Algerian capital. This, as you know, happened on the sidelines of the IEF Ministerial Meeting. The Algiers Accord addressed the urgent need to accelerate the drawdown of the stock overhang in order to expedite the market rebalancing process and reinstate the required investment levels in the industry.

​The Accord also opened up a new round of bilateral and multilateral consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC producers that resulted in the landmark decision, Vienna Agreement, adopted at the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Vienna and on the 30th of November.

​Then, on the 10th of December, a joint OPEC-non-OPEC ministerial-level meeting was held at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, culminating in the Declaration of Cooperation in which 24 OPEC Member Countries and non-OPEC countries decided to voluntarily adjust their production by around 1.8 million barrels per day, a unified effort to help accelerate the realignment of global oil supply and demand.

​As part of the Declaration, a Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee was established to develop a framework for monitoring the agreed-upon adjustments in production.

​As you know, we recently concluded the inaugural Ministerial Monitoring Committee Meeting at the OPEC Secretariat on the 22nd of January, and I am pleased to inform you that it was a resounding success. The Committee unanimously agreed on the terms and conditions of the monitoring framework and will hold its first monthly consultations next week, issuing a report on the progress towards the implementation of OPEC’s 171st Ministerial Conference decision and the Declaration of Cooperation.

​The latest market developments that will be shared here today reflect the strong level of commitment for expediting the market rebalancing process.

​These concerted efforts by the both OPEC and non-OPEC producers are already having a positive impact on the market as we see the onset of a more bullish sentiment emerging in the market.

​Prices have reversed their downward trend with the OPEC Reference Basket recovering to the highest levels since July 2015 to stand above $50 per barrel.

​The market structure is showing the first signs of a transition from a contango into backwardation, which could occur in the second half of this year.

​Crude futures have rallied sharply to their highest levels in 18 months, and money mangers’ bets on prices have reached new highs, providing an additional boost to ongoing gains in prices.

​Additionally, we have seen rising economic output, improved labour markets and increasing inflation in some key advanced economies.

​This is all good news for the industry, and gives us a confirmation that we are moving in the right direction towards achieving our common goal of restoring market stability and reviving much needed investment.

​Please note, though, that these efforts should not merely be viewed through a short-term lense, but rather with a long-term perspective. The oil and gas industry depends on massive long-term investments in research, development and production to ensure its future.

​Today, as in previous instalments of this gathering, we will have an opportunity to listen to a wide spectrum of views on the future energy outlook—from OPEC’s perspective, from the consumer nation’s viewpoint through the International Energy Agency, and also from the industry standpoint. We will also benefit from a special address to be delivered by Her Excellency Shamshad Akhtar, Under Secretary General of the United Nations and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.

​My colleagues from the OPEC Secretariat will be presenting to you our short, medium and long-term outlooks.

​The longer-term outlooks are based on research that was published in 2016 special 10th anniversary edition of the World Oil Outlook, which, for a decade now, has been providing comprehensive analysis of key industry dynamics while providing keen insights into the challenges and uncertainties the industry faces.

​2016 was a milestone year for the WOO, so to mark the occasion, we launched it, for the first time ever, in an OPEC Member Country, at the 2016 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference, ADIPEC, in the United Arab Emirates.

​In looking at some of the key findings, total primary energy demand worldwide is set to grow by 40 per cent in the period to 2040. Though the share of fossil fuels in the overall energy mix is expected to fall by 2040, oil will continue to be the fuel of choice for many years to come.

​In fact, oil demand is forecast to rise to over 109 million barrels of oil per day by 2040, an increase of over 16 million barrels a day. The majority of this demand will come from road transportation, petrochemicals and aviation, and developing countries will see the highest growth levels.

​As I alluded to earlier, any expansion in demand will obviously require significant industry investments, and new barrels will be required to boost production while also accommodating for decline rates at existing fields.

​Another key area to consider is transportation. Looking at today’s agenda, I am pleased to see that there will be a session in the afternoon devoted to this key issue.

​Almost every day, we read reports about the rise of alternative fuel vehicles, and how rapidly the technology in this sector is changing. There is some truth to this, but it will not happen overnight.

​The WOO 2016 projects that nearly a third of the long-term increase in oil demand will be derived from the transportation sector.

​This growth will be driven by the increasing fleet of cars around the world, especially in developing countries. In fact, the total number of passenger cars is expected to more than double between 2015 and 2040, reaching almost 2.1 billion.

​However, one thing to consider is that the car fleet will also change, and the WOO estimates a rapid penetration of non-conventional vehicles, which are expected to increase from 3% of the overall fleet in 2014 to nearly 22% by 2040, with most of the growth coming from battery electric vehicles.

​Taking this into account, we will continue to focus eyes on future developments in this area as they will be important in shaping the future of our industry.

​I will leave it to my colleagues to fill you in on the remaining key findings from the Outlook during their presentations this morning.

​Let me just add that this important publication is part of our quest to more clearly identify market drivers, challenges and uncertainties, and to better understand the potential impact of policies, technology and environmental concerns.

​We also see the Outlook as a means to enhance data transparency in the market, making OPEC’s analysis and forecasting available to all stakeholders. Through this, we hope to contribute to a deeper knowledge of oil market complexities, both in the upstream and the downstream.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​We are currently in the midst of a great deal of uncertainty in the world, not only in our industry, but also in the wider political context, that also potentially provides historic opportunities.

​During my recent trips to the United States for a week of high-level meetings and speaking engagements and to Davos for the World Economic Forum, these issues were discussed at length. There was much speculation as to what the future might hold. But, as you know, none of us has a crystal ball, and no one can predict the future.

​With this in mind, I cannot overemphasize the importance of ongoing dialogue and cooperation.

​OPEC already has an extensive list of bilateral and multilateral energy dialogues we hold annually with international stakeholders, including the European Union, Russia, China, India, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the G20 and, of course, with the IEF, the IEA and international oil companies.

​On my trip last December to the United States, I extended an invitation also to key industry stakeholders in the United States to join us for a new era of collaboration and dialogue, so that we can work together towards our mutually beneficial goal of ensuring stability in the world energy markets, in the interest of producers, consumers and the global oil industry.

​Thank you for your attention, and I wish you all fruitful deliberations today.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/180-15-february-2017.html"
"2016-12-15","​Ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is a great honour to be asked to deliver a keynote address at such a distinguished seat of learning as Columbia University. It is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York, it was founded by royalty, specifically King George II of England, and it is home to the annually awarded Pulitzer Prize honouring excellence in journalism and the arts.

​That is some list, and this does not even mention the notable alumni that include some of the Founding Fathers of the United States, three US Presidents, other Heads of State, Supreme Court Justices, Academy Award winners and Nobel laureates.

​It is also a privilege to be at the university’s Center on Global Energy Policy, one of the leading global institutions for energy dialogue and policy. Given recent events in the oil market, it’s obviously an extremely interesting time for energy dialogue and debate. I hope to be able to highlight some of the most pertinent viewpoints of our Organization’s outlook over both the short- and long-term.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​When Columbia University was founded back in 1754, the modern petroleum industry had not even been born. It would be more than 100 years before what many believe to be the first commercial oil well was drilled. Edwin Drake’s 1859 well that was drilled using a steam engine near Titusville, Pennsylvania, is widely believed to be the first modern oil well and one that ushered in the first major oil boom, the dawn of a new era of industrialization and prosperity.

​It is interesting to note that this oil well initially yielded just 25 barrels per day. Oil was then seen as a somewhat obscure commodity, but today its existence is vital to billions of people across the world. Although I should underline here that there remain 1.3 billion of people that still have no access to modern energy services. It is critical that energy poverty is eradicated, one of the pillars of the UN sustainable development goals. I have no doubt that oil has a strategic role, in this regard.

​Today, the size, scope, and complexity of the global oil market make it almost unique among physical commodities. Currently more than 94 million barrels of oil are produced and consumed every day. Beyond the magnitude of this trade, the vital importance of oil and the crucial role that it plays in globally makes it perhaps the most strategic growth engine of the global economy.

​The true scale of the industry and its strategic value to both producers and consumers underscores the importance of sustainable oil market stability.

​Stability is vital for producers in terms of security of demand. Stability is vital for consumers in terms of security of supply. Stability is vital for all industry stakeholders.

​Over the past couple of years, however, stability on a sustainable basis has been absent from the industry, to the detriment of producers, consumers, and the global economy.

​This is reflected in the sharp crude price decline observed between June 2014 and January 2016, when the OPEC Reference Basket price fell by an unprecedented 80 percent. It is the largest percentage fall in the five cycles of sharp price declines we have observed over the past three decades.

​We have seen supply outpace demand, which led to a sharp global inventory build between mid-2014 and the start of 2016. This year OECD commercial oil stock levels have seen little change, but they still remain more than 300 million barrels above the five-year average. Moreover, we have seen a rise in non-OECD inventories, plus an expansion in some non-OECD strategic petroleum reserves.

​In both 2015 and 2016, we have witnessed a dramatic contraction in oil industry investments. For example, global oil and gas exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015 and a further 22 per cent drop is anticipated in 2016. Combined, this equates to above $300 billion. This will impact not only new projects coming on-stream, but new discoveries too.

​And we have witnessed significant job losses across the industry, as well as increasing financial and operational stresses for many companies.

​In 2016 it has been evident that all producers, as well as most consumers, have come to comprehend the gravity of the current oil cycle.

​Throughout 2016 there have been numerous bilateral and multilateral meetings and consultations concerning these challenges. These consultations gathered pace in August 2016 with many OPEC Ministers, non-OPEC Ministers, as well as some Heads of State and Governments engaging in the process of rebalancing the oil market, and expressing their views on the need to see sustainable stability return.

​From OPEC’s perspective, this led to the ‘Algiers Accord’ that was agreed by all OPEC Member Countries at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algeria on September 28. The agreement focused on the urgent need to stimulate the acceleration of the drawdown of the stock overhang, bring the market rebalancing forward and ensure that much needed investments return to the industry.

​The Accord reaffirmed OPEC’s continued commitment to stable markets, in the interests of both producers and consumers.

​Moreover, it also initiated a process of consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, to establish a platform from where OPEC and non-OPEC producers could take pro-active measures that would ensure a balanced oil market on a sustainable basis.

​I am sure everyone here can appreciate the road to success is not always easy to navigate. Turning the ‘Algiers Accord’ into a lasting and viable solution for oil market stability took a great deal of hard work, commitment, courage and compromise from every OPEC Member Country and many non-OPEC producers too. Following two months of intensive and determined efforts since the ‘Algiers Accord’, September 28, the ‘Vienna Agreement’, was adopted on November 30, 2016 in Vienna.

​This landmark decision by OPEC, as well as the pledge made by a number of non-OPEC producers at a joint ministerial-level meeting in Vienna on December 10, underlines a shared and deep resolve to return much needed stability to the market, and the industry, as a whole.

​Through a shared vision, among both OPEC and non-OPEC producers, collaborative and reasoned action was taken to address the prevailing market realities. It was a commitment to all oil industry stakeholders, as well as one to the broader global community through the restoration of oil market stability and the potential positives of this for the global economy.

​It is also important to highlight that these recent decisions should not only be viewed as a short-term necessity. Yes, the short-term is in all of our minds, but as we all know, this is very much a medium- to long-term business. We need to view these actions as vital to long-term oil market stability.

​The value of this is readily apparent in OPEC’s recently launched tenth edition of its World Oil Outlook, which provides comprehensive analysis of key industry dynamics, as well as detailed insights into the challenges and uncertainties the industry faces.

​The 2016 edition of the Outlook shows that oil demand is estimated to reach over 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040, an increase of over 16 million barrels a day.

​This expansion will obviously require significant investments. Moreover, new barrels are needed to not only increase production, but also to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. Overall, we see oil-related investment requirements of around $10 trillion over the period to 2040.

​This investment figure puts the need for sustainable market stability in stark perspective.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​The experience of 2016 has shown us that the importance of cooperation and dialogue between all oil industry stakeholders has never been greater. We believe that our future will increasingly be one of energy interdependence. We do not live in a world of independent energy nations.

​It all points to the need to continually enhance dialogue and cooperation, with innovative thinking, collaboration and swift action between stakeholders, where and when appropriate. This lies behind our established and evolving dialogues with the European Union, China, India, Russia, other non-OPEC producers, the International Energy Agency, the International Energy Forum, the International Monetary Fund, the G-20, and others.

​In the context of this vision, OPEC sees benefits in exploring and initiating an energy dialogue with the US. We believe this engagement is vitally important to all. The US is currently the number one liquids producer at around 13.6 million barrels a day, the number one consumer, at just over 20 million barrels a day, the number one importer of liquids at about 9.6 million barrels a day, and the number three exporter of liquids, at around 4.6 million barrels a day.

​What is in all of our interests is the one word I have uttered on many occasions since I became Secretary General. And that word is ‘stability’.

​Stability is central to everything we do. It is the overarching concern that links us all.

​We need stability – for investments and capacity expansion, to guarantee supply levels are adequate and sufficient, and to enable producers to respond quickly and appropriately in times of unexpected supply constraints.

​We need stability – for investors and producers to realize a fair return from the exploitation of their non-renewable resource.

​We need stability – for consumers to receive reliable and secure supplies.

​We need stability – for the market to react and respond to future unforeseen events.

​We need stability in all its forms. It guarantees a more balanced market today, which also guarantees a balanced market in the future.

​On this point, I would like to thank you for your attention, and hand the floor to my colleague, Dr. Jorge Leon, who will present a more detailed overview of the 2016 OPEC World Oil Outlook.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/181-15-december-2016.html"
"2016-12-13","​Ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning to you all.

​Allow me to begin by thanking Thomas Pritzker, CSIS Chairman; John Hamre, CSIS President and CEO, as well as John Hess from the CSIS Board of Trustees for this opportunity to speak with you here today and offer OPEC’s perspectives on the current and future outlooks for the world energy markets.

​After my remarks, Dr. Jorge Leon from our Energy Studies Department will take you through some of the key findings from our 10th World Oil Outlook, which was released last month at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference.

​Let me say that we are honoured to be here at this prestigious institute of international policy and research, which now has more than half a century of experience in providing leaders with strategic insight and advice on world affairs. We commend you on the valuable and often groundbreaking work you have produced over the years, and that you continue to do today.

​Before coming here, I had a look at your event schedule of the last months and was pleased to see that CSIS recently hosted two very prominent members of the OPEC family.

​His Excellency, Ali I. Al-Naimi, former Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, was here in April and more recently in early December in 2016 to share his views on the dynamic changes in the global energy markets. He undoubtedly also spoke about his compelling life story and his illustrious career at the top echelons of the oil industry, which are now all captured in his new book entitled: “Out of the Desert: My Journey from Nomadic Bedouin to the Heart of Global Oil.” This is a must-read for anyone in our field of energy.

​Although he has now retired, he is still remembered and appreciated at OPEC for his countless contributions in steadfastly guiding his country and our Organization through several very challenging energy cycles. He has tirelessly devoted his efforts to promoting stability and growth in the international oil and gas industry.

​I also noticed that His Excellency Khalid A. Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s current Minister of Energy, spoke here last June on the Saudi-US relationship as well as on Vision 2030, the Kingdom’s ambitious long-term plan to transition the country to a diversified and sustainable economy.

​Though Mr. Naimi was a hard act to follow, Mr. Al-Falih has taken over the reins and is providing excellent leadership both as Energy Minister in the Kingdom and as Head of Delegation at OPEC—this was evident over the last weeks as he played a key role in helping OPEC reach its key consensus decisions both in Algiers and in Vienna.

​Our presentation here at CSIS is part of a week-long United States visit. On the 12th of December, we had very engaging discussions at IHS Markit and the International Monetary Fund, and on the 14th and 15th of December, we look forward to meetings with the US Energy Information Administration and Columbia University in New York City.

​It is a distinct honour to be here in this vast and beautiful country, which has played such a pivotal role in the history of our industry. The United States is considered the home of the first commercially drilled oil well. Thanks to the genius and ingenuity of Edwin Drake, oil was extracted from a deep well near Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1859, sparking an oil boom that would take the world by storm.

​It goes unsaid that the United States—as one of the world’s largest oil and gas consumers—is of utmost importance to OPEC. We estimate that it imports 3.6 million barrels a day of liquids from OPEC’s Member Countries. And this is out of a total US consumption of 20 million barrels a day. This makes the United States a vital customer for our Member Countries.

​Thus, it is my hope that our meetings and consultations here this week will open up a new cycle of ongoing dialogue between our Organization and the United States. Both parties have nothing to lose and everything to gain with this type of cooperation—it is a true win-win scenario.

​Over the previous years, I have had the opportunity to spend quite a bit of time here in Washington, mainly pursuing my academic goals in higher education.

​Today, though, I return here for a different reason and in a different capacity. This time, I come as the leader of one of the world’s most influential energy organizations, and one, which has recently proven that it is as relevant today as when it was founded in Baghdad in September of 1960.

​In the last few years, there has been talk that perhaps OPEC was no longer important and that it had possibly lost the key role it has played in the world of energy since its founding.

​Well, ladies and gentlemen, I am here to report to you that OPEC is alive and well.

​Any naysayers that may have had doubts about OPEC’s efficacy were proven wrong with the historic decision that was made by OPEC’s Heads of Delegation at the last OPEC Ministerial Conference on the 30th of November in Vienna.

​I am referring to what we now call the Vienna Agreement, which was the OPEC Conference’s decision to implement a new OPEC production target of 32.5 million barrels a day. This is a reduction of around 1.2 million barrels a day.

​The goal of this agreement is to accelerate the ongoing drawdown of the stock overhang and to expedite the rebalancing of the market.

​This is the first production adjustment OPEC has made since 2008, when the OPEC Conference met in Oran, Algeria and decided to adjust production to help ease the adverse impacts of declining prices.

​It is also the first time since 1998 that Iraq is part of the production management process. It has been exempted from this role due to the geopolitical challenges it has faced in the past years.

​And finally, this agreement marks the first time non-OPEC countries have joined OPEC in a concerted effort to help bring stability back to the market.

​The achievement of this important agreement is the culmination of months of intensive consultations held among OPEC Member Countries and also between OPEC and non-OPEC Member countries.

​I personally have travelled the world in recent weeks to meet with leaders of OPEC and non-OPEC countries in order to help build support and foster a spirit of dialogue and cooperation.

​The many miles of travel and the countless hours spent in meeting rooms all paid off when we reached our initial accord in Algiers, which was adopted at the 170th Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference held in the Algerian capital on the 28th of September. This then became the Algiers Accord, which, we now know, has been approved for implementation as part of the Vienna Agreement.

​So, why, you may ask, is this all so important? Well, to answer that, let me take you back to 2014, when this current down-cycle began.

​In June of 2014, in the midst of an oversupplied market, we saw oil prices plummet, dropping to a low of $20 per barrel in early 2016. This constitutes an enormous decline of 80%.

​The chilling effect of this price crash was felt throughout the oil and gas industry. Thousands upon thousands of jobs were lost, budgets were slashed, projects were deferred or cancelled, investment was frozen or discontinued, and some producers went into bankruptcy.

​Global spending on exploration and production dropped by around 26 per cent in 2015, and is expected to decrease by an additional 22 per cent this year. Altogether, this amounts to more than $300 billion in lost investment.

​This trend is on track to continue into a third year, which would be unprecedented in the history of the oil industry.

​This is a frightening situation when you consider that a massive $10 trillion in oil-related investments is estimated to be required in the period to 2040 in order to meet future world energy demand.

​In today’s oil market, the industry would simply not be able to meet this level of investment.

​These factors were the reason the OPEC Heads of Delegation decided it was time to take action, and that the risks for not acting were dire.

​Let me emphasize that OPEC Member Countries remain absolutely committed to ensuring the long-term supply of the market. They continue to invest in both their upstream and downstream sectors despite the spike in costs and the shortage of adequately skilled labour.

​This is good news for the industry, as world oil demand is set to rise dramatically in the years to come.

​According to our recently published 10th edition of the World Oil Outlook 2016, global demand is forecast to rise by nearly 17 million b/d until 2040 – at which time it could reach around 110 million b/d.

​So, you see, the world’s oil producers, including OPEC, have their work cut out for them if they intend to meet the world’s future energy requirements. But, to achieve this, they need a fair oil price and a stable market, which will provide fertile ground for the necessary investment in production and research and development.

​One thing is for sure, though: OPEC cannot achieve this alone. Only through collaborative efforts and open dialogue with fellow stakeholders will we meet with success.

​OPEC already has an extensive list of bilateral and multilateral meetings it holds annually with international stakeholders, including the European Union, Russia, China, India, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the G20, the International Energy Agency and the International Energy Forum.

​We hope now that the United States will join us for a new era of collaboration and dialogue, so that we can work together towards our mutually beneficial goal of ensuring stability in the world energy markets. These conditions will contribute to economic growth and prosperity, two things we all desire for this and future generations.

​Thank you for your attention, and I will now give the floor to Dr. Leon, who will give his presentation on the World Oil Outlook.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/182-13-december-2016.html"
"2016-12-12","​Distinguished guests,
​Ladies and gentlemen,
​Good afternoon.

​It is very good to be here again. I’d like to thank you all for coming. I am looking forward to exchange of views – not only on recent oil market developments but on their potential impact on the global economy.

​OPEC and the International Monetary Fund benefit from having a long and cordial relationship. You might even say that there is a ‘partnership’ in place, forged in part through OPEC’s regular participation in the annual IMF/World Bank meetings.

​In addition, the IMF’s rigorous analysis of global economic and financial conditions informs OPEC’s forecasts and outlooks for the short-, medium- and long-term, especially as embodied in our World Oil Outlook.

​Our two organizations also share something important: a preoccupation with stability.

​The loans and technical assistance the IMF provides to developing countries – including OPEC Member Countries – are based on rigorous analytical work with the aim of fostering financial stability. And over the years, the IMF’s swift action and practical advice has not only prevented smaller problems from becoming global crises but has helped instil discipline in situations of neglect. ‘Stability’ has been your watchword.

​At OPEC, we abide by the same watchword. Our consensus-based decisions – which are informed by our own research and analytical work – are also designed to bring stability. And our actions – which result from negotiations among our Member Countries – are designed to foster discipline when global market conditions are often agitated or disordered.

​Consider the work that OPEC did recently in the context of a very unbalanced oil market. For several months, we worked tirelessly to consult with the world’s oil producers – both OPEC and non-OPEC. These efforts paid off – and we were able to reach a consensus to bring much-needed stability back to the market with an effective decision on oil production levels. This is the “Vienna Agreement” of the 30th of November.

​It would be opportune to give you a brief overview of the broad consultative process that led to this Agreement.

​The first phase of negotiations, which took place at the 170th Meeting of the OPEC Conference in late September, led to what is called the “Algiers Accord”.

​This embodied an agreement by OPEC Member Countries to cut production for the first time in eight years – to between 32.5 million and 33 million barrels per day. The means of implementation were left to a High-level Committee of OPEC Members.

​At the same time, OPEC began extensive bilateral and multilateral consultations and discussions. This was careful, delicate, time-consuming work. And it culminated in the historic Vienna Agreement at the end of November – the first production adjustment since the Oran Decision of 2008.

​The Vienna Agreement successfully implements a production adjustment with a target of 32.5 million barrels per day. Scheduled to go into effect on the 1st of January 2017, the Agreement is expected to accelerate the ongoing drawdown of the stock overhang and bring the oil market rebalancing forward.

​The Vienna Agreement is note-worthy because it includes the participation of all Member Countries – some of them for the first time since 1998.

​The Agreement demonstrates the unity, flexibility and cohesion of our Member Countries.

​The Vienna Agreement also institutionalizes a framework for structured cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries on a regular and sustainable basis. This is appropriate, since the process leading to the Agreement included the participation of non-OPEC countries. They repeatedly declared their resolve to achieving a fast-tracked realignment of global supply and demand.

​In fact, this past Saturday, we had a joint ministerial-level meeting with eleven non-OPEC producers. The discussions demonstrated a shared commitment to rebalance the market and to see a return to ‘sustainable stability’. It now remains to be seen exactly how we move forward for broader implementation of the Agreement.

​In the meantime, it is worth remembering that the Vienna Agreement has positive implications for the global economy, the oil industry and oil producing countries.

​First, there are important, beneficial and well-established links between oil and the global economy.

​We explored this the last time we visited the IMF in October, which coincided with the G24 Ministerial Meeting. This was right on the heels of the Algiers Accord, which was a necessary step – not only in our efforts to accelerate the drawdown of the stock overhang but to reduce volatility in the medium- and long-term.

​It had been also noted the weaker-than-desired global growth, the sharp decline in investments and the considerable negative impact this was having on the energy sector of major economies. While other key dynamics across the globe were also of concern at the time, reaching a successful decision to stabilize the oil market would provide enough positive support to global economic activity.

​In short, the central message was that unless a production agreement was reached, global economic growth was likely to remain quite modest in the short-term.

​It was not just a question of supporting global economic growth and helping to incentivize investments to the energy sector – and thereby supporting GDP growth. It was also a question of helping central banks achieve their inflation targets and supporting the labour market by helping to create jobs. The Vienna Agreement contributes to an improvement in conditions in all these areas.

​Second, there is the Agreement’s beneficial impact on the oil industry.

​The Vienna Agreement means that prices will stabilize to levels that are more conducive to the kind of investments that the industry needs. This not only ensures that it will remain dynamic but that it will be able to meet future demand levels.

​The Agreement also reduces the pressure to cancel or postpone planned investments in the upstream, while also ensuring that the necessary investments in capacity expansion – to offset decline rates, for example – will continue.

​Related to this is my third point: that the Vienna Agreement will have a beneficial effect on the overall economic performance of oil producing countries.

​The Agreement strengthens their hydrocarbons sector and supports the livelihoods of those working in the sector.

​It also ensures that the oil industries in producing countries shall regain some of their dynamism – which, in turn, helps them to operate once more with the expectation of generating sufficient oil revenues.

​These are all points worth keeping in mind – especially when one remembers that OPEC’s Member Countries are all developing countries. Together they represent a share of about 8 percent of the global economy and, to a large degree, their budgets depend on oil revenues.

​As we look ahead to the short-, medium- and long-term, we continue to closely monitor oil market developments. We do this with an appreciation for what the Vienna Agreement has already achieved – and with an understanding of the conditions and challenges elaborated in our flagship publication, the World Oil Outlook, now in its 10th edition.

​Now, I would like to share you with a few observations from this year’s edition, before Dr. Jorge León, a member of our Research Division at the OPEC Secretariat, gives you a more in-depth presentation.

​Our 2016 Outlook analyses the impact of the current industry cycle on investments – particularly in 2015 and 2016. Although global spending on exploration and production is expected to fall slightly less this year than last year, the combined amount for the two years represents a loss of more than $300 billion.

​In terms of total primary energy demand worldwide, the Outlook sees it growing by 40 percent in the period to 2040. And while fossil fuels are expected to see their share in the energy mix fall by 2040, oil shall remain the fuel of choice for many more years to come.

​In fact, oil demand is expected to reach 109 million barrels per day. The bulk of this oil demand growth is seen coming from the road transportation, petrochemicals and aviation sectors. And developing countries will continue to lead much of this growth.

​There are many other features worth highlighting. But I shall leave that for my colleague to elaborate on. However, I would like to quickly note that World Oil Outlook responds to various needs.

​First of all, it is part of our quest to more clearly identify market drivers, challenges and uncertainties, and to better understand the potential impact of policies, technology, and environmental concerns.

​In addition, the Outlook also serves as a way to enhance data transparency in the market, making OPEC’s analysis of market conditions available to all stakeholders – as well as our understanding of the complexities of the oil industry, both in the upstream and the downstream.

​Ladies and gentlemen,

​We have seen how important such work is during our recent deliberations.

​Throughout the long process leading to the Vienna Agreement, dialogue, close consultations and transparency between all energy stakeholders has been of paramount importance. And our constructive efforts to date have demonstrated that compromise and flexibility can lead to concrete achievements.

​I’d like to conclude by saying that it is our duty to always seek ways to overcome differences, exchange views, and find the unified voice that the oil industry and the global economy need.

​I am optimistic that continuing with such efforts can lead to greater stability and sustainability in the market.

​But since it is a truth of life that we should take nothing for granted, we must continue to work together – OPEC and non-OPEC, as well as producers and consumers. We all have something to gain by working together – and much to lose if we do not.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/183-12-december-2016.html"
"2016-12-10","​Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,
​Good morning,

​I would like to begin by welcoming all of you to the OPEC Secretariat for this OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting. The recent more structured dialogue between OPEC and non-OPEC producers was initiated following OPEC’s decision taken at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algeria on 28th September 2016, referred to as the ‘Algiers Accord’.

​We are very pleased to see so many Ministers and Heads of Delegation from non-OPEC producers present as we look to build on the ‘Vienna Agreement’, the result of the ‘Algiers Accord’. We value your contributions, your readiness to be part of this process and your attendance today for such an important meeting. It is a meeting that is vital for all producers, the oil industry, and the global economy as well.

​We would like to offer a specific thank you to my co-Chair for this meeting, His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation. He has been a strong advocate of the consultations that have taken place between OPEC and non-OPEC producers in order to restore the much sought-after balance to oil markets. His dedication and leadership in this process has been acclaimed by all.

​The ‘Algiers Accord’ set up a High-level Committee that was tasked with recommending the implementation of new production levels for OPEC Member Countries, as well as developing a framework of high-level consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries.

​From the OPEC and non-OPEC perspective, this set in motion a series of extensive bilateral and multilateral consultations, across countries and continents, and between OPEC and non-OPEC, as well as Heads of State and governments. We have seen commitment to this market rebalancing process from the very highest levels of our sovereigns.

​The last time OPEC and non-OPEC producers met here at the OPEC Secretariat was for a technical meeting of the High-level Committee on 29th October 2016; the meeting discussed oil market fundamentals, specifically issues related to market over-supply, demand, the stock overhang and the sharp contraction in industry investments.

​It also recommended to strengthen cooperation through regular, structured and sustainable consultations among OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

​What the past two months have shown is that there is a growing consensus among producers that the market recovery process has taken far too long, with severe consequences for both producer and consumer countries. It has had a major impact on all our countries, in terms of economic growth, heavy losses in revenue and deep social spending cuts.

​Moreover, it has also had adverse impact on consumers. We only have to look at the damaging levels of deflation in some OECD countries, as well as the record low interest rates, sometimes in negative territory in real terms, which is partly attributed to lower oil prices.

​It is thus vital we look to return sustainable stability to the market, in order to accelerate the ongoing drawdown of the stock overhang, bring the market rebalancing forward and ensure that the necessary future oil industry investments take place, in a timely fashion.

​These challenges were firmly in focus when OPEC Ministers met on 30th November for the 171st Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Vienna. This historic meeting delivered the ‘Vienna Agreement’, with the Conference deciding to adjust OPEC production by around 1.2 million barrels a day, to bring it to 32.5 million barrels a day, effective as of 1st January 2017.

​The decision was a collaborative timely action to address the prevailing market realities and prospects. And it was a commitment to the global community to help restore and sustain market stability with positive and broad implications on the world economy, the oil industry and oil producing and exporting nations.

​The efforts made by OPEC Member Countries were extremely constructive. They have shown great resolve, flexibility, responsibility, as well as a sense of compromise. The ‘Vienna Agreement’ is OPEC’s first production adjustment since the Oran meeting in Algeria in 2008, at the onset of the global financial crisis.

​The ‘Vienna Agreement’ has also been openly shared with the public to reflect its credible, equitable, transparent, measurable and verifiable features.

​We hope that today’s meeting will complete the picture from the non-OPEC perspective. We should aspire to announce to the world a responsible and timely joint action to help rebalance the market and see sustainable market stability return. I can only reemphasize the importance of this – for our countries, for the oil industry and for the global economy as a whole.

​In addition, we also believe it is vital to institutionalize a framework for cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries, to help better adapt and react to future industry cycles.

​We all recognise that the oil industry is cyclical by nature, but with regular, structured and sustainable interactions, both at the policy and technical levels, and through working together towards common goals, we can attempt to take the sharp edges off future cycles.

​Excellencies,
​Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen,

​I believe everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those historical moments in which we can together positively influence the future; for the benefit of our countries, and for the future stability of the oil industry, and the global economy at large.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/184-10-december-2016.html"
"2016-12-05","Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Chairman,

I am delighted to be here today – in the bustling city of New Delhi, in the dynamic and ever-growing country of India. As one of the world’s largest consumers of crude oil, India is of great importance to OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers alike.

Its vibrant economy currently enjoys the fastest growth in the world with a rate of 7.5% in 2016. At one level, India represents an important source of rapidly growing oil demand that appears to now be the highest, at nearly 300 tb/d − a rate that surpasses China. This expansion is being generated by the country’s transition to modern fuels in households, as well as rising demand in the transportation sector and in the petrochemical industry. This has provided a great incentive to the world’s oil producers, OPEC Member Countries in particular, to ensure that India’s future demand needs are met.

At another level, India is also home to one of the most important single consumers of crude oil, Reliance Petroleum, the world’s largest oil refinery. The new Jamnagar refinery has an annual processing capacity of about 1.2 million b/d. That is truly impressive.

There is, therefore, no doubt that India has emerged as a global player on the energy scene. And as a large oil consumer, India also shares with us and other global oil producers another important goal: oil market stability. The flip side of this is, of course, oil price volatility.

Hence, it is very timely indeed that I headed to this great country almost immediately after our OPEC Ministerial Conference on Wednesday, the 30th of November, to share recent developments in the oil market and provide OPEC’s perspectives, particularly in view of the OPEC Ministers’ landmark agreement, which, once again, demonstrated the Organization’s steadfast commitment to market stability in the interest of all producers and consumers of oil.

This also fits perfectly with the theme of this session and will hopefully provide food for thought and stimulate deliberation.

The oil markets in recent years, as we all witnessed with anxiety, have been characterized by a sustained drop in crude prices, accompanied by volatility.

The current downward cycle in prices, which is one of the longest in history, began its precipitous decline in June of 2014 and reached a low of $20/b in early 2016, a massive decline of 80%. This downward spiral has given oil prices increased visibility in recent years – both in the media, in major economic centers and in various industry fora. It is only recently that we have started to see encouraging signs of a reversing trend upwards.

However, if we refer to low prices and volatility, it is helpful to step back and recall our recent history. As they say, those who ignore the past are destined to repeat it.

Let us briefly recall the impact that the low oil price environment of the 1980s and 1990s had on producing countries – and the global oil industry in general.

During both cycles, low prices achieved only one thing: they dramatically choked off investments. Research and development spending was reduced. And drastic cost-cutting strategies were put into place across the board. Young people also lost any interest they might have had in making a career in the oil sector. And, in the long term, global supplies were put at risk.

This, of course, sounds strikingly similar to the conditions we have been seeing lately – with global investments falling, oil revenue decreasing and impacts on the global economy, including declining trade. In fact, global exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015, and a further 22 per cent drop is anticipated in 2016. Combined, this amounts to more than $300 billion, and this trend is expected to extend into its third year, which is unprecedented in the history of oil industry.

This is a stark contrast and challenge when we all know that, apart from the development aspirations and healthy economic growth of many producing countries, our capital intensive industry always requires huge investments for the production of new barrels, not only to meet growing demand but also to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. With the current state of the oil market, the industry will simply not be able to comply with the massive oil-related investment requirements that are estimated to be around $10 trillion in the period to 2040.

As in the previous downward cycles of the 1980s and 1990s, it has been necessary to find a way to expedite the long-delayed rebalancing of the market in order to restore stability. This current cycle’s recovery process has taken far too long, and the risk of delaying the adjustment any longer would be costlier and more complicated with a host of negative implications in the coming years.

Over the busy months of 2016 and after a show of unity and cohesion of the kind we just experienced last week in Vienna – OPEC countries were able to reach an agreement on the implementation of the Algiers Accord.

With efforts that were constructive, comprehensive and timely, OPEC’s Members were engaged in extensive bilateral and multilateral consultations over the past months that culminated in the Algiers Accord on 28 September 2016 and then finalized with a consensus decision of its implementation last week on 30 November 2016 in Vienna. The Vienna Agreement!

These were landmark decisions, and they included the participation of non-OPEC countries, who declared their resolve to join OPEC in achieving an accelerated realignment of global oil supply and demand. We will have our joint ministerial level meeting with non-OPEC countries this coming Saturday, the 10th of December, at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna – the first such meeting since 2002.

Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates, with an enormous sense of responsibility and humility; I want to declare that the world is on the verge of turning a historic page in global oil.

Let me briefly underscore some of the characteristics of this historic achievement and the outcome of the 171st Meeting of the Conference:

Overall, it was a collaborative action to address the prevailing market realities and, more importantly, a commitment to the global community in an effort to restore and sustain market stability with positive and broad implications on the world economy, on the oil industry and on the oil producing countries.

This is a message OPEC has always emphasized in its discussions with major stakeholders, including producers, consumers and the industry.

Throughout this process leading to the Vienna Agreement, constructive dialogue, along with flexible yet effective cooperation among OPEC producers have played a key role. This is the ongoing and evolving work that the OPEC Secretariat has tried to facilitate – and which I, as Secretary General, have been participating in and supporting since my arrival in Vienna on the 1st of August.

Let me stress that OPEC Member Countries maintain a steadfast commitment to ensuring the long-term supply of the market. Our Member Countries continue to invest heavily in both the upstream and the downstream, despite recent increases in costs and despite a continuing shortage of skilled labour across the industry.

I should like to add that the global macro conditions have continued to offer numerous other challenges as well. These have ranged from questions about global economic growth to environmental policies and political uncertainties in both oil consuming and producing countries. Such forms of uncertainty can be very costly for oil producers.

Looking forward to the medium and long term, however, we remain confident that demand for oil will continue to rise steadily in the foreseeable future. In fact, according to our recently published 10th edition of the World Oil Outlook 2016, global demand is forecast to increase by nearly 17 million b/d until 2040 – at which time it could reach around 110 million b/d.

In this, a pivotal role will be played by Asia, which is set to be the engine for future growth in world energy demand. In fact, emerging and developing economies in Asia are expected to make up roughly 70% of this growth – which is being spurred on by the region’s population growth, a rapidly expanding middle class, urbanization and industrialization.

India is projected to see its population grow by 317 million, surpassing that of China by 2030, and reaching 1.6 billion by 2040. This would correspond to around 18% of the world population, compared to 16% for China, during the same projection period in 2040.

GDP growth in India and China is especially noteworthy, with rates estimated at 6.9% per year and 4.9% per year, respectively, over the forecast period up to 2040.

In particular, China ($41.3 trillion) and India ($31.6 trillion) will together contribute more than half of the total global economic growth between 2015 and 2040.

India will also see dramatic increases in its real GDP over the next 25 years. It is anticipated to surpass OECD Europe in 2034 and, by 2040, India’s real GDP is estimated to be about the same size as OECD Americas.

Alone in India, oil demand is projected to rise to more than 10 mb/d by 2040 compared to 4.1 mb/d in 2015.

Such a substantial expansion in India and other fast growing economies in Asia will require supplies from all producing regions. Thankfully, OPEC Member Countries will play a crucial role in fuelling this dynamic growth. But for this to happen, continued investment in our Member Countries’ energy industries is required.

There is thus a clear need to ensure that prices are supported and stabilized. This is something that can only be achieved together, by sharing outlooks and through collaboration among the world’s producers, particularly as the world continues to evolve towards more inter-dependence and more tightly integrated energy markets. And it is exactly this spirit of cooperation that guided the actions of our Member Countries when they found firm and common ground during the Meeting of the Conference on the 30th of November in Vienna.

Such thinking also lies behind the establishment of active, formal and ongoing dialogues with the European Union, China and Russia, as well as with a number of other non-OPEC producers.

In fact, in December of 2015, OPEC held the first OPEC-India Energy Dialogue with the participation of India’s Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. This meeting was considered a milestone in setting such a dialogue in motion. While the discussions mainly focused on trade between OPEC Member Countries and India, and energy consumption in India, special importance was given to India’s crude oil demand and gas requirements. Roughly 85% of crude and 90% of gas going to India are sourced from OPEC Member Countries.

This dialogue was the first step in the development of what we hope will be a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership.

Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,

I am optimistic about all these laudable activities, as they could lead to more transparent security, stability and sustainability. But nothing can be taken for granted, and we must continue to work together: producers and consumers, OPEC and non-OPEC producers, and those working in the upstream as well as the downstream. We all have something to gain by working together – and much to lose if we do not.

I am sure you will agree that today’s complex energy markets require open communication and collaboration in order to ensure that the world’s future energy needs are met.

This 12th edition of Petrotech is one of the most important initiatives taken by this fine country of India to enhance and promote such open communication. And I am certain that through continual dialogue, collaboration and the exchange of information, we all stand to benefit − producers and consumers alike.

So, with that said, allow me to once again thank you for the opportunity to share with you our outlook and perspectives, and I wish you all a productive and successful time here at Petrotech.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/185-5-7-december-2016.html"
"2016-11-08","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It gives OPEC great pleasure to launch this year’s World Oil Outlook at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference. This is the first time we have unveiled the publication outside of the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna, and we are extremely pleased to be here in an OPEC Member Country, the United Arab Emirates, for the 2016 launch.

​This year’s World Oil Outlook is the tenth edition, a significant milestone for the publication. In the first edition back in 2007 it was emphasized that the Outlook was meant to contribute to the Organization’s commitment to support market stability and to provide a platform from which to review, analyze and evaluate various scenarios as to how the oil and energy scene may develop.

​This guiding principle has remained central to the Outlook over the past decade, as the publication has evolved and expanded its research and analysis. Today, the Outlook also has an online interactive version, first launched in 2015, that enables users to download specific data and information that lies behind the analysis and commentary.

​I should also like to highlight that yesterday we released the first-ever Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB) Smart App, which is a joint development by IT experts from OPEC and the UAE Ministry of Energy. This app will make the ASB’s content of international oil and gas data available from any mobile device, at any time, on any day, from anywhere.

​These recent developments are prime examples of OPEC’s support for data sharing and transparency.

​Turning to the World Oil Outlook 2016, the publication underlines the increasingly complex nature of the oil industry, both in the upstream and downstream; the market adjustments that have been taking place since the price drop that began in mid-2014; the continued interdependence of all nations; how security of supply and security of demand are very much interlinked; and the need to better understand the market drivers, challenges, uncertainties, as well as opportunities, we face. These include such issues as policies, technology developments, the shifting energy mix, energy poverty and sustainable development concerns.

​Allow me here to provide you with a number of key takeaways from this year’s publication, before our research team at the OPEC Secretariat present you with some more in-depth commentary.

​Since the publication of the 2015 edition in December last year, the oil market has shown some signs that fundamentals are rebalancing. However, high inventory levels continue to be a major concern.

​The need to accelerate the drawdown of the stock overhang and bring the market rebalancing forward were at the heart of the landmark 'Algiers Accord' taken by OPEC at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference at the end of September.

​Let me stress that OPEC Member Countries remain fully committed to implementing the 'Algiers Accord'. Our consultations will continue in the coming weeks, and this includes with non-OPEC nations. It is essential that all producers, both OPEC and non-OPEC, take coordinated action to help return sustainable stability to the market.

​This is not only vital for the short-term, but the long-term too, as our industry looks to fund investment in new exploration and production, arrest decline rates in existing fields, expand midstream and downstream capacity, and hire, train and support the people that will continue to drive this industry forward in the years ahead.

​The impact of the current industry cycle on investments has been unmistakeable in both 2015 and 2016. While global spending on exploration and production by oil and gas producers is expected to fall slightly less this year, when compared to 2015, the combined amount over the two years equates to a loss of more than $300 billion. Looking ahead, this will likely impact not only new projects coming onstream, but new discoveries too.

​Here, I should like to stress the continued commitment of OPEC Member Countries to invest in existing and new production capacity so as to ensure they meet the future requirements of consumers in a timely and sustainable manner.

​From the perspective of the future energy mix, renewables will continue to see the fastest growth, albeit from a low base. Fossil fuels are expected to see their share in the energy mix fall from 81 per cent to 77 per cent by 2040. Nonetheless, oil and gas combined are still anticipated to account for 53 per cent of the energy needs in 2040, similar to current levels. It is clear that oil will continue to be a fuel of choice for many years to come.

​Oil demand is estimated to reach over 109 million barrels of oil a day by 2040, a healthy increase of over 16 million barrels a day. The main driver of this growth is the road transportation sector in developing countries.

​On the supply side, non-OPEC sees a recovery in the medium-term, but then plateaus, before declining post-2030. It means that in the long-term it is OPEC that will be required to meet much of the expected additional demand. The estimated share of OPEC crude in the total world liquids supply in 2040 is 37 per cent, which is three percentage points higher than the 2015 level.

​Turning briefly to the downstream, key points include the expectation for new refining capacity to follow future oil demand growth to developing regions. And for the crude trade flows between the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific to make up almost 50 per cent of global oil trade movements by 2040.

​This year’s Outlook also devotes a specific chapter to the Paris Climate Agreement from last year’s COP 21 meeting, which entered into force on November the 4th. I should like to congratulate the UAE as one of the countries that has already ratified it.

​From the perspective of OPEC, we welcome this agreement. Our Member Countries played a role in drafting the agreement, and they will also play a role in its implementation, based on the convention principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ and respective capabilities.

​However, I should like to make reference to the fact that the Paris Agreement has reduced Annex 1 nations to voluntary contributions, and somewhat blurred the previous distinct classification between developed and developing countries.

​In this regard, it is important to note that the Paris Agreement also calls for 'equity' for all Parties. Each country should be allowed to develop in a sustainable manner, with a focus on the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities'. It is critical to ensure that less-developed countries and future generations have equitable access to development opportunities.

​The Outlook provides some analysis of the intended policy measures related to the Paris Agreement, underlines the uncertainties around its implementation and highlights its possible impact on the energy mix through a number of scenarios.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The World Oil Outlook is not about making predictions. We believe that the Outlook should be viewed as a tool of reference to stimulate discussion and debate among industry stakeholders, which we hope will lead to a better understanding of the future of the industry. It is clear that the sharing of viewpoints is critical to our industry’s future, not only in the short-term, but in the medium- and long-term too.

​We believe that this publication evidently demonstrates this – it is not only the result of close collaboration and coordination between the Secretariat and our Member Countries, but also a sign of OPEC’s ongoing commitment to dialogue as a means to help secure a sound and stable oil industry.

​In closing, I would like to offer some thanks.

​Thank you to the Government of the UAE, its Energy Ministry, as well as the organizers of ADIPEC, who have provided us with the platform to launch the World Oil Outlook 2016.

​Thank you to the many dedicated and professional staff at the OPEC Secretariat that have worked on the Outlook. The fruits of their labour can undoubtedly be seen here in the publication we are launching today. And, of course, in the joint venture Annual Statistical Bulletin (ASB) Smart App, in conjunction with the UAE Ministry of Energy.

​And a thank you to everyone here that is in attendance. We appreciate you listening, and we welcome the anticipated robust questions, as well as the expected constructive critique of the WOO that I am sure will stimulate our discussions.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/187-8-november-2016.html"
"2016-11-07","​Mr. President, distinguished delegates:

​I join all parties and previous speakers before me in congratulating you on your well-deserved election to preside over this important COP.

​In similar vein I also wish to congratulate our newly appointed Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, Patricia Espinosa, a veteran Diplomat and climate change negotiator.

​COP22 is significant not only because it coincides with the coming into force of the Paris Climate Agreement, but also holding at a time of uncertainties.

​Negotiations between the Parties have come a long way – leading to this historic moment. Thirteen out of fourteen OPEC Member Countries have signed the Agreement, and five have indeed already ratified it.

​OPEC and its Member Countries have been active partners in climate change negotiations and welcome the early enforcement of the Paris Agreement.

​Our Member Countries joined the global consensus in Paris in order to midwife this Agreement and move the process forward. However, we remain concerned on the weakening of some key principles of the Convention. The Principle of Equity; principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities; the convention provision of response measures on developing countries; are just some of these issues that COP22 should revisit and strengthened.

​Mr. President, distinguished delegates:

​We hope that the same cooperative and positive spirit that led us to its successful adoption at COP21 will be maintained in its implementation stage.

​In addition, we should also remind ourselves that the Agreement is under the Convention and should continue to be guided by its principles and provisions. In particular, the unique situation of developing countries should be given the top priority it deserves.

​OPEC remains committed to this process and will continue to support its successful and comprehensive implementation to ensure a ‘win-win’ outcome for all.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/186-7-18-november-2016.html"
"2016-11-07","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is an honour to deliver a keynote address at the opening of the 2016 Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference under the Patronage of His Highness, Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of The United Arab Emirates.

​It is also a pleasure to be on a panel of such high-level dignitaries – His Excellency, Dr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and CEO of ADNOC; His Excellency, Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, UAE Minister of Energy; and, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO, Exxon Mobil.

​I would like to thank everyone involved – the Government of the UAE, its Energy Ministry and ‘dmg events’ – for the invitation, all the excellent arrangements, as well as the hospitality we have received since arriving.

​With a 31-year history, ADIPEC is today one of the premier global energy industry conferences and exhibitions, attracting more than 100,000 oil and gas industry professionals from 120 countries around the world. It is a platform that allows industry stakeholders to come together to discuss viewpoints, share analysis, network, showcase technologically innovative solutions and provide a platform for bilateral trade. At OPEC, we are extremely proud to see such an event taking place in a Member Country.

​The importance of such an event cannot be over-estimated. The oil and gas industry is one of the most vital global economic sectors, and it will continue to be in the years to come. These products will remain vital in continuing to provide heat, light and mobility to billions. We also need to remember that there remain billions of others that still have no access to modern energy services. It is critical that this is rectified, and oil and gas can play a vital role in this regard.

​In talking about sustainable development, I feel I should also make reference to the ratification of the Paris Agreement only a few days ago. OPEC welcomes this agreement, and as I am here in the UAE I should like to highlight the fact that the UAE has already ratified it.

​However, we should not forget that the Paris Agreement calls for 'equity' for all Parties. Each country should be allowed to develop in a sustainable manner. Therefore, it is vital to ensure that less-developed countries have equitable access to development opportunities.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​The importance of oil and gas to our future is underscored in OPEC’s 2016 World Oil Outlook, which will be launched tomorrow at ADIPEC. This includes an online interactive version that enables users to download specific data and information that lies behind the analysis and commentary.

​Later this morning we will also officially launch the first-ever Annual Statistical Bulletin Smart App, which is a joint development by IT experts from OPEC and the UAE Ministry of Energy. This app will make the ASB’s content of international oil and gas data available instantaneously from any mobile device. This is another prime example of OPEC’s support for data sharing and transparency.

​Looking to the future, the 2016 World Oil Outlook sees global oil demand increasing from around 93 million barrels a day in 2015 to over 109 million barrels a day by 2040. And from the perspective of natural gas, demand increases from close to 350 billion standard cubic feet a day in 2015 to 590 billion standard cubic feet a day in 2040.

​In fact, oil and gas are still expected to contribute 53 per cent to the global energy mix by 2040.

​Of course, all this will require huge investments with new barrels needed to not only increase production, but also to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. Estimated oil-related investment requirements are close to $10 trillion in the period to 2040. And from the perspective of gas, the number is around $6 trillion.

​Let me stress here that OPEC Members are committed to invest in existing and new production capacity. They remain unswerving in their commitment to meeting the future requirements of consumers in a timely and sustainable manner.

​At the global level, however, the situation that has evolved over the past two years or so is putting this future at risk given the dramatic drop off in investments. Global oil and gas exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015 and a further 22 per cent drop is anticipated this year. Combined, this equates to above $300 billion.

​If market and financial conditions do not improve, there is the distinct possibility that we could see a third year of investment cutbacks. To put this into some oil industry context, there has never been a consecutive three-year decline in its history.

​This is a major concern for an industry that needs regular and predictable investments to provide the necessary supply in the medium- and longer terms.

​It is why we at OPEC have been undertaking intensive consultations over the past few months about how best to return stability to the market.

​From the perspective of OPEC, this led to the landmark ‘Algiers Accord’ at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference at the end of September. The agreement underlined the Organization’s continued commitment to a ‘sustainable stability’ in oil markets and was focused on accelerating the ongoing drawdown of the stock overhang and bringing the market rebalancing forward.

​The ‘Algiers Accord’ also highlighted the importance of developing a framework of high-level consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries.

​This led to the formation of a High-Level Committee that convened in Vienna at the end of October, with a meeting between OPEC Members, and then a meeting between both OPEC and some non-OPEC nations. These discussions were positive and have allowed us to better understand the viewpoints of all the various parties present.

​Consultations among OPEC, as well as non-OPEC, will continue in the coming weeks, with another High-Level Committee meeting set for later this month. We believe it is vital that OPEC and non-OPEC come together and take coordinated and timely action to rebalance the market, for the common good of all. Our industry works best with collaboration, cooperation and consensus.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​As this event highlights, there are many reasons why we should be optimistic about the industry’s future. It is clear that oil and gas will continue to be fuels of choice. And I have no doubt that through innovation, human ingenuity and technology, the industry will be able to continually transform itself to overcome the challenges it faces, and unlock the many opportunities before it in the years ahead.

​Of course, the current oil market is a challenging environment. However, as I have been witness to over the past couple of months, and I am sure will be readily apparent here at ADIPEC, the best way forward is for all industry stakeholders to continually dialogue and work towards achieving more stability for our industry.

​This is not only in the short-term, but in the long-term as well. This will help us deliver a sustainable energy future; for all producers and for all consumers too.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/188-7-november-2016.html"
"2016-10-29","​Excellencies,
​Distinguished delegates,
​Ladies and Gentlemen,

​I would like to welcome all of you to the OPEC Secretariat. Some of you are here for the first time.

​I am especially pleased to see the high-level presence of His Excellency, Natig Aliyev, Azerbaijan Minister of Industry and Energy. We are honoured to have you at this meeting.

​You join OPEC and its Member Country representatives for an important meeting – and what I hope will be a fruitful day of deliberations.

​This meeting is the result of the decision reached at the 170th Extraordinary Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algeria last month.

​That agreement – now known as the Algiers Accord – set a production target for OPEC’s 14 Member Countries, ranging between 32.5 and 33 mb/d in order to accelerate the ongoing drawdown of the stock overhang and bring the rebalancing process forward.

​The Algiers Accord was truly a landmark achievement. It was a collective decision reached by consensus of all the OPEC-14 Member Countries. It hindered a further slide in crude oil prices – which have since reversed direction – and also reduced volatility. These were certainly positive and encouraging.

​However, the markets are still under pressure of oversupply as reflected in excess stocks. The recovery process has taken far too long and we cannot risk delaying the adjustment any further.

​The Algiers Accord enabled a common platform for an effective action for us all and it should be implemented in a timely fashion. Anything short of implementation of this Accord could lead to the elongation of the rebalancing process with further deterioration of financial conditions and setbacks in investments extending into a third year, which would be unprecedented. 

​Therefore, we should be calling for maximum commitment from all OPEC and non-OPEC countries in this regard and we should expect no less as this is our commitment, not only to our Member Countries but to the global community.

​Today’s meeting, therefore, comes at a critical time for the global oil market as we producers jointly put efforts into taking action for the sake of the ‘sustainable market stability’ we all desire.

​The Algiers Accord also mandated several other important things.

​First, it established this High-level Committee, which was mandated to work towards the implementation of production levels among our Member Countries.

​This Committee, which brings together both OPEC and non-OPEC producers, is now tasked with engaging in deliberations that we hope will lead to coordinated and timely action in response to such challenges – for the benefit of the global economy and the common good of all.

​Second, the Algiers Accord also mandated this Committee to develop a framework of high-level consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries – a mechanism to facilitate long-term dialogue between us.

​This is meant to be a process through which we may together identify risks and take pro-active measures to ensure a balanced oil market on a sustainable basis.

​Over the past couple of months we have been part of many consultations and discussions – both with fellow OPEC countries and non-OPEC countries as well – about how best to return stability to the market.

​Let me state that our talks with non-OPEC countries – in which the Russian Federation has played an extremely active role – have been very constructive.

​I recall the optimistic nature and conduct of our talks on the side-lines of the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, around two weeks ago.

​We also had very positive consultations just this week during our High-level OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue on Monday. 

​Such close interactions are indeed very supportive – and are exemplary for the cooperation and joint actions we clearly seek among producers.

​I would also like to recognize the important leadership role already played by some non-OPEC countries. The statements of some national leaders – of countries such as Oman and Russia, for example – have demonstrated their support for this meeting, and reflect a broad understanding of the importance of sharing contributions among non-OPEC countries.

​I was very much encouraged by the statement made by Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation at the World Energy Congress on October the 10th in Istanbul. He stated that “Russia is ready to join joint measures on reducing the production of oil and invites other oil exporters to do so”. 

​Such support is important at critical times like these. It gives testimony to what some might think is only a narrow concern of a few countries. And it exemplifies the readiness of non-OPEC producers to enhance the rebalancing process.

​If we can remember that it is only together – not individually – that we can move forward, then I remain hopeful that the outcome of today’s meeting will be positive. 

​This calls for joint, coordinated and timely actions. And we hope to discuss how to implement such actions across both OPEC and non-OPEC producers.

​These talks are vital to better understand each other, our current circumstances, and what options are available to us to help reduce the imbalance and increase the stability of the market. We believe that by finding common ground among all producers, we will be able to develop lasting and sustainable solutions to the challenges we all face today.

​I wish to thank you for your attention – and I wish you all fruitful deliberations.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/189-29-october-2016.html"
"2016-10-28","​Distinguished delegates,
​Ladies and gentlemen,

​I would like to welcome you all to the most important gathering since the last Meeting of the Conference held in Algeria. That meeting, of course, produced the Algiers Accord, which has brought us here today. Today’s meeting is a continuation of that landmark decision.

​We are certainly living in challenging times – a time when many of the old ‘certainties’ have fallen away and a new landscape has opened up before us.

​However, it is a landscape so populated with changing variables that no single nation, company or enterprise can realistically be expected to respond alone.

​In fact, the challenges in the current market environment have highlighted the importance of OPEC’s role – not only for its Member Countries, acting as one, but also for the benefit of the global economy.

​These challenges have also underscored the need to forge ahead together – in ways that honour the relationships among our Member Countries.

​This is our duty. It is our mission.

​With this in mind, we meet to develop a framework for the implementation of the Algiers Accord.

​Our deliberations today – and tomorrow with some non-OPEC producers – could very well have fundamental ramifications for the market, as well as for the medium- to long-term of the industry.

​You will recall that the 170th Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference opted for an OPEC-14 production target ranging between 32.5 and 33 mb/d in order to accelerate the ongoing drawdown of the stock overhang and bring the rebalancing process forward.

​This was decided in order to restore much-needed stability to the market on a sustainable basis.

​Already this decision has reversed the market trend positively and reduced relative volatility.

​In establishing this Committee, the mandate of the Algiers Accord was, among others, to also develop production levels among our Member Countries within the agreed target range.

​It also mandated that the Committee develop a framework of high-level consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries.

​Since the Algiers Accord, a ‘road map for implementation’ has already begun to take shape. This has emerged in the process of carrying out extensive consultations with other stakeholders on how best to honour and implement the Conference’s decision – in the interest of all producers and consumers.

​Thus, OPEC has sought to use every occasion in recent weeks to advance the Accord. It has used additional platforms to confer with other producers.

​Similarly, OPEC has used other fora – like the G-24 Ministerial and the IMF/World Bank meetings in Washington, as well as the World Energy Congress in Istanbul – for extensive exchanges of perspectives on the current challenges facing not only the oil and gas industry but the global economy in general.

​The market has been out of balance for too long, due primarily to supply driven forces. These have led to a severe correction in prices, impacting required and timely investments, which is now threatening future supply.

​OPEC and non-OPEC must now come together and take coordinated and timely action for the common good of all.

​While we have seen the rebalancing process already underway, the physical market remains in surplus. A large stock overhang continues to persist. And today’s excess stocks of around 300 million barrels calls for our collective and urgent action.

​The recent High-level OPEC-Russia Dialogue Meeting this Monday was a good reflection of the broader consultations with other producers that we continue to undertake in response.

​Personally, I also just visited Baghdad, Iraq – the birthplace of our Organization and a key Founder Member – in order to solidify the consensus of the Algiers Accord.

​I also plan to visit other Member Countries in due course. But our task for today is clear.

​Our meeting today will include presentations given by the Secretariat – and, hopefully, other Member Countries – in order to provide you with the most current industry data and analysis.

​We expect that this will facilitate and enrich your deliberations.

​Finally, in accordance with the mandate of the Algiers Accord, we are also expected to develop a long-term framework for regular, structured and sustainable consultation with non-OPEC producers. Our meeting with some of them will take place tomorrow.

​Thank you for your attention. I will now yield the floor to the Chairman of the Board.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/190-28-october-2016.html"
"2016-10-24","​Excellencies,
​Distinguished delegates of the Russian Federation,
​Ladies and gentlemen,

​It gives me great pleasure to welcome His Excellency Alexander Novak, Minister of Energy of the Russian Federation, and his accompanying delegation to the OPEC Secretariat for this fifth High-level Meeting of the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue.

​Your Excellency, we appreciate your continued support of this dialogue. We believe our annual meetings are vital to improving our understanding of each other, through our sharing of viewpoints and outlooks. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your valuable input to the recent consultations that have been held between OPEC and non-OPEC countries, most recently in Istanbul and only yesterday in Riyadh, as we look to put in place the building blocks that would bring the oil market rebalancing forward. Your leadership role is not only evident, but widely acknowledged and appreciated.

​We are also very honoured to have present here today His Excellency Dr. Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada, Minister of Energy and Industry of the State of Qatar, and President of the OPEC Conference. His Excellency’s support of the work of the OPEC Secretariat over the past year has been exemplary and we very much look forward to his continued leadership in the journey ahead.

​At this juncture, I would like to take the opportunity to briefly review the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue over the years, and put into some perspective our achievements to date.

​OPEC’s relationship with the Russian Federation was initially shaped in the early 1990s. In 1992, Russia was given observer status to the OPEC Conference, and in subsequent years it participated in many OPEC Ministerial Conferences. Moreover, during this period there were also technical exchanges and workshops organized and attended by both sides.

​The OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue was then itself formalized in 2005. This evolved through OPEC’s participation and input to the preparatory process for Russia’s assumption of the G8 Presidency in 2006. This proved to be a good example of our expanding cooperation.

​I remember myself, on the occasion of addressing the International Energy Week in Moscow in October 2006, I met with His Excellency Viktor Khristenko, then Minister of Industry & Energy of the Russian Federation. In our talks we both restated the importance of strengthening the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue, particularly on issues related to the producers’ perspective, such as furthering cooperation in the G8 process and market management in view of the risk of market imbalances.

​In 2012, the two Parties brought a more structured framework to the dialogue by initiating annual High-level meetings. Today, is the fifth Meeting of our dialogue and I have no doubt it will build on the successful High-level meetings we have seen in recent years.

​The first of these was held at the OPEC Secretariat in September 2012. This meeting focused on the current state of the world oil market and more long-term perspectives, the oil and gas sectors in the Russian Federation, as well as global environmental and world trade matters.

​The Meeting concluded with both Parties underlining their commitment to furthering cooperation, not only at the high-level, but also at a technical level to facilitate more regular information exchange and analysis sharing.

​The second High-level Meeting took place in Moscow in October 2013, with both Parties focused on sharing their views on long-term oil market developments. The Meeting also agreed on the creation of two committees to research tight oil & shale gas development and global refinery developments.

​This High-level Meeting was also supported by the first technical meeting of the dialogue, following agreement at the first High-level Meeting to expand the dialogue at the technical level. The technical meeting saw presentations covering short- to long-term oil market analyses, the prospects for shale oil and gas, as well as discussions on topics such as the global economy, energy efficiency, renewables and changing trade patterns.

​This was followed by a second technical meeting that was held in Vienna at the end of March 2014, which focused on the research agreed at the last High-level Meeting, namely tight crude and unconventional NGLs and shale gas developments and global refinery developments.

​The third High-Level Meeting was then held in September 2014 in Vienna. The Meeting summarized the discussions from the last technical meeting and both Parties expressed their support for these technical interactions to allow for a better understanding of viewpoints, underlying assumptions and developments. The Meeting also outlined themes for the dialogue in 2015, namely the global petrochemical industry outlook and fiscal regime perspectives in the Russian oil sector.

​Our most recent Meeting took place in July 2015 in Moscow, where we shared our thoughts on short- and long-term market outlooks, as well as analysis on the two themes agreed upon at the previous meeting. Given the volatile oil market environment at the time of the Meeting, both Parties also stressed that price volatility and the general oversupply were not conducive for market stability, a prerequisite for the continuity of timely and adequate investments.

​In fact, Your Excellency, you have been actively present in all of these High-level meetings, and in looking back over the history of our cooperation I was drawn to a comment you made about the importance of this dialogue in 2012. You stated that the “OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue is meant to help both sides to assess future trends in the oil sector, as well as make necessary decisions and to find joint solutions to concrete difficult situations on the world oil markets”. This is a timeless statement and further underscores the value of our ongoing dialogue and cooperation.

​What has been evident at all the meetings, both High-level and technical, since the current series of High-level meetings began in 2012, is the fact that both of us are committed to stable and predictable markets: for the continued health of the industry and investments, for the benefit of both producers and consumers, and for the well-being of the global economy on a sustainable basis.

​We can all appreciate that market stability and balanced fundamentals remain critical issues today. Thus, today’s fifth Meeting is very timely and I look forward to hearing all the viewpoints on current market developments, as well as long-term prospects.

​While there are signs that the rebalancing of the fundamentals is underway, with overall non-OPEC supply contracting this year and demand at healthy levels, the large stock overhang continues to be a major concern.

​In this regard, we have responded to the recent market conditions with intensive talks and relentless efforts to help bring forward the realignment in global oil supply and demand. This bore fruit at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algeria in September 2016, with the landmark ‘Algiers Accord’. The consensus decision among OPEC countries has been effective in arresting any further deterioration in prices and it has helped reduce volatility.

​In addition, it has also improved overall market sentiment and strengthened the case for burden sharing and broader cooperation. We believe it is essential that producers, both OPEC and non-OPEC, look to address the issue of the stock high inventories. This is now central to the return of a balanced market and to establish sustainability.

​The importance of this cannot be overemphasized. We need sustainable market stability to fund investment in new exploration and production, to arrest decline rates in existing fields, to expand midstream and downstream capacity and to hire, train and support the people that will continue to drive this industry forward in the years ahead.

​Of course, there are also many other ongoing and related challenges for oil markets, such as: the uncertain prospects for the global economy; excessive speculation and the role of financial markets; the impact of geopolitics; advances in technology and the benefits that could spill-over into other areas of the energy value chain; environmental and climate change policies; and sustainable development concerns.

​A number of these issues are on our agenda today, with specific presentations on the uncertainties associated with climate policies, and technological developments and their possible implications for oil and energy markets.

​Excellencies, distinguished delegates,

​It is evident that the short-term picture is the one on all of our minds. But we need to appreciate the fact that all timeframes are interlinked. What happens today will have a bearing on what happens in the future, particularly given that this industry is very much a medium- to long-term business.

​In this regard, the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue has become an established platform, among others, to discuss the variety of challenges that we face, as well as the opportunities that our industry continues to offer. Over the years, our bilateral cooperation has flourished, and we value the direct and open channels of communication that have evolved. The leadership role of the Russian Federation is crucial in combatting the current energy challenges that are often intertwined and complex in nature.

​In closing, allow me to say that I very much look forward to today’s deliberations. I am sure that this meeting will be enriched and informed by the insights and experiences of everyone here as we look to further build this dialogue, and explore ways and means to work collectively to bring about the sustainable market stability we all desire.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/191-24-october-2016.html"
"2016-10-06","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a pleasure to be here in Washington D.C to address this G-24 Ministerial Meeting, of which OPEC is represented by five of its Member Countries: Algeria, Gabon, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela. Moreover, four other OPEC Members have observer status: Ecuador, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Given that the G-24 coordinates the position of developing countries on monetary and development issues, I feel that it is appropriate to provide you with some background and context to the decision taken by the OPEC Conference in Algiers last week. This is particularly apt given that some of your deliberations today have focused on the impact of lower oil prices on developing economies and commodity exporters, as well as on consuming nations, and the need for more stable markets and less volatile price swings.

The landmark decision taken at the 170th (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Algiers came after many rounds of consultative meetings and intensive talks. It underlines the Organization’s continued commitment to a ‘sustainable stability’ in oil markets, for the mutual interests of producing nations, for efficient and secure supplies to consumers, and with a fair return on invested capital for all producers.

The Conference decision to opt for an OPEC-14 production target ranging between 32.5 and 33 million barrels a day was focused on the need to accelerate the ongoing drawdown of the stock overhang and bring the rebalancing forward. These are vital for market stability.

And we should not forget the importance of lessening volatility and sustaining stability for the medium- and long-term given the world’s desire for more oil. However, the situation that has evolved over the past two years or so is putting the future at risk. We are currently witnessing a dramatic drop off in oil market investments. For example, global exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015 and a further 22 per cent drop is anticipated this year. Combined, this equates to above $300 billion.

We believe the agreement made in Algiers will be beneficial to our economies, to consumers, to the global oil market, and the world economy as a whole.

Let me stress that last week’s decision was also taken following a thorough review and analysis of the global economic outlook, specifically the weaker than desired global growth and the economic uncertainties.

This includes the already mentioned sharp decline in oil investments, which has had a considerable negative impact on the energy sector of many major economies, the role of main central banks on monetary policies, weakening world trade, and political developments, including upcoming elections in a number of major countries.

At OPEC, we fully appreciate the significant role that oil and other commodity markets play in the global economic landscape, and the expanding share of global GDP attributed to emerging economies and commodity exporting countries.

Stability in commodity markets is vital for future global economic growth prospects.

To conclude, OPEC’s agreement in Algiers will help return stability to the global oil market, and lessen volatility. Moreover, it is important to underline that things have progressed further over the past week.

Consultations remain ongoing among the OPEC-14, the High Level Committee initiated by the OPEC Conference is moving forward on the implementation of the Algiers decision, and steps are being taken to further develop a framework for high-level consultations between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries. We believe there is firm and common ground for continuous collaborative efforts among producers, both within and outside OPEC.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/192-6-october-2016.html"
"2016-09-28","​Excellencies,
​Bonjour. Masā' al-khayr. Good afternoon.

​It gives me great pleasure to see all the Heads of Delegation of OPEC Member Countries here today. This is the first time all OPEC Ministers have been together in Algeria since the landmark 151st Extraordinary Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Oran in December 2008.

​I would also like to personally offer a warm welcome to Gabon and its Head of Delegation, His Excellency Etienne Dieudonné Ngoubou, his country’s Minister of Petroleum and Hydrocarbons. This is the first time Gabon has been part of a meeting of OPEC Ministers since the country officially rejoined OPEC in July this year.

​Excellencies,

​It is an honour for us to host this consultative meeting, which follows the successful outcome of the 15th International Energy Forum (IEF) Ministerial meeting here in Algiers. The dialogue we have all been part of during the IEF meeting, bringing together both producers and consumers, has been extremely welcome as we all look to confront the challenges and opportunities facing the oil market today.

​There has been much talk of achieving ‘sustainable market stability’ and I have no doubt from my conversations with you that this is central to the thinking of all our Member Countries. The importance of this cannot be overstated.

​While the global oil market is showing signs of rebalancing, the process has taken longer than all of us expected. And our Member Countries have all suffered significantly since the oil price started falling back in the middle of 2014. We need to ask ourselves the question: can we wait for market forces to eventually rebalance the market and return the stability we all desire, with prices at levels that allow our Member Countries to grow their economies and invest in necessary new capacity?

​It is important to also stress that this meeting should not only be viewed as a short-term necessity. Yes, the short-term is in all of our minds, but as we all know, this is very much a medium- to long-term business. We need to view this meeting as vital to long-term oil market stability.

​I would like to personally thank you for the major efforts that have been made over the last few weeks or so to bring us all together and help build bridges towards a consensus. These intensive talks have been vital to better understand each other, our current circumstances, the challenges we all face, and what options are available to us to help stabilize the market.

​I feel we have taken great steps to shape a fair and common understanding among us all. We have all shown accommodation. We have all shown flexibility. And we have all shown that our Member Countries have a collective interest in maintaining OPEC as an effective, capable and credible organization.

​I believe it is vital for all of us here to leave this meeting with a positive and convincing message that we as petroleum and energy ministers are doing everything we can to help return stability to the global oil market.

​In addition, the platform of an OPEC consensus will be vital in our ongoing consultations with non-OPEC producers. If we can find common ground, then I am sure there is the opportunity to develop lasting and sustainable solutions among all producers.

​Excellencies,

​I hope today that we can take a further step and reach a consensus to pave the way for an agreement. This will be beneficial to our economies, the world economy as a whole, and the global oil market.

​We need to demonstrate to the oil industry and the world at large that we can act together and meet the genuine expectations of our Member Countries. Many of our governments have made recent statements urging OPEC to take a proactive approach, for a positive outcome.

​We, in Algeria, have done everything possible to make this meeting a success. I hope that when we leave this meeting we can show the waiting world that all of us here, our Member Countries, and OPEC, can deliver when it matters most.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/193-28-september-2016.html"
"2016-09-28","​Excellencies,
​Good afternoon.

​I would like to begin by thanking the Algerian Government and His Excellency Noureddine Boutarfa, Algeria’s Minister of Energy, for organizing today’s meeting and the Ministerial of the International Energy Forum. The facilities, the organization, the hospitality, have all been world class.

​I feel it is also appropriate to personally welcome His Excellency Noureddine Boutarfa who is attending a meeting of OPEC Ministers for the first time. Your Excellency, in the short period you have been Minister of Energy, you have certainly hit the ground running. Your prominent role in the shuttle diplomacy that has taken place over the last few weeks has been extremely welcome. You have made an enormous contribution in working to make this meeting a success.

​I had the privilege of hosting His Excellency Noureddine Boutarfa, as well as His Excellency Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC Secretary General, in Doha earlier this month. The meetings we had were extremely open and productive as we discussed the outlook for the oil market, and considered ways that oil producers might respond to the ongoing and future challenges facing the industry.

​As OPEC Conference President, I would also like to offer a warm welcome to His Excellency Etienne Dieudonné Ngoubou, Gabon’s Minister of Petroleum and Hydrocarbons, and His Excellency Jabbar Ali Hussein Al-Luiebi, Iraq’s Minister of Oil, who are attending a meeting of OPEC Ministers for the first time.

​Excellencies,

​I know everyone here has played an active role in the discussions leading up to this meeting. I would like to thank you all. The efforts to build a consensus have been exemplary, and I very much hope that the constructive, accommodating and encouraging nature of our recent talks carries on today.

​I cannot emphasize enough how important it is for us, our Member Countries, OPEC as an Organization, and the oil market, to leave this meeting with a plausible and convincing message. One that shows that OPEC fully understands the current market situation, and is making every effort to deliver the ‘sustainable market stability’ we all desire.

​In this regard, I feel it is important to recall that throughout OPEC’s history the Organization has faced numerous challenges. It has been able to overcome these through cooperation and compromise. Through my talks with you all, I feel that there is the same commitment to ensure that we find solutions to come through the current challenges we all face.

​Excellencies,

​The last time we all met together was at the OPEC Ministerial Conference in Vienna back in June this year.

​On 2nd June when we convened, the OPEC Reference Basket stood at just over $45 a barrel. In the period since it has gone both above and below this level. However, thus far in September it has been below $45 a barrel, and today stands in the low 40s. In the meantime, volatility and speculation have remained prevalent in the market.

​With regard to global economic growth, the story was somewhat inconsistent and changeable back in June and it remains so today. Our global growth estimate for 2016 has fallen from 3.1 per cent in June to 2.9 per cent today, although for 2017, this is expected to increase to 3.1 per cent.

​On the supply side, in June it was anticipated that non-OPEC supply would decline by 740,000 barrels a day in 2016. In the interim, the expected decline has lessened to a contraction of 600,000 barrels a day. Moreover, we also now anticipate non-OPEC supply to grow by 200,000 barrels a day in 2017, against a decline of 100,000 barrels a day when this estimate was first announced in July.

​For demand, there has been little change. It remains robust. Global demand is currently anticipated to expand by 1.2 million barrels a day this year, the same level as expected in June. We estimate a similar level of demand growth in 2017.

​And from the perspective of stocks, OECD and non-OECD inventories are still very high. In fact, OECD commercial oil stocks are currently little different to the numbers we saw presented in June, at around 340 million barrels above their five-year average.

​What this underscores is that there are many uncertainties and the pace of the market readjustment is taking longer than expected. Back in June, the prospects suggested that the market would rebalance by the end of this year or in the first half of 2017. However, there are now serious questions being asked regarding this timeframe, with many agencies and analysts pushing the rebalancing further into the future.

​Excellencies,

​The market has changed since June and our expectations about the rebalancing process have shifted. It is evident that there is now a greater degree of urgency about ensuring the market returns to balance as quickly as possible.

​The last few weeks have seen much talk about how this could be best achieved. I believe there is a common understanding that we need to look at market stabilization measures aimed at reducing the length of the downturn and lessening volatility.

​We just need to find an understanding on what measures we can take at this meeting to make it a success, and which will then hopefully lead to a future agreement.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/194-28-september-2016.html"
"2016-09-27","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Good morning.

It gives me great pleasure to be here in Algeria, an OPEC Member Country, for this 15th International Energy Forum Ministerial (IEF) meeting. I would like to thank the Algerian Government, its Energy Ministry, and the IEF for organizing this event, and for inviting me to speak in this opening session.

I would also like to take this opportunity to wish the new IEF Secretary General, Dr. Sun Xiansheng, who I met for the first time in Paris earlier this month, every success in his new position. Your Excellency, I believe we both took up our positions on 1st August 2016. So I am sure we will share many platforms together in the future. I look forward to this.

This morning we are also sitting alongside the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Dr. Fatih Birol. In my position as OPEC Secretary General I have already had the pleasure of personally meeting with Dr. Birol at the IEA’s headquarters in Paris. I am sure we will have a close working relationship and speak together at events on many occasions. I look forward to this too.

[SLIDE 2]
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

[SLIDE 3]
Since the last IEF Ministerial meeting in May 2014, the market has undergone much upheaval and witnessed significant volatility.

Between June 2014 and January 2016 the OPEC Reference Basket price fell by 80 percent. It is the largest percentage fall in the five episodes of sharp price declines we have observed over the past three decades. Although since the start of this year prices have mostly seen an upward trend, and the OPEC Reference Basket price now sits above $40 a barrel.

The current cycle was supply-driven with most of the supply increases in recent years coming from generally high-cost non-OPEC production. Between 2008 and 2015, non-OPEC liquids supply growth was 7.9 million barrels a day, while OPEC liquids production was 1.5 million barrels a day during the same period. A similar surge in non-OPEC supply also occurred during the short timeframe from 1977–1984 when non-OPEC supply grew by more than 11 million barrels a day.

[SLIDE 4]
The knock-on impacts of these developments have been felt across the industry.

For example, global exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015, and a further 22 per cent drop is anticipated this year. Combined, this equates to a loss of more than $300 billion. This will impact not only new projects coming on-stream, but new discoveries too.

And with supply outpacing demand, the market has seen a global oil inventory build since mid-2014. The difference to the five-year average in terms of total OECD commercial stocks remained very high at around 240 million barrels at the end of August. Moreover, since last year stocks in the non-OECD region, mainly going to strategic petroleum reserves, rose by around 150 million barrels to nearly 2,250 million barrels, encouraged by lower crude oil prices.

[SLIDE 5]
There is evidence to suggest that the market is now gradually realigning itself. In 2016, non-OPEC supply is expected to contract by 0.6 million barrels a day and oil demand growth is set to be 1.2 million barrels a day.

However, a return to balance is taking time due to the persistently high stocks overhang.

[SLIDE 6]
We also need to appreciate how short-term developments and the current instability can impact the medium- and long-term.

Looking ahead, all energies will be required, and there is no doubt that oil will remain a fuel of choice. OPEC sees oil demand increasing by around 17 million barrels a day between now and 2040 to reach close to 110 million barrels a day.

This will require significant investments. New barrels are needed to not only increase production, but also to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. Overall, we see oil-related investment requirements of around $10 trillion over the period to 2040.

We need to ask ourselves: Is the current environment putting this future at risk? What is clear is that a prolonged period of low prices is not good for anyone. Low oil prices are a concern for producers today and lead to situations that are a concern for consumers tomorrow. And high oil prices are a concern for consumers today and lead to situations that are a concern for producers tomorrow.

To reverse the declines in investment and output, it is vital to see a rebalanced market with sustainable stability, so that the industry can deliver the necessary investments for our energy future.

In this regard, it is vital to keep in mind the link between the marginal cost, the price and investments.

[SLIDE 7]
Of course, there are also many other ongoing and related challenges for oil markets, such as: the uncertain prospects for the global economy; excessive speculation and the role of financial markets; the impact of geopolitics; advances in technology and their impacts on exploration and production; and environmental and sustainable development concerns.

I see that many of these issues are on the agenda for subsequent sessions. I look forward to listening to the speakers, and playing an active role in the discussions.

[SLIDE 8]
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Given that the oil industry is highly capital-intensive and with long-lead times for projects, stability is vital. That is not to say that we can rid the market of cycles altogether – these have been part of the modern oil industry since the first successful oil drilling by Edwin Drake in Pennsylvania in 1858. But we need to ensure that we all do everything we can to reduce the length of downturns, lessen any volatility, further enhance energy data transparency, through such platforms as the JODI, and continually make the industry more resilient and more efficient.

This means bringing together all industry stakeholders, to help develop cooperative and coordinated approaches to the often complex challenges, as well as the multitude of uncertainties, we all face in achieving market stability in the short-, medium- and long-terms.

Market stability and sustainable energy development go hand-in-hand with open dialogue and action-oriented cooperation to evolve inclusive solutions.

Let me stress that OPEC has been a reliable supplier of oil and a dependable partner in a broad community of stakeholders and will continue to be in the future. We are committed to delivering a sustainable oil and energy future for all.

[SLIDE 9]
Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/195-27-september-2016.html"
"2016-09-20","Ladies and gentlemen,
Buongiorno. Good morning to you all.

[SLIDE 2]
I would like to thank the organizers, The European House – Ambrosetti, one of the leading independent global think tanks, for inviting me to speak at today’s event. It is a pleasure to be here, and to share the floor with so many distinguished speakers.

Being here in Rome as OPEC Secretary General, and at an event organized in cooperation with Eni, causes me to recall how both OPEC and Eni were formed. There is some shared history.

[SLIDE 3]
Eni was the vision of Enrico Mattei who helped created the company back in the 1950s, and then in later years negotiated important oil contracts in the Middle East, as well as a significant trade agreement with the then Soviet Union. He wanted to form a strong Italian energy corporation, and break the then oil market dominance of a group of multinational oil companies labelled the ‘Seven Sisters’.

Around the same time, in 1960, OPEC was formed in Baghdad, Iraq, by five oil-producing developing countries around the premise of cooperation, with a commitment to safeguard their legitimate national interests and to ensure order and stability in the international oil market. The main catalyst for its birth being when the ‘Seven Sisters’, who effectively controlled the quantity of oil extracted and decided how much was sold, to whom, and at what price, unilaterally reduced the posted prices of the crude they supplied.

Back then, both Eni and OPEC helped set the context for the future of the international oil market. Their formations were pioneering acts.

Of course, both have come a long way since, evolving into strong, mature and established organizations. In fact, I believe Eni has been present in all OPEC Member Countries at some point in its history, and remains active in most of them today. Looking ahead, I have no doubt that both OPEC and Eni will continue to play an important role in our global energy future, which brings me to the main theme of today’s conference.

[SLIDE 4]
I have been asked to help set the context in terms of ‘the future of energy’. It is a topic that offers up much scope for speakers and I am sure we will hear a diversity of viewpoints today.

It is a future laden with challenges and uncertainties, but also opportunities. I could easily speak for a lot longer than the time we have allocated! There will no doubt be areas where we may all agree, as well as areas where there will be divergences. This is natural, and I look forward to interesting and lively discussions.

I think one thing we can all agree on is the fact that the world will need more energy in the decades to come. It is easy to appreciate why.

In the period to 2040, the global economy is estimated to more than double. And over the same timeframe, world population is projected to reach around 9 billion, an increase of over 1.7 billion from today’s level.

And we should not forget that today around 2.7 billion people still rely on biomass for their basic needs, and 1.3 billion have no access to electricity. It is vital this is addressed. There is huge potential for socio-economic development in terms of expanding access to modern energy services.

We expect global energy demand to increase by almost 50 per cent by 2040. Energy will be required to power more homes, more services, more businesses, more cars, more planes, more ships … I could go on.

At the same time, however, we need to recognize the threat posed by climate change to our environment. Let me stress here that OPEC welcomes last year’s COP 21 agreement in Paris. Our Member Countries played a role in drafting the agreement, and they will also play a role in helping implement it.

So while the world will need more energy, it also needs to use it more efficiently and continually look to develop, evolve and adopt cleaner energy technologies.

To put it simply, the basic energy challenge can be summed up in two questions.

The first is how can we ensure there is enough supply to meet expected future demand growth?

And the second is how can this growth be achieved in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment?

[SLIDE 5]
What is clear is that all forms of energy are required. A diverse mix of sources is the best way forward. However, it is vital we appreciate just what each energy source can provide in the decades ahead.

There is no doubt that renewables, such as solar and wind, will continue to significantly expand their role. OPEC Member Countries recognize and support the development of renewables. Many of our countries have great sources of solar and wind, and significant investments are being made in these fields.

Biomass, nuclear and hydropower are also expected to maintain their share in the global energy mix in the years ahead.

Overall, these renewable energies and nuclear are expected to increase their share in the energy mix from 18 per cent in 2015 to 22 per cent by 2040.

All of the three main primary sources of energy – oil, gas and coal – will still supply more than three-quarters of the energy mix by 2040. Oil will be at just over 25 per cent, with coal slightly less, and gas slightly more.

From the perspective of oil and gas, it underscores the fact that they will remain central to supplying the growing global population with the critical energy it needs in the decades ahead.

Of course, you may say to me, well you would say this – you are the OPEC Secretary General. But I am also a realist. I do not see any outlook predicting that renewables will come close to overtaking oil and gas in the decades ahead.

[SLIDE 6]
In the industrialized world, we need to remember how important oil and gas have been to our past. They have transformed our economies and our societies. They have provided heat, light and mobility. They have created and sustained economic growth and prosperity. The products derived from these precious natural resources are fundamental to our daily lives.

However, we should not forget that this has not been the story for everyone. When we start up our cars, switch on a light, turn on our mobile phones, we need to recognize that these everyday things are still unknown to billions of people across the world who continue to suffer from energy poverty.

These are people that need their voices heard. They need access to reliable, safe and secure modern energy services at scale.

Of course, the economics of wanting more, coupled with growing populations and rising energy demand, has created challenges that were not foreseen when Thomas Edison was developing the light bulb, or when Henry Ford was mass producing the car.

I am talking here about the environmental challenge. In this regard, we need to recognize that the issue is not oil and gas themselves. The problem is the emissions that come from burning them.

It is a challenge we need to face head on. And I believe it is a challenge that can be overcome. Given what I have already said, it would be wrong of us to dismiss oil and gas as part of the past. I am a believer that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions.

Here, the world has made progress, but much more work and collaboration is required. We need to continually look at the development and use of cleaner technologies, such as carbon capture and storage and many others in the future.

At OPEC, we recognize the importance of continually looking to advance the environmental credentials of oil, both in production and use. We welcome coordinated action with the industry and through various research and development platforms.

[SLIDE 7]
Given that I am speaking on behalf of OPEC, I feel I need to also talk specifically about the global oil market.

There is no doubt that oil will remain a fuel of choice for the foreseeable future. OPEC sees oil demand increasing by around 17 million barrels a day between now and 2040 to reach close to 110 million barrels a day.

To meet this expansion will require huge investments. We need to consider that new barrels are needed not only to increase production, but to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields. It is estimated that oil-related investment requirements are around $10 trillion in the period to 2040.

In thinking about this, it is vital to remember that the short-, medium- and long-term timeframes are all linked. What happens today can have a major bearing on the future. We need to ask ourselves whether the recent oil price environment is putting this future outlook at risk.

Over the past two years or so the industry has gone through some major readjustments and this had led to a significant drop off in investments. For example, global exploration and production spending fell by around 26 per cent in 2015, and a further 22 per cent drop is anticipated in 2016. Combined this amounts to around $300 billion.

Moreover, according to industry sources, in 2015 explorers discovered only about a tenth as much oil as they have annually on average since 1960. Just 2.7 billion barrels of new supply was discovered in 2015, the smallest amount since 1947.

This is a major concern for an industry that needs regular and predictable investments and output to provide the necessary supply in the medium- and longer terms. To reverse the declines, oil prices have to go up from recent levels.

[SLIDE 8]
We remain optimistic that the industry will emerge stronger from these tough times. We need to keep in mind that the story of our industry is one of many cycles, both up and down.

We have had periods when prices were low, and periods when prices were high. We have seen times when supply outstripped demand, and times when supply has struggled to keep up. There have been long periods of stability, as well as periods of instability.

But we need to remain vigilant, continually monitor the market and the global economy, and do everything we can do to make downward cycles shorter and less extreme. And of course, continue to make the industry ever more efficient in areas such as costs and technologies.

Today, the physical oil market remains in surplus, but it is evident that the rebalancing process is underway.

World economic growth is expected to be 2.9 per cent in 2016 and 3.1 per cent in 2017, although uncertainties such as the impact of the UK’s decision to leave the EU and the monetary policies of major central banks will need to be watched closely.

Global oil demand growth is expected to increase by around 1.2 million barrels a day in both 2016 and 2017. And non-OPEC oil supply is anticipated to contract by around 600,000 barrels a day this year, and then increase slightly by 200,000 barrels a day in 2017.

However, there remains a large stock overhang, and working this off is going to take some time.

Since the end of 2013, OECD commercial stocks have seen their five-year average move from a negative level of 85 million barrels to a surplus of around 340 million barrels today. For the same period there has also been a rise in non-OECD inventories, plus an expansion in some non-OECD strategic petroleum reserves.

These stock increases have been mainly driven by increasing non-OPEC liquids production, which grew by 3.8 million barrels a day in 2014 and 2015. OPEC liquids production grew by only 1.2 million barrels a day over the same period.

The OECD commercial stocks surplus against the five year-average has stabilized this year, but it is important that this starts to reduce. As we have seen in previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling on a regular basis then prices start to rise.

It is essential both OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as consumers, look to address the issue of the stock overhang. This is now central to the return of a balanced market.

[SLIDE 9]
I am sure this will be discussed during next week’s International Energy Forum (IEF) Ministerial Meeting in Algiers, with all OPEC Member Countries and many non-OPEC producers in attendance.

It is vital for all producers to sit around the table and discuss any possible action that may be required to stabilize the market. And this kind of cooperation needs to be done not only in times of instability, but also when the market is stable and balanced. Dialogue is vital at all times.

Of course, I cannot stand here and say dialogue will mean we find agreement on everything. We don’t live in a perfect world. But it is important for all stakeholders to find common ground, and look for shared solutions, where and when appropriate.

Over the years OPEC has pushed many forms of energy cooperation, including dialogues with the EU, Russia China and India, symposia and workshops with the IEF and the IEA, various initiatives with the G20, and meetings with other industry stakeholders.

[SLIDE 10]
Ladies and gentlemen,

Looking back to when OPEC and Eni were formed in the middle of last century, very few could have predicted how oil would change our societies for the better. And the backbone of this has been reliable and dependable suppliers, such as OPEC and Eni, which have delivered secure and steady supplies. I have no doubt this will continue in the future.

To conclude, I would like to recall an important and meaningful meeting organized by Eni in the early 1980s. It was held at the Palazzo Barberini and the meeting was called ‘Development through Cooperation’. With the same spirit and engagement, I want to underscore a similar vision and call for ‘stability and sustainability through active cooperation’.

To best achieve this, given the long-term nature of the industry, we need more clarity and predictability concerning the future - not only for oil, but energy in general. In this regard, I would like to leave you with one key word: 'stability’.

Stability for investments and output expansion to flourish;

Stability for economies around the world to grow;

Stability to provide access to modern energy services for those currently without;

And stability for producers that allows them a fair return from the exploitation of their exhaustible natural resources.

Stability is the key to a sustainable global energy future for us all.

"2016-04-21","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​I would like to thank the organizers of this event for inviting me to the 17th International Oil Summit. It is a pleasure to be here.

​I am sure everyone appreciates that the last two years have been a challenging time for the oil industry. At times it has felt as though the industry has been in constant flux, as investments, projects, margins and jobs have been cut.

​While the short-term focus remains on returning balance and stability to the market, something I will return to later, it is also vital that we do not lose sight of the medium- and longer term outlook. All timeframes are inter-linked; what happens in the short-term will have knock-on impacts for the industry’s prospects.

​This will be the focus of my remarks this morning, with a specific emphasis on some of the main topics of the conference’s overall theme – “restoring profitability”, “prices”, “the current environment” and “COP 21”. And how all this fits into what is central to the industry’s future – ensuring that the required investments are made.

​Before this, in order to set the scene, I feel it is important to provide some key pointers related to our energy and oil future.

​[SLIDE 2]
​First, the global economy is estimated to more than double in the period to 2040.

​Second, passenger car ownership rates are expected to increase from just over 1 billion today to close to 2.2 billion by 2040. The number of commercial vehicles on the road is also anticipated to more than double. And we will no doubt see more flights being taken.

​Third, with billions of people still having no access to electricity and many more still relying on biomass for their basic needs, there is huge potential for socio-economic development in terms of expanding access to modern energy services.

​Fourth, world population is projected to reach around 9 billion by 2040, an increase of over 1.7 billion from today’s level.

​And fifth, there is last year’s COP 21 agreement here in Paris to counter the threat posed by climate change, which all OPEC Member Countries were part of. Let me stress that OPEC welcomes this agreement.

​So looking ahead, the basic challenge is twofold:

​Given the points I have just outlined we expect global energy demand to increase by almost 50 per cent by 2040. So how can we ensure there is enough supply to meet demand?

​And, how can this growth be achieved in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment?

​[SLIDE 3]
​Of course, we will see further actions to improve energy efficiency across our economies. This is essential.

​From the perspective of what will make up the future energy mix, it is clear that all forms of energy are required. However, it is crucial we appreciate just what each energy source can provide in the decades ahead.

​There is no doubt that renewables, such as solar and wind, will continue to significantly expand their role. OPEC Member Countries recognize and support their development. Many investments are being made by Member Countries in this sector.

​Nuclear and hydropower will also maintain their share in the global energy mix in the years ahead.

​Overall, non-fossil fuel energy is expected to make up around 22 per cent of the global energy mix by 2040.

​It means that fossil fuels will still need to supply more than three-quarters of the energy mix by 2040.

​I realize that others may have slightly different numbers, but given current energy and technology expectations, I do not see any outlook predicting that non-fossil fuels will come close to overtaking fossil fuels in the decades ahead.

​[SLIDE 4]
​These viewpoints lead me into some of the key themes of the conference and their impact, or potential impact, on oil market investments.

​I will begin with COP 21. Given what I have just described, I find it hard to understand the view that fossil fuels may not be needed in the decades ahead.

​Fossil fuels remain abundant, and are necessary for our future. Just as they have been an essential part of our past. They have positively impacted the lives of billions over the centuries. They have provided heat, light and mobility. And they have been central to the development of the industrial civilization as we know it today.

​As an industry, we should be proud of these achievements. For oil, the products derived from this precious natural resource are fundamental to our daily lives. And they will be vital to many more billions of people in the years ahead.

​Yes, there are environmental issues regarding the emissions that come from fossil fuels. But I believe that this is a challenge that can be overcome. I am a believer that solutions can be found in technologies that reduce and ultimately eliminate these emissions.

​We need to look at the development and use of cleaner fossil fuel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage and many others in the future. At OPEC, we recognize the importance of continually looking to advance the environmental credentials of oil, both in production and use.

​[SLIDE 5]
​Turning now to the current oil market environment, I think we can all appreciate that we have witnessed some tough times for the industry over the past two years.

​The current cycle has been supply-driven, with much of the additional supply in recent years coming from high-cost non-OPEC production. In the three-year period between 2013 and 2015, non-OPEC supply increased by over 5 million barrels a day, while OPEC production actually saw a slight contraction.

​In looking at 2016, we do see a further rebalancing of supply and demand as we move through the year. And as with previous cycles, I have no doubt that the industry will come through this one. However, uncertainties remain. Here, I am specifically referencing stock levels.

​Since the end of 2013, OECD commercial stocks have seen their five-year average move from a negative level of 85 million barrels to a surplus of around 350 million barrels today. It should also be noted that more than three-quarters of this overhang is in North America. There is no doubt this has strongly impacted crude prices.

​For the same period there has also been a rise in non-OECD inventories, plus an expansion in some non-OECD strategic petroleum reserves.

​It is essential both OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as consumers, look to address the issue of the stock overhang. As we have seen in previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling then prices start to rise.

​Here, we need to remember that low oil prices are bad for producers today and lead to situations that are bad for consumers tomorrow. And high oil prices are bad for consumers today and lead to situations that are bad for producers tomorrow.

​[SLIDE 6]
​This all underlines the investment challenge facing the industry.

​To put it simply: for any industry, investors will only put money into projects if they see demand for their product and have expectations for a profitable outcome. This is natural.

​All investments require certain conditions. For example, in terms of security of demand, we need to recognize that this is just as important to producers as security of supply is to consumers. Its absence can lead to investment uncertainty, and, in turn, future market instability.

​Producers do not want to waste precious financial resources now on infrastructure that might not be needed in the future. At the same time, however, if timely and adequate investments are not made, then future consumer needs might not be met.

​Of course, in the current oil market environment we are already witnessing significant investment cuts due to low oil prices. For example, global exploration and production spending fell by around 20 per cent last year, and a further 15 per cent drop is anticipated this year. This is a major concern for an industry that generally sees investments increasing year-on-year.

​To put these investments concerns in some context, we see oil-related investment requirements of around $10 trillion over the period to 2040. This is to help meet an increase of around 17 million barrels a day over the period, with demand reaching close to 110 million barrels a day.

​New barrels are also needed to not only increase production, but to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields.

​The current environment is evidently putting this future at risk. It is vital to keep in mind the link between the marginal cost, the price and investments.

​[SLIDE 7]
​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​We need more energy. We need to reduce emissions. And we need to make sure the required investments are made.

​In the short-term, we need to try and return the market to a balanced situation. With prices returning to levels where investors feel more comfortable and confident in making the necessary long-term investments, and where supply does not outstrip demand, and vice versa.

​It is important to recall that the previous high oil-price cycle was the outcome of a lack of investment in more supply. And the low oil-price environment we find ourselves in today is the result of too much investment in high-cost production during that previous period.

​A more balanced market is clearly beneficial to us all – both producers and consumers.

​And in the long-term, we need to lay a practical and realistic energy path. It is one that requires investments in all energies, both fossil fuels and non-fossil fuels.

​OPEC recognizes that the challenges related to the environment and climate change are a concern for us all. And we will continue to push to improve energy efficiency and develop cleaner energies.

​Yes, we need to continually push to develop more renewables. Yes, we need hydropower and nuclear. And yes, we need to appreciate the need to develop cleaner fossil fuel technologies, given the future role of fossil fuels.

​Appreciating how expectations for our energy future play out over all timeframes is essential. It can help us in delivering a sustainable energy future; for all producers and for all consumers too.

"2016-01-25","Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Good morning.

I am happy to be speaking again at Chatham House’s ‘MENA Energy’ conference. It is always a pleasure to be here.

This morning I have been asked initially to share my thoughts on the outlook for the global oil market. Given events in the oil market over the past 18 months or so, there is clearly much to discuss.

[SLIDE 2]
To put it simply: the market is currently going through a significant readjustment. Since July 2014, prices have fallen by more than 70 per cent, many investments have been deferred and some cancelled, manpower has been laid off, supply has been greater than demand, stocks have risen above their five-year average, and the market has been searching for balance.

The pain of this readjustment is being felt across the industry. These are tough times. But we should also remember that ‘tough times’ are nothing new for the industry. It has been here before. The story of our industry is one of many cycles, both up and down.

We have had periods when prices were low, and periods when prices were high. We have seen times when supply outstripped demand, and times when supply has struggled to keep up. There have been long periods of stability, as well as periods of instability.

Of course, every situation is different, and in this current cycle it is important to ask the questions: how did we get here, and how might we get out?

[SLIDE 3]
It is well documented that the cycle on this occasion has been supply-driven, with most of the supply increases in recent years coming from high-cost production. Until 2015, all of the supply growth since 2008 has come from non-OPEC countries. Between 2008 and 2014, overall non-OPEC growth was more than 6 million barrels a day, while OPEC actually saw a contraction.

In fact, in 2013 and 2014, OPEC supply fell by more than 1 million barrels a day and non-OPEC grew by 3.7 million barrels a day. To put this in some context, global demand growth over these two years was 2.3 million barrels a day.

[SLIDE 4]
In 2015, this dynamic changed as expansion was seen from both non-OPEC and OPEC. Non-OPEC grew by slightly over 1.2 million barrels a day, and OPEC at around 1 million barrels a day.

[SLIDE 5]
These numbers are important when we look at the growth in OECD commercial stocks. As this graph highlights, the five-year average was at its lowest level at the end of 2013. Since then the five-year average has risen dramatically, from a negative level of 85 million barrels to a surplus of more than 260 million barrels at the end of 2015. There is no doubt this has strongly impacted crude prices.

Moreover, for the same period there has also been a rise in non-OECD inventories, plus an expansion in some non-OECD strategic petroleum reserves.

It is vital the market addresses the issue of the stock overhang. As you can see from previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling then prices start to rise.

Given how this developed, it should be viewed as something OPEC and non-OPEC tackle together. Yes, OPEC provided some of the additional supply last year, but the majority of this has come from Non-OPEC countries.

It is crucial that all major producers sit down to come up with a solution to this. The market needs to see inventories come down to levels that allow prices to recover and investments to return.

This is not only crucial for producers, but consumers too. The world desires more oil, and this means more investment.

[SLIDE 6]
OPEC sees oil demand increasing by around 17 million barrels a day between now and 2040, reaching close to 110 million barrels a day by then. And in terms of oil-related investment requirements, these are estimated to be around $10 trillion over this period.

However, the current environment is putting this future at risk. At current price levels, it is clear that not all of the necessary future investment is viable.

New barrels are needed not only to increase production, but to accommodate for decline rates from existing fields.

We need to remember that low oil prices are bad for producers today and lead to situations that are bad for consumers tomorrow. And high oil prices are bad for consumers today and lead to situations that are bad for producers tomorrow.

Thus, as I have often said, extreme prices – either too high or too low – are not in the interests of either producers or consumers.

[SLIDE 7]
Of course, there are also many other ongoing and related challenges for oil markets, such as: the uncertain prospects for the global economy; excessive speculation and the role of financial markets; the impact of geopolitics; advances in technology and their impacts on exploration and production; and environmental concerns.

Before I finish, I would like to touch briefly on the environmental challenge, following December’s ‘Paris Agreement’ to reduce climate change.

We welcome the agreement. The challenges related to the environment and climate change are a concern for us all. We all live in the same world. In this regard, we need to be practical, realistic and equitable.

Yes, we need to continue to develop renewables. But they cannot be seen as a replacement for fossil fuels in the coming decades. Combined, oil and gas are still expected to supply over 50 per cent of the global energy mix by 2040.

Yes, we need to continue to use energy more efficiently. But we need to remember that some people still have no access to modern energy services.

Yes, there are environmental concerns regarding fossil fuels. But there are ways that these can be met and overcome. We need to look at all the options available to us.

[SLIDE 8]
Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is important to recall that the previous high oil-price cycle was the outcome of a lack of investment in more supply. And the low oil-price environment we find ourselves in today is the result of too much investment in high-cost production during that previous period.

It underscores that the best way forward is for all industry stakeholders to continually work towards achieving more balance for our industry. Not only in the short-term, but in the long-term as well. This will help us deliver a sustainable energy future; for all producers and for all consumers too.

There is no doubt that the industry will come through this current cycle. Market forces, as well as cooperation among producers, will eventually lead to the return of stability.

We already see some signs that supply and demand fundamentals will start to correct themselves in 2016. Global oil demand growth this year is expected to increase by around 1.3 million barrels a day, and non-OPEC oil supply is anticipated to contract by around 660,000 barrels a day.

But as I have already highlighted, we need to see the stock overhang reduced too. This is now central to the return of a balanced market.

Tough times require tough choices. I know the industry can make these. It has in the past, and I am sure it will do this time. It is why I remain optimistic about the industry’s future.

[SLIDE 9]
Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/198-25-january-2016.html"
"2015-11-23","​Your Excellency President Rouhani, Excellencies, Heads of State of Member Countries of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), Ministers and Ambassadors, distinguished delegates, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen.

​On behalf of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, it is a great privilege to be here in The Islamic Republic of Iran, a Founding Member of OPEC, for the Third Heads of State and Government of the GECF.

​Over the past decade or so the GECF has grown in importance to its Members – a number of whom are also Members of OPEC. At OPEC, we understand the need to bring together the world’s leading gas producers to exchange experiences, views, information and data. The overall goal of the GECF is to support the sovereign rights of its Member Countries over their natural gas resources, to aid the sustainable development of these resources for the benefit of their peoples, and to help to deliver gas market stability for the benefit of both producers and consumers.

​The importance of stability has been amplified in the current energy market environment. And its significance is also clear when we look at the future requirements for both oil and gas.

​There is no doubt that the world will need more energy in the decades to come – as the global population expands to 9 billion by 2040, economies grow, and countries seek to provide the energy poor with access to modern energy services. We need to remember that many billions of people still rely on biomass for their basic needs and more than a billion still have no access to electricity.

​Global energy demand is expected to expand by around 50 per cent by 2040. In this regard, all forms of energy will be needed – wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, coal, and of course, oil and gas.

​Combined, oil and gas are still expected to supply around 53 per cent of the world’s energy by 2040. It underlines the need for major developments and significant investment.

​In terms of oil, demand is projected to grow to around 110 million barrels a day by 2040, with oil-related investment requirements estimated to be around $10 trillion between now and then.

​There is no doubt that the world has enough oil and natural gas resources to meet the expected future needs. The most recent analysis for the remaining ultimately recoverable oil resources puts the figure at 2.8 trillion barrels. And for natural gas, it is over 420 trillion standard cubic metres.

​It should be underscored that despite the continuing cumulative production, these numbers have increased over the past five decades.

​Moreover, these numbers do not take into account the large amounts of available unconventional oil and gas resources.

​Of course, as well as opportunities, there will be challenges too. For instance, there is the global economy, human resources, technology, investments and the environment and climate change.

​In terms of the environment and climate change – we need to remember that this is a concern for us all.

​Current climate change negotiations to develop an agreement in Paris next month and raise the level of ambitions for the pre-2020 period are extremely important. But we need to make sure the interests and concerns of all of us are taken into account.

​Overall, we need to keep in mind that the three pillars of sustainable development – ‘economic, environmental and social’ – mean different things to different people.

​Your Excellencies,

​There is much our industries share. And there is much we can learn from each other. Given the ever-increasing interdependence between energies, and between nations, there is a need to continually enhance dialogue and cooperation, with innovative thinking and collaboration, where and when appropriate. This important Summit symbolizes that.

​With that, allow me to thank our hosts today, the Islamic Republic of Iran, for the hospitality given to us, and the arrangements provided.

​And we would like to wish the GECF all the best in meeting its mission and future objectives.

​Excellencies, thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/199-23-november-2015.html"
"2015-11-09","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Good morning.

​I would like to thank His Excellency Mohammed bin Saleh Al Sada and his staff at Qatar’s Ministry of Energy and Industry, as well as the International Energy Forum, for the invitation to speak at this 6th Asian Ministerial Energy Roundtable. It is a pleasure to be here in Doha.

​And I would also like to thank our Chair this morning, His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia’s Vice Minister for Petroleum and Mineral Resources, for his introduction. I look forward to our discussions in this opening plenary session.

​There is evidently much for us to discuss, given events in the oil market over the past 18 months or so. Since July 2014, the market has witnessed a great deal of volatility. Prices have fallen by 60 per cent, many investments have been deferred or even cancelled, manpower has been laid off, supply has been greater than demand, stocks have risen above their five-year average, and the market has been searching for balance.

​It leads me to the question asked by this session: have recent events created ‘a new normal’ for the oil market, or is it just ‘another cycle’ in the oil industry’s history?

​The industry has gone through many cycles. We have had periods when prices were low, and periods when prices were high. We have seen times when supply outstripped demand, and times when supply has struggled to keep up. There have been long periods of stability, as well as some periods of instability.

​I am sure some of us here can recall the supply and demand challenges of the early 1980s and the price drop in 1985-1986. The OPEC Reference Basket fell from around $25/b in November 1985 to just $8/b in July 1986.

​In 1997 and 1998 there was the Asian financial crisis, and another price drop. The OPEC Reference Basket fell from around $20/b in October 1997 to $9/b in December 1998.

​In the early years of the last decade we saw strong demand growth, particularly in Asia, which led to rising prices.

​And at the end of 2008 there was the global financial crisis, when prices dropped from around $140/b to the mid-$30 range.

​The current cycle was triggered by oversupply. But what is different on this occasion is that most of the supply increases in recent years have come from high-cost production. The market is now taking on board this new reality and gradually resetting itself, as we can see with falling non-OPEC supply growth and stronger demand.

​As with previous cycles, the industry will come through this one. In fact, cycles have helped make it increasingly resilient and more efficient. Our industry is built on strong foundations.

​Nevertheless, we should recognize that each cycle does bring with it changes and challenges.

​For example, from 2014 to 2015 the industry has seen a fall in exploration and production investment of around $130 billion. This equates to a 20 per cent drop.

​And questions are being asked as to what might be the medium- and long-term impacts of the recent manpower cuts, particularly given that the industry was experiencing critical shortages even before this cycle.

​Of course, there are also many other ongoing challenges: the uncertain prospects for the global economy; environmental issues and concerns; excessive speculation and the role of financial markets; the impact of geopolitics; and advances in technology and their impacts on exploration and production, to name just a few.

​Moreover, many new factors may be just around the corner; there are always unknowns.

​So while cycles come and go, we need to appreciate that the industry never stands still.

​This brings me to the second question of the session: ‘what does it mean for Asia?’

​Asia has a number of significant producers, but overall it is a major importer of crude and products. Thus, the price fall will no doubt have been beneficial to many of its economies. We should also recall that many Asian economies flourished during periods of higher prices.

​However, low prices for a long time are not good for anyone. The same goes for high prices.

​The industry will need to supply more oil in the future, much of it going to the Asian region. And this will need more investment.

​We see oil demand increasing by around 17 million barrels a day between now and 2040, reaching close to 110 million barrels a day by then. And 70 per cent of this growth alone is expected to come from the developing Asia region.

​It will mean that over the next 25 years or so Asia will see energy and oil imports increase from almost all regions – but mainly from the Middle East, where many OPEC Members are located. Let me stress here that all our Member Countries remain committed to making sure customers receive secure and regular oil supplies to meet their demand needs.

​In terms of oil-related investment requirements, these are estimated to be around $10 trillion between now and 2040. There are huge investments that need to be made.

​Thus, it is vital to keep in mind the link between the marginal cost, the price and investments. It leads to me the question: are current prices at a level that will see all the necessary future investments take place? It is clear they are not. At current price levels not all of the necessary future investment is viable.

​Given that Asia is central to the global oil market’s future, as the engine of economic growth and oil demand in the decades ahead, it is vital the region understands the oil market’s short- and long-term market dynamics.

​It is clear that the importance of dialogue between the world’s energy stakeholders – especially in terms of bringing together producers and consumers together – has never been greater. In this regard, I am sure we can all appreciate the benefits of this Roundtable.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Allow me to finish by bringing us back to today. The expectation is that the market will return to more balance in 2016. We see global oil demand maintaining its recent healthy growth. We see less non-OPEC supply. And we see an increase in the demand for OPEC crude.

​A more balanced market is clearly beneficial to us all – both producers and consumers.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/200-9-november-2015.html"
"2015-10-11","​Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good evening.

​I would like to begin by thanking His Excellency Dr. Ali Saleh Al-Omair, Kuwait’s Minister of Oil, for his invitation to Kuwait, and the invitation to attend this conference organized by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. It always gives me great pleasure to come back to Kuwait – one of the founding Members of OPEC.
​ 
​[SLIDE 2]
​I think we can all appreciate that the three key themes of this session – ‘Innovation, Technology and Opportunities’ – are not only vital to developing the industry’s future hydrocarbon reserves and other related activities, they have also been central to its past.

​Looking back to 1960, the year OPEC was founded, global crude oil production was just 21 million barrels a day. Today, it is around 75 million barrels a day. This is an increase of over 250 per cent. On top of this, we also need to factor in the rise of other liquids, which currently add up to close to 18 million barrels a day.

​In terms of natural gas, production was close to 445 billion standard cubic metres in 1960. Today, it has risen to almost 3.6 trillion standard cubic metres. This is an increase of over 700 per cent.

​This growth has been driven by innovation, human ingenuity and technology. They have helped to continually transform and reinvent the industry by turning challenges into opportunities.

​[SLIDE 3]
​For example, our industry has seen technological innovation move E&P opportunities from onshore to offshore, then to deep water and frontier regions, and most recently to unconventionals.

​Improvements in the quantity and quality of information about different geological structures have meant we have been able to find more oil and gas.

​When looking at recovery rates, technological developments have helped increase these from less than 10 per cent of oil in place in the early history of the industry to more than 70 per cent in some fields today.

​Advancements have also improved the safety of our industry; for those working in it, and also in terms of exploration, production and supply. And they have allowed us to continually improve the environmental credentials of oil and gas, both in production and use.

​[SLIDE 4]
​Looking ahead, there is no doubt that the world will need more energy in the decades to come – as the global population expands, economies grow, and countries seek to provide the energy poor with access to modern energy services. We need to remember that many billions of people still rely on biomass for their basic needs and more than a billion still have no access to electricity.

​To 2040, global energy demand is expected to expand by around 50 per cent. In this regard, all forms of energy will be needed – wind, solar, hydro, nuclear and of course fossil fuels, which will continue to play the major role in meeting demand. This growth will require some major investments.

​In terms of oil, with demand projected to grow to 110 million barrels a day by 2040, oil-related investment requirements are estimated to be around $10 trillion between now and then.

​With all this in mind, let me stress that there is no doubt that the world has enough oil and energy resources to meet these expected future needs.

​The most recent analysis for the remaining ultimately recoverable oil resources puts the figure at 2.8 trillion barrels. And for natural gas, it is over 420 trillion standard cubic metres.

​It should be underscored that despite the continuing cumulative production, these numbers have increased over the past five decades.

​Moreover, these numbers do not take into account the large amounts of available unconventional oil and gas resources.

​[SLIDE 5]
​The industry’s past successes are a reminder that innovation and new technologies are key to unlocking the abundant sources of oil and energy in an ever more sound, secure and responsible manner.

​In the coming years and decades, the industry can expect to see additional new technologies shift perceptions and prospects once more. This will be achieved through such developments as carbon capture and storage, advancements in enhanced oil recovery and the development of new oil-based materials for various industry sectors.

​It all points to the simple facts that the industry’s future will require more R&D; it will need more investment; and it will need more people.

​Here allow me to focus on the most important element that will determine the industry’s future: the human one. At its heart, the oil business is about people. All the innovation, technology and opportunities that are created in the industry depend to a great extent on the availability of talented and skilled people.

​Unfortunately, even before the recent cuts in manpower, the industry was experiencing critical shortages. The reasons for this are varied.

​For one, there is a sizeable section of the industry’s workforce now rapidly approaching retirement. At the same time, the dramatic expansion in the services industry and ‘emerging knowledge’ economies has led to a fierce competition for talent.

​And the enrollment of students in energy-related programmes continues to be a challenge. Globally there is a shortage of young people entering the industry. It is vital that this is rectified.

​It is the sustained support for the industry’s scientists, engineers and visionaries – the people who create new ventures, new technologies and new techniques – that will drive our industry forward and expand supplies.

​[SLIDE 6]
​Of course, we need to appreciate that the development of future hydrocarbon resources is directly linked to the short-, medium- and long-terms. None of these timeframes can be looked at in isolation.

​Here, it is essential to appreciate the delicate balance between prices, the cost of the marginal barrel and future supplies. This balance is vital in making sure the right enabling environment is in place and the necessary future investments are made.

​If the right signals are not forthcoming, there is the possibility that innovation will dry up, that technological breakthroughs will not materialize and that not enough new capacity and infrastructure will be in place in time to meet future rising demand levels.

​Yes, we need to keep our eyes firmly on the future, given the fact that oil is expected to be fundamental to the lives of many more people in the years ahead. But we also need to focus on the immediate challenges as the market searches for more stability during the current period of volatility.

​Stability is paramount. It is essential to have clarity in terms of our oil and energy future – whether this is 1, 5, 10 or even 20 years ahead.

​It is quite clear that the past 16 months or so have been an extremely challenging time for the oil industry. Prices fell almost 60 per cent between June 2014 and January 2015, although we do not believe that actual market fundamentals warranted this huge drop. Prices this year have fluctuated mainly in the $40 to $60 per barrel range. But again there has been significant volatility with the market seeing price spikes and falls that have been very loosely connected with changes in fundamentals.

​The market remains over-supplied and stock levels have risen above their five-year average. However, it should be noted that we have recently seen a contraction in production from some non-OPEC producers and an uptick in demand growth.

​Developments over the past year or so have led to a number of projects being cancelled or put on hold. Investment plans have been revised. Rig counts have fallen dramatically. And redundancies have being made.

​These changes certainly offer up questions for this session: How might the current industry cycle impact the development of future hydrocarbon resources? And more specifically, what might this mean in terms of innovation, technology and opportunities?

​Some cost cutting and efficiency measures will make the industry a little more nimble and agile. But with less investment, fewer project developments and reduced manpower on the scale that we have witnessed recently, the industry will no doubt be impacted in the short- and medium-term – and potentially, in the long-term too.

​However, as my speech today has emphasized, we need to keep investing. It is essential for our industry’s future. It is essential to all those consumers around the world who rely on hydrocarbon resources for their everyday needs. And it will be essential to the future of those currently without access to modern energy services.

​[SLIDE 7]
​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​I remain confident that our industry’s best days are yet to come. We have an abundance of hydrocarbon resources. And oil and gas demand continues to grow. All of this points to tremendous opportunities.

​To turn existing and future challenges into promising opportunities, however, requires strength, resilience and vision. And this means working towards more stability in the market.

​At OPEC, we are hopeful that the industry will see a more balanced oil market in 2016. But we should keep in mind the fundamental importance of ensuring that the people in our industry continually push for innovation and the development of new technologies, that can help discover, extract, produce and supply more hydrocarbons in an ever more cost effective and sustainable manner.

"2015-06-03","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​I would like to begin by thanking everyone here today for being part of the 6th OPEC International Seminar. As OPEC Secretary General, it is an honour to see so many international experts attending, and to see many distinguished and high-level speakers on the agenda. I hope you all find the 6th OPEC International Seminar an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

​For this session, I would also like to extend my thanks to our Chairman, His Excellency Ali I. Naimi, for agreeing to Chair the session and for his introductions, and to my fellow panelists for agreeing to participate.
​ 
​[SLIDE 2]
​In reviewing the outlook for the global energy scene – the focus of this session – I believe there is one point that we can all agree on.

​The world will need more energy in the decades ahead, as the global population expands and economies grow, and as countries seek to provide the energy poor with access to modern energy services, the global need for energy will grow. In OPEC’s most recent World Oil Outlook, energy demand is set to increase by around 50% between 2015 and 2040.

​I think that most of us here today also understand that the world has enough energy resources to meet these expected future energy needs. The key questions about our energy future relate to deliverability and sustainability.

​In this regard, it is important to take on board all of the economic, social and environmental perspectives that feed into it.

​The basic challenge is twofold:

​Firstly, to supply enough energy to meet demand and help provide access to modern energy services for all.

​And secondly, this needs to be done in a sustainable way, balancing the needs of people in relation to their social welfare, the economy and the environment.

​It is clear that all forms of energy will be needed. But it is crucial that we appreciate just what each energy source can provide in the future.

​[SLIDE 3]
​Renewables – from wind, solar, small hydro and geothermal – certainly hold promise, but globally their share of the energy mix will still be just 4 per cent by 2040, given their low initial base.

​The share of biomass, nuclear and large hydro is expected to remain at steady levels throughout the period 2015-to-2040, at around 9 per cent, 6 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively.

​This means that fossil fuels will continue to play a dominant role in meeting energy demand, although their overall share will fall from around 82 to 78 per cent during this period. By the 2030s, the share of oil, coal and gas are anticipated to be at similar levels, at around 25 to 27 per cent.

​[SLIDE 4]
​Others will obviously have different views on how they see the future global energy mix. This is natural. But I think it is important to emphasize four key words: practical, realistic, logical and equitable.

​Over the past two centuries or more, much of our economic growth has been fuelled by the exploitation of fossil fuels. This has certainly brought real benefits. It has helped improve living standards by providing such things as light, power and mobility. It has enabled the development of industries and the creation of jobs. And it has helped increase life expectancies. In short, the industrialized world has been built with fossil fuels.

​However, we should not forget that this has not been the story for everyone. When we start up our cars, switch on a light, turn on our mobile phones, we need to recognize that these everyday things are still unknown to billions of people across the world who continue to suffer from energy poverty.

​Today, around 2.7 billion people or more still rely on biomass for their basic needs, and 1.3 billion have no access to electricity. These are people that need their voices heard. They need access to reliable, safe and secure modern energy services to live and prosper. We all want to improve our lives.

​Of course, the economics of wanting more, coupled with growing populations and rising energy demand, has created challenges that were not foreseen at the time when Thomas Edison was developing the light bulb, or when Henry Ford was mass producing the car.

​I am talking here about the environment and climate change. This is a concern for us all.

​Current climate change negotiations to develop an agreement in Paris at the end of the year and raise the level of ambitions for the pre-2020 period are extremely important. But we need to make sure the interests and concerns of all of us are taken into account.

​With this in mind, I will again repeat the four words: practical, realistic, logical and equitable.

​Yes, we need to continue to develop renewables. But they cannot be seen as a replacement for fossil fuels in the coming decades.

​Yes, we need to continue to use energy more efficiently. But we need to remember that some people still have no access to modern energy services.

​Yes, there are environmental concerns regarding fossil fuels. But there are ways that these can be met and overcome.

​This includes pushing for the development and use of cleaner fossil fuel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage. At OPEC, we recognize the importance of continually looking to advance the environmental credentials of oil, both in production and use.
​ 
​Overall, we need to keep in mind that the three pillars of sustainable development – ‘economic, environmental and social’ – mean different things to different people. 

​[SLIDE 5]
​What I hope to have underscored is the importance of having a clear understanding of our energy future – whether this is 5, 10 or even 20 years ahead. As you know, there is a fine balance between stability and instability in energy markets.

​Looking ahead, from the perspective of oil we see demand growing to 111 million barrels a day by 2040, an increase of around 18 million barrels a day. This expansion will require huge investments.

​It means we need to have clarity in terms of demand and, in turn, supply.

​This requires an understanding of the impact of the energy and environmental policies that are already in place, and those that are proposed.
​ 
​Producers and investors will obviously want to see some signs of certainty; no-one wants to waste huge amounts of capital on unused plants and equipment. But if these signs are not forthcoming, we could find that there is not enough new capacity and infrastructure in place to meet rising demand levels.

​And for oil producers, it is important to recognize that they cannot standstill. They need to think about an affordable, balanced and sustainable future.
​ 
​Yes, oil is part of this future, but diversity is essential. They need to look for alternative sources of income. And they need to develop other sources of energy, particularly when many have distinct advantages in terms of solar and wind.

​[SLIDE 6]
​Clearly, there are also a number of other uncertainties and challenges facing the industry. We are all obviously aware of the current market situation. It is essential that stability returns to the market, to allow for the necessary investments to be made to meet future energy demand. This is something OPEC always strives for, and it is in the interests of all parties.

​In addition, there are other factors to consider: the uncertain prospects for the global economy; ongoing concerns about excessive speculation and the role of financial markets; the impact of geopolitics; potential manpower shortages in the years ahead; and advances in technology and their impacts on exploration and production. And many new factors may be just around the corner. There are always unknowns.

​As an industry, there are many challenges and uncertainties we can face together.
​ 
​We appreciate the continued dialogue we see between producers and consumers. It is essential to have a producer-consumer environment that is conducive to reaching constructive end results.

​We also welcome recent OPEC and non-OPEC discussions. I have read many reports that suggest OPEC is targeting specific non-OPEC countries or producers with its decisions. This is not true. We welcome all energies. We welcome all producers.

​In the current market environment, I think we can all appreciate that the challenge of maintaining the supply-demand balance and reaching price stability requires the cooperation of major non-OPEC producers. We should remember what cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers achieved back in the 1998-1999 crisis.

​[SLIDE 7]
​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​While none of us can plot the exact path of our energy future, I think we can all agree that our shared objective must be a stable and sustainable energy future for all.

​Feeding into this are issues related to social welfare, economics and the environment; the views of developed and developing countries; those who have access to modern energy services and those who do not; and the need for all of us to be practical, realistic, logical and equitable when thinking and planning our global energy future.

"2015-06-03","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome to Vienna’s Hofburg Palace for the 6th OPEC International Seminar, held under the theme ‘Petroleum: An Engine for Global Development’. It is the fourth time we have held the Seminar in this splendid historic building. It has certainly proven to be the perfect setting for our high-level deliberations. The OPEC Seminar allows us to examine in some detail the main issues affecting the oil industry. It also provides an important yardstick as to where we stand today in a global context.

This year actually marks a special milestone in OPEC’s close and highly valued ties with the Federal Republic of Austria and the City of Vienna … it is our golden anniversary! The Organization feels privileged to have been able to call this outstanding international city home for the past half century.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

As you all aware, the last nine months or so have been particularly challenging for the oil industry. Crude oil prices lost half their value as crude oversupply and speculation combined to upset the relative stability seen in oil markets over the previous years. It has proved to be an especially difficult time for some of the industry’s main stakeholders, resulting in huge revenue and job losses and threatening investment in future production capacity.

However, looking at the oil market today, there are a number of reasons to feel more optimistic about the general situation going forward. The global economic recovery is showing encouraging signs, oil demand is improving. Indeed, going by current trends, there should be a more balanced market in the second half of the year.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Of course, we are not out of the woods yet and we are still faced with a lot of uncertainty. That is why we must remain vigilant and keep our attention firmly fixed on the future. We know full well that the oil industry will continue to face new challenges and these will require new solutions. Fortunately, we now have the benefit of many years of experience to assist us in our endeavours. Our industry is today supported by highly trained personnel who are making the optimum use of the latest technology available to develop both conventional and non-conventional sources of petroleum.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is clear to us in OPEC that the extraordinary advances already witnessed in the 21st century require the collaboration of all the main parties associated with the global petroleum sector if we are to move forward in an efficient and orderly fashion.

OPEC’s commitment to market order and stability is unwavering. It has a long tradition of supporting collective dialogue among producers and between the producers and consumers. We have always realized that all the main players need to work together to solve the challenges facing the industry. We also need to be aware of and ready for the obstacles that are sure to arise in the future. This Seminar is part of our ongoing effort to promote dialogue and cooperation with the industry’s stakeholders from around the world.

Over the next two days you will hear presentations and debates on the main facets of the global energy scene. These will include oil market stability, production capacity and investment, technology and the environment, and prospects for the world economy. Through the lively discussions that are sure to follow, we will undoubtedly learn from one another by exchanging valuable viewpoints.

And who could be more qualified to discuss these issues than the men and women who have left their indelible mark on the industry and who continue to capably lead it today? This includes our own OPEC Ministers and Ministers from other oil-producing countries, heads of intergovernmental organizations, chief executives of national and international oil companies, industry analysts, academics and the media. The wisdom and insights from these leaders will undoubtedly enrich our discussions.

OPEC also recognizes the importance of developing new talent. For this reason, it has invited students to attend the Seminar. Through the high-level discussions, they will learn more about global energy markets and the role of oil in the world economy. We welcome these individuals who will likely carry the industry’s torch into the future.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

At this point, I should like to thank all those who have been involved in organising this event, under the overall direction of His Excellency Abdalla Salem El-Badri, OPEC Secretary General.

Thank you for your kind attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/203-3-june-2015.html"
"2015-03-08","​Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Good afternoon.

​I would like to begin by thanking the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain for the invitation to address the 19th Middle East Oil & Gas Conference. It is a pleasure to be here in Manama.

​Over the years, the global oil and gas industry has gone through a number of cycles and changes that have required the industry to adapt and evolve. There is no doubt that the last nine months has been one of those intermittent periods of volatility, after several years of stability.

​In terms of oil, I am often asked what has been behind the recent volatility. There are evidently some key factors.

​The global economy continues to offer up both optimistic and pessimistic indicators, although we do see global economic growth next year at 3.4 per cent, compared to 3.2 per cent in 2014.

​There have been rising supplies from non-OPEC producers. In fact, since 2008 non-OPEC supply has risen by almost 6 million barrels a day. In contrast, OPEC’s production has been fairly steady at around 30 million barrels a day.

​Oil demand in 2014 was weaker than originally projected at the beginning of that year, although we do expect higher growth this year. In 2014, oil demand growth was just below 1 million barrels a day, while this year it is expected to rise to around 1.2 million barrels a day.

​It means that the supply and demand balance in the first half of 2015 points to an oversupply of around 2 million barrels a day, although the market should return to balance during the second half of the year.

​I should stress, however, we do not believe that actual market fundamentals warranted the almost 60 per cent drop in prices that the market saw between June 2014 and January 2015. It is clear that speculators also played a role in this fall.

​Of course, the current lower price environment is a test for all producers and investors. Lower oil prices mean less revenue. And less revenue means tighter budgets. While prices will no doubt rebound, as they have done lately, it is clear that the industry is currently witnessing a landscape that is shifting the global oil industry.

​For example, a number of projects are being cancelled or put on hold, rig counts have fallen dramatically, investment plans are being revised, costs are being cut and squeezed, and redundancies have been made.

​These are the current realities. It is a challenging time for the industry. However, there are clearly many things that the industry can do with one eye on the current situation, and one eye on the future.

​It is important to look at new ways to reduce costs and achieve more efficient working practices.

​It is vital as an industry to enhance collaboration between National Oil Companies, International Oil Companies, service providers, as well as other industry stakeholders, to help further streamline the industry and discuss views on the industry’s future.

​It is essential to maintain R&D initiatives and to continually develop technologies that can help in discovering, extracting and producing more hydrocarbon reserves in an ever more cost effective and sustainable manner.

​And for producers, it may be useful to use the situation of lower oil prices to create incentives to use energy more efficiently and implement sustainable policies that could lay the groundwork for more diversified and less energy-dependent economies.

​The reason we need to keep our eyes on the longer term is because energy demand is expected to increase by 60 per cent by 2040, with fossils fuels remaining central to the energy mix. The world will need more oil investments and the MENA region will be central to this.

​In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2014, oil-related investment requirements are estimated to be around $10 trillion between now and 2040. And oil demand is seen increasing by around 21 million barrels a day to 111 million barrels a day by 2040, with Asia accounting for almost three-quarters of this growth. The MENA region is clearly perfectly-positioned to supply Asia’s ever-expanding demand for oil and gas.

​However, as we all know, no-one can make precise predictions about the future. History tells us that things rarely stay the same. The past nine months have demonstrated this.

​There is no doubt that the market and its stakeholders will have to evolve to ever-changing circumstances and challenges in the years ahead. Alongside the current market situation, these include uncertainties that we can call ‘known’ uncertainties. These include the potential impact of UN climate change negotiations; the role of financial markets and oil market speculation; energy policies in some consuming countries; manpower bottlenecks; advances in technology; and rising costs.

​And there are also ‘unknown’ uncertainties. These are most often related to geopolitics and severe weather events.

​However, it is important to stress that the oil business has been dealing with change and uncertainty since its very early days. We cannot avoid cyclical events, when prices rise and fall, and we cannot avoid challenges. It is the nature of the market. 

​But there are clearly tremendous opportunities too. Despite the recent volatility and current uncertainties, there is no doubt that the industry has a healthy long-term future. 

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/204-8-march-2015.html"
"2014-06-16","​Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good afternoon.

​On behalf of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, it is a great honour to be here at the World Petroleum Congress in Moscow.

​This global congress attracts speakers and delegates from all corners of the world. It is an ideal platform to bring together NOCs, IOCs, service companies, international organizations, analysts and the media to discuss today’s most pressing energy issues. 

​And our hosts, the Russian Federation, are a perfect choice for this event – a country with a long history of providing energy to the world.

​Russia is a truly global energy power, with the largest combined oil and gas reserves, as well as the highest combined production of oil and gas.

​It is currently the largest producer at 10.5 million barrels a day and is the second largest crude oil exporter, behind Saudi Arabia. And on the natural gas side, it is the largest exporter, with close to 20 per cent of the world’s exports. OPEC Member Country Qatar is the second largest.

​I will not go into too much detail now about Russian energy, given that my fellow panelists are from the country’s three leading energy companies. But there is potential for enhanced oil recovery in fields in Western Siberia and the Volga Urals, and through exploration and production in greenfields in Eastern Siberia and the Yamal Peninsula.

​Of course, the future outlook is leading the country into new frontiers, with harder to access resources that require new technologies and significant investment. There is no doubt that Russia has the resources to meet these challenges.

​Russia is also ideally placed to serve as an energy hub, sitting between the markets of Europe and Asia, with the latter expected to be the largest energy demand centre by far in the years ahead. The recent 30-year deal between Russia and China for Gazprom to deliver Russian gas to China is a clear sign that Asian demand will grow significantly in the coming decades.

​Given all this, there is no doubt that Russia will be a central element to our global energy future.

​It is a future where energy demand is expected to rise by 52 per cent by 2035.

​Where natural gas and oil will still meet over 50 per cent of the world’s energy needs by 2035.

​And one where the world needs to bring modern energy services to those currently living without them. We need to remember that 2.7 billion people still rely on biomass for their basic needs, and 1.3 billion have no access to electricity. Energy is a major enabler in spreading economic prosperity and growth.

​Our global energy future is one in which none of us can act alone. Any talk of ‘energy independence’ is just that. We do not live in a world of independent energy nations. Our future will increasingly be one of energy inter-dependence.

​The interconnected and international nature of energy markets are tying us together as never before. And with energy remaining central to each and every one of us, it is critical that all stakeholders work together for a secure, stable and sustainable energy future.

​In this increasingly complex, challenging and ever-expanding energy system we need to recognize the importance of dialogue and cooperation – to help all stakeholders find common ground; to look for shared solutions; and to help bring about the market stability we all need.

​Obviously, we will not find agreement on everything. We do not live in a perfect world. But at OPEC, we have long recognized the importance of adopting cooperative approaches when addressing major topical issues – involving dialogue with countries, international organizations, and other interested parties. This applies to both direct oil industry matters, as well as other related areas such as environmental protection and sustainable development.

​It is easy to appreciate where dialogue and cooperation among stakeholders can help meet some of the challenges that our industry will face in the years ahead.

​These challenges are broad and varied. They include developments in the global economic recovery; the potential impact of UN climate change negotiations; the role of financial markets and oil market speculation; consuming country energy policies; a shortage of human capital; advances in technology; and rising costs.

​Here, it pleases me to talk about the healthy dialogue that exists between Russia and OPEC. Our talks over the years have been wide-ranging, focusing on such issues as the state of the world energy market, its long-term prospects and associated challenges, the global refining situation, and tight oil and shale gas developments.

​And of course, this relationship spreads to bilateral energy ties with many of our Member Countries. For example, Russia’s Lukoil recently started oil production from the giant West Qurna-2 oil field in Iraq; Russian companies are involved in helping develop Venezuela’s Orinoco belt; and there are partnerships between Russian companies and a number of our other Member Countries.

​I should also add here that OPEC engages in excellent and productive international dialogue and cooperation with various other parties. This includes the European Union, the International Energy Agency, the International Energy Forum and the G-20.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​I am sure you will all agree that, as an industry, we need to focus on what we do best – providing energy to the world. Russia is part of this. OPEC is part of this. NOCs and IOCs are part of this. In fact, we are all part of this.

​Our focus needs to be on maintaining market stability. This was central to OPEC’s decision last week to maintain the Organization’s existing production levels of 30 million barrels a day. This is what is required by the market. We see a balanced and stable oil market today.

​And looking at market indicators, we expect this to be the case for the rest of 2014. There is steady demand growth and enough supply to meet demand, with both stocks and spare capacity at comfortable levels.

​Stability is central to everything we do. It is the concern that links us all. And this is best achieved when all stakeholders better understand each other, through the enhancement of dialogue and cooperation. I am sure this will be apparent over the coming week.

​With that, I wish all those involved all the best for the next few days.

​Thank you for your attention. ​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/205-16-june-2014.html"
"2014-05-15","Mr Prime Minister, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Good morning.

I would like to begin by thanking the Russian Government for hosting this important event, to the International Energy Forum (IEF) for helping organize it, and to co-hosts Iraq and the United Kingdom for their support.

The theme of this session is ‘The New Geography of Energy: Business as Usual or a New Era for Energy Supply and Demand?’

[SLIDE 2]
Allow me to initially look at the present oil market situation.

Today, we see a relatively balanced market. And looking at market indicators, we expect this to be the case for the rest of 2014. There is steady demand growth and enough supply to meet demand, with both stocks and spare capacity at comfortable levels.

OPEC crude production is currently close to 30 million barrels a day. This is what is required by the market. OPEC is making sure its consumer’s needs are being met. 

And in terms of prices, they have held fairly steady for the past two years or so, at a level that has been acceptable to both producers and consumers.

[SLIDE 3]
Turning to the future, I will begin by looking at the supply outlook.

There has been talk that the supply side is undergoing something of a ‘revolution’ as new sources, particularly from outside of OPEC, enter the market. These are developments that some have suggested will transform the oil market forever.

But we need to be careful about what these changes really mean. It is essential that we put things into some context, and examine the market over all timeframes.

Over the past few years we have seen an upswing in non-OPEC liquid supplies. However, I should highlight that between 2009 and 2013, OPEC and non-OPEC each provided about 3 million barrels a day of additional production.

In the medium-term, the non-OPEC supply expansion will continue. We see it increasing by over 4 million barrels a day between 2013 and 2018. Over the same period it means the call on OPEC liquids remains fairly stable.

Thus, non-OPEC supply will play an important role in the coming few years. However, this should be viewed as a periodic shift.

This is apparent when looking at the developments of one of the main medium-term drivers for non-OPEC liquids. Here, I am talking about North American tight oil.

This is a welcome addition. Tight oil adds depth and diversity to the market. But questions remain over its sustainability in the long-term. We see North American tight oil, including NGLs, reaching 4.9 million barrels a day by 2017/2018, before declining thereafter.

Many tight oil wells are experiencing sharp decline rates, which means that operators need to ‘drill, drill, drill’ just to maintain production. And, production costs remain high.

 [SLIDE 4]
In the long-term, non-OPEC supply expansion will slow. And after 2018, it is OPEC that is expected to supply much of the additional liquids capacity. OPEC is expected to supply around 11 million barrels a day of additional liquids between 2018 and 2035. In contrast, the figure for non-OPEC additions is 3 million barrels a day.

While we can expect to see an increase in the importance of non-crude supplies, in general, the long-term oil supply picture could be deemed to be ‘business-as-usual’. Investments from OPEC and non-OPEC will be required – not only to add new production, but also to maintain existing capacity.

Let me stress that OPEC Member Countries continue to make investments. However, future investments will be influenced by various factors – such as policies, the price of oil and overall economic conditions.

The upshot of all this is that the MENA region will continue to be the main hub for global oil supply. And it will be ideally positioned to meet ever-expanding demand from Asia.

[SLIDE 5]
In many respects it is the demand side that will bring about most change. Global demand is expected to increase by around 20 million barrels a day between 2012 and 2035, with over 88 per cent of this expansion in the developing Asia region.

Moreover, non-OECD oil demand is expected to surpass that of the OECD in the second half of 2014, although oil use per head in non-OECD regions remains much lower.

The shift in demand towards Asia is, of course, nothing new. It is an ongoing trend. But the implications of this shift could significantly alter oil trade and the downstream landscape in the coming decades. For example, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to see an increase in crude and product imports from practically all producing regions, led by the Middle East.

Middle East crude oil exports to the Asia-Pacific are expected to increase from 13 million barrels a day in 2012 to almost 18 million barrels a day by 2035. Product exports from the Middle East to the Asia-Pacific region also expand, by 1 million barrels a day by 2035.

This demand trend is also expected to see a continued shift in downstream investment away from the OECD to non-OECD regions, particularly Asia and the Middle East. We are already seeing significant developments and downstream capacity expansion in the non-OECD. And as demand shifts, other parts of the world are likely to see a combination of some expansion and further refinery closures.

[SLIDE 6]
It is evident from both supply and demand perspectives that the future requires significant investments. Cumulative upstream, midstream and downstream investment requirements, including maintenance and upgrading, are expected to be around $8 trillion by 2035.

These investments require a stable market environment. In this regard, I would like to highlight two key issues:

Firstly, there is the importance of continually looking to mitigate extreme price volatility and excessive speculation. 

As I have already mentioned, we have seen prices hold steady over the past two years or so, especially when compared to some of the preceding years. However, it is important to keep a watchful eye over speculative activities. This is something OPEC has been discussing with the IEF and the IEA, with the 4th Joint Workshop on the Interactions between Physical and Financial Energy Markets recently held in Vienna. The Workshop forms part of a wider joint programme of work between our three organizations.

Secondly, we need to think about the relationship between prices and the cost of the marginal barrel.

Given the complexities of the oil market, it is difficult to specify a single number that represents the marginal cost. But it is evident that the cost of some oil sands projects, tight oil plays, deepwater and Arctic fields are the most likely to represent the marginal cost.

This raises the question: at what price level would some of these projects become unworkable? For some of these projects, it may not be far below current price levels.

[SLIDE 7]
Of course, we cannot presume the future will turn out to be how we view it today. History tells us that things rarely stay the same. And in the years ahead, the market will have to evolve to adapt to ever-changing circumstances.

Today there are uncertainties that we can call ‘known’. They include the potential impact of UN climate change negotiations; the role of financial markets and oil market speculation; energy policies in some consuming countries; manpower bottlenecks; advances in technology; and rising costs. And there are also ‘unknowns’ – most often related to geopolitics and severe weather patterns.

Nevertheless, I can underline a number of key takeaways from my speech today:

To conclude I should like to stress that there is no doubt that our future will increasingly be one of interdependence. We do not live in a world of independent energy nations.

This connectedness – and the ever more complex nature of our industry – points to the need to continually enhance dialogue and cooperation, with innovative thinking, collaboration and swift action between stakeholders, where and when appropriate. This important meeting symbolizes that.

This can only help all of us to strive to ensure the market stability that we all require – to deliver the goal we all desire: ensuring sustainable energy for all.

"2014-04-11","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good afternoon.

​I would like to begin by thanking the organizers of this event for inviting me to the 15th International Oil Summit. It is a pleasure to be here.

​In looking at the overview of this session, it is clear that there is a specific focus on global oil supply, both now and in the future. There is mention of an abundance of supply, and the potential for production increases in both OPEC and non-OPEC countries.

​It is interesting to see such topics now listed on conference agendas, given that only a few years ago there was much talk of there not being enough resources, and that supply would struggle to keep up with demand.

​But today we hear very few voices talking about ‘peak oil’. There are clearly plenty of available resources – both conventional and non-conventional – to meet expanding future oil demand.

​At OPEC, we have been consistent in voicing our opinion that the world has enough resources to meet expected demand. And technological advancements continue to help the industry increase the estimates of the amount of oil and gas that can be found, and that can be recovered, extending its reach into harsher and more remote locations in ‘frontier areas’. What was once described as ‘impossible’ oil has today become ‘possible’.

​Of course, peak oil will come one day. It is a non-renewable resource – but not for the foreseeable future.

​So what has happened to change the focus from talk of peak oil and tight supply?

​It is evident that non-OPEC supply developments have been a central element in this change, particularly US tight oil. These tight oil developments are welcome. They add depth and diversity to global supply, aid market stability and provide further proof that the world is not running out of oil.

​In a 2013 report, the US Energy Information Administration’s assessment of technically recoverable global tight oil resources was 345 billion barrels. This was much higher than its 2011 assessment of 32 billion barrels. And these estimates are likely to change again in the future.

​However, it is important to stress that the figure is relatively minor when compared to the already known conventional resource base. In 2012, the US Geological Survey estimated that the world’s ultimately recoverable resources of crude oil and natural gas liquids were more than 3.8 trillion barrels.

​So in terms of resource availability; there remain more than enough resources to meet demand for the foreseeable future.

​In respect to actual production capacity, however, we have undoubtedly seen a transformation in the US with tight oil adding new capacity over the past few years.

​But I think we can all recognize that there remain questions over how sustainable these tight oil developments will be in the long-term. For example, many wells are already experiencing sharp decline rates – in some cases 60% after one year. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2013, we see US tight oil, including NGLs, reaching 4.9 million barrels a day by 2018, before declining in the years following.

​A number of other non-OPEC regions are also expected to see strong supply growth, both in the medium- and long-term – regions such as Brazil and some countries in Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan.

​And of course OPEC continues to invest – to maintain existing capacity and add new production as well. However, like any investments, they will be influenced by various factors – such as policies, the price of oil and overall economic conditions.

​Given all this, it is easy to see why current talk might be of ‘supply abundance’. But we do need to be careful about what this really means.

​Looking at the current situation, we see the market as relatively balanced. And we expect this to be the case for the rest of 2014.

​In terms of OPEC crude production, it is currently close to 30 million barrels a day. This is what is required by the market. The Organization is making sure its consumer’s needs are met.

​In the medium-term, the call remains fairly steady – at around 29-to-30 million barrels a day. It means that OPEC spare capacity is expected to rise, although expectations are that this will be towards comfortable levels.

​But let me add here that this is presuming that everything will stay the same and that there will be no disturbances to supply. History tells us that things rarely stay the same, and the market will have to evolve to ever-changing circumstances in the years ahead.

​Allow me here to recall what happened at the end of 2013.

​In the third and fourth quarters of last year, a number of forecasters were warning of an oil glut. However, this never happened. Cold weather in the US, robust global oil demand, especially in the OECD, along with some supply constraints and a drawdown in stocks in the fourth quarter, meant supply and demand remained relatively balanced.

​Moreover, we also need to keep our eyes on the long-term and where supplies will come from. When we talk about our future, we are not just talking about the next few years. What is clear is that significant OPEC capacity expansion will be required.

​We expect to see the call on OPEC liquids increase by over 10 million barrels a day – from around 37 million barrels a day in 2018 to over 47 million barrels a day by 2035. This is greater than the expected increase in non-OPEC liquids supply over the same period, at just under 9 million barrels a day.

​In recent months, there has also been talk of falling prices. This is obviously difficult to assess. But prices have held fairly steady for the past 18 months or so. It is a level that has been acceptable to both producers and consumers.

​Let me stress here that OPEC does not have target price. Our priority is a stable price – at a level that does not affect global economic growth and, at the same time, that allows producers to receive a reasonable income and invest in supply to meet future demand.

​Talking about the price, we also need to understand the cost of the marginal barrel. Specifically, at what price levels costlier projects become unworkable. It is clear that for some projects – for example, deepwater and Arctic fields, as well as most tight oil and oil sand plays – such a price may not be far below current price levels.

​So we really need to appreciate the delicate balance between prices, the cost of the marginal barrel and future supplies. And this balance is essential in making sure the necessary future investments are made.

​It is important to underscore just what investments we are talking about. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2013 it is estimated that global upstream investment requirements between 2012 and 2035 are $5.2 trillion. Combined with expected requirements in the midstream and refining industries, this number approaches $8 trillion.

​In terms of the upstream, most of the investment will be made in non-OPEC countries. In the medium-term, non-OPEC will invest more than $170 billion each year. OPEC, on the other hand, would need to invest an average of $35-40 billion annually in the coming decade and then over $50 billion annually in the long-term.

​These are huge investments. And of course, the best environment for making these is a stable market.

​To conclude, let me pose a few simple questions:

​Do we have enough resources? Yes we do.

​Is the market over-supplied? No, I don’t believe it is. It is fairly balanced.

​Will both OPEC and non-OPEC be required to increase capacity significantly post-2018? Yes, they will.

​Does this require significant investment? Yes, it does.

​And to deliver the necessary investment I think we can all appreciate that what is of major importance to the market and investors are order and stability.

​This will help us all better understand supply-side developments – in the short-, medium- and long-terms. Given the long-term nature of investments in our industry, they are all connected.

​And although I have only touched upon the supply-side today, we cannot forget about the demand-side, particularly with regard to consuming country policies that might impact demand for oil. This is crucial for investors.

​Of course, challenges and uncertainties remain, and new ones may be just around the corner. There are always unknowns. But we need to make sure we continually advance our understanding of the market and try to put in place the best framework with which to arrive at a future that works for us all.

​Because if there is one thing that can be said with confidence, it is that the future will require supply and investment from all corners of the world.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/207-11-april-2014.html"
"2014-04-08","​Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,
​Good evening.

​It is an honour to be here with you this evening to speak about the global energy outlook, the role for Middle East and North African suppliers in helping secure future global energy demand, as well as some of the challenges the industry faces, including recent geopolitical events.

​Before I begin, however, allow me to say a few words about His Excellency, Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiyah, and the awards that carry his name.

​As many of you will know, my own personal acquaintance with His Excellency goes back many decades. His achievements over the years are ones to be extremely proud of.

​In Qatar, he has been a driving force behind the country’s transformation into one of the world’s major energy hubs.

​At OPEC too, he has played a prominent role in helping the Organization through some difficult times. He has been able to use his charm and humour to bring people together. And he has been able to broker solutions, when there has been discord.

​It is appropriate then, that the Awards given tonight recognize the hard work of other people associated with the industry.

​I will now turn to the first theme of my speech – our global energy future. How we view this has of course shifted over the years, but allow me to give you a brief insight into OPEC’s current views.

​It is clear that world energy demand is set to grow. In OPEC’s 2013 World Oil Outlook, world energy demand rises by 52 per cent over the period between 2010 and 2035.

​Renewables, from wind, solar, small hydro and geothermal, are expected to grow at over seven per cent per year, often as a result of government support and incentives. They certainly hold promise; but globally their share of the energy mix will still be less than 3 per cent by 2035, given their low initial base.

​Both the share of biomass and nuclear remain at steady levels throughout the period 2010-to-2035, at around 9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively.

​So it is fossil fuels that will continue to play the dominant role in meeting demand, although their overall share will fall from 82 to 80 per cent. Throughout most of this period, oil will remain the energy source with the largest share, although its overall share declines from 33 to 27 per cent. Coal’s share remains relatively stable at around 27 per cent. The share of natural gas, however, is expected to rise from 22 to 26 per cent.

​Focusing specifically on oil, our projections see demand increasing by around 20 million barrels a day during the period to 2035. And there will be a big shift in the balance between the OECD area and elsewhere, leading to a steady decline in demand in all OECD regions. It will be developing countries that drive demand, with developing Asia accounting for most of the global increase.

​Here, I should like to highlight an issue that many in the industry and media are talking about: the role of US tight oil in the industry’s future.

​There is no doubt that this is a welcome addition. It adds depth and diversity to the market. But questions remain as how sustainable this will be in the long-term. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook 2013, we see US tight oil, including NGLs, reaching 4.9 million barrels a day by 2018, before declining thereafter.

​All this leads me into the second theme of my speech – the continuing importance of the Middle East and North Africa in helping meet future global oil and energy demand.

​Over the years, the MENA region’s geographic position – and its abundant natural resources – has given it immense strategic importance. The region has been, and remains, central in keeping energy supplies moving to all corners of the world.

​Clearly, the region is now perfectly-positioned for supplying this ever-expanding Asian oil and gas demand centre. And there is no doubt that the region has the resources to continue to play a major role in providing energy supplies, ensuring energy security and contributing to market stability for the foreseeable future.

​The region holds around 865 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves and 86 trillion cubic metres of proven gas reserves. This represents about 58 per cent and 43 per cent of the global totals, respectively. The majority of this is also to be found in OPEC Member Countries.

​In 2012, the region produced over 31 million barrels a day of liquids and over 750 billion cubic metres of natural gas, with a significant part of this provided as export to the world.

​Looking ahead, OPEC’s World Oil Outlook expects that crude and product exports from the MENA region will increase from just over 22 million barrels a day to close to 28 million barrels a day between 2012 and 2035. And, of course, as everyone here this evening knows, gas exports are expected to expand significantly too.

​Taking all this into account, it is clear that the energy market outlook is a favourable one. Demand is set to increase, resources are available, and the MENA region is strategically well-placed to supply the world with energy.

​However, as we all know, no-one can make precise predictions about the future. History tells us that things rarely stay the same, and the market and its stakeholders will have to evolve to ever-changing circumstances in the years ahead.

​There is no doubt that the future path for the industry will be marked with many challenges and uncertainties – the third theme of this evening.

​One specific challenge – and one that I have been asked to talk about– is geopolitics.

​We all know geopolitical events can have an impact on the oil market and raise questions about energy security. Some people might like to try to keep geopolitical issues out of the energy business. But they are often inseparable.

​Over the past few years we have seen many geopolitical events impact the oil market. These include the instability in Iraq, international sanctions on Iran, uprisings in Libya, Egypt and Tunisia, instability in parts of Nigeria, conflict in Syria, and unrest in other countries such as Yemen and Somalia.

​Many of these are still with us in 2014. Of course, in the past month we witnessed unexpected developments between Russia and Ukraine.

​There have been concerns that this crisis could lead to interruptions of Russian oil and gas supplies to Europe. It has also raised some questions as to whether additional supplies could be sourced from the MENA region.

​However, supplies from Russia have kept flowing. And Ukraine remains a key transit country. I hope this continues. It is essential to keep energy flowing – even if political tensions exist. Energy is a global commodity. It drives our industries and businesses; it transports our people and commercial goods; and it is essential to everything we do.

​I should also add that it is important that wise people in these countries work towards resolutions that are satisfactory to all parties. We need to keep the channels of communication open.

​The oil market also needs to be able to have a degree of flexibility – for example, through spare capacity and stocks – to help manage the impact of such challenges. We need to work together and provide the market with some direction – and, hopefully, a certain degree of stability. And in this, OPEC continues to play a vital role.

​Obviously, there are also many other uncertainties for the market to factor in and accommodate.

​For example, the global economy – its health is vital to our energy future. And vice versa.

​The global economic situation currently offers up a mixed picture. We continue to see an ongoing recovery in the OECD. But recent events in Ukraine, as well as a slight slowdown in a number of emerging economies, present challenges.

​Other uncertainties are broad and varied. They include the potential impact of UN climate change negotiations; the role of financial markets and oil market speculation; some consuming country energy policies; a shortage of human capital; advances in technology; rising costs; and severe weather.

​At present, we see the oil market as well-balanced. Yes, there are challenges. But we feel these are currently being absorbed by the market. Supply is meeting demand, and prices have been stable.

​Nonetheless, we need to remain vigilant. In an industry where upstream projects are capital-intensive and long-term in nature, we need to recognize that any uncertainties can put investments in oil exploration and production projects at risk – which, in turn, can threaten future supply.

​Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​This all brings me to the one word that I have uttered on many occasions since I became Secretary General. And that word is ‘stability’.

​Stability is central to everything we do. It is the overarching concern that links us all.

​We need stability – for investments and capacity expansion, to guarantee supply levels are adequate and sufficient, and to enable producers to respond quickly and appropriately in times of unexpected supply constraints.

​We need stability – for investors and producers to realize a fair return from the exploitation of their non-renewable resource.

​We need stability – for consumers to receive reliable and secure supplies.

​We need stability – for the market to react and respond to future unforeseen events.

​We need stability in all its forms. It helps ensure a more balanced market today, which will help provide a balanced market in the future.

​This is something I am sure we can all appreciate.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/208-8-april-2014.html"
"2014-01-27","​Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​I am delighted to be speaking again at Chatham House’s ‘Middle East and North Africa Energy’ conference. It is always a pleasure to be here. I look forward to some interesting and lively discussions.

​This morning I will focus on the question: ‘How can longer-term oil price fluctuations be managed?’ This is obviously an extremely important issue, and one that requires the close attention of both producers and consumers.

​It is easy to appreciate why.

​[SLIDE 2]
​The size, scope, and complexity of the global oil market make it almost unique among physical commodities. Currently more than 90 million barrels of oil are produced and consumed every day. Beyond the scale of this trade, the strategic importance of oil and the crucial role that it plays in the global economy make it a commodity like no other. It is the backbone of the global transportation sector, and is used to develop and produce a vast array of everyday products.

​The price of oil is, of course, a central component to all this. In fact, how oil prices evolve in the future matters to every one of us.

​Whether you are a consumer purchasing a petroleum product at the pump, or the refined products for your airlines, ships and trains; or whether you are a producer looking at oil investments and future prices, a stable and fair oil price is vital.

​High oil prices, for example, are bad for consumers today and lead to situations that are bad for producers tomorrow. And low oil prices are bad for producers today and lead to situations that are bad for consumers tomorrow. 

​Thus, as I have often said, extreme prices – either too high or too low – are not in the interests of either producers or consumers.

​I think it is important to initially stress that past experience has shown us that no one country or institution can set or control prices. 

​However, it is crucial we better understand how the market can help realize a stable and fair oil price and eliminate excessive fluctuations. It means looking at the price from both the short- and long-term perspectives.

​Clearly there is always much focus on the ups and downs of the price on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

​Short-term price fluctuations caused by such issues as geopolitics, supply disruptions, economic developments and weather are natural. They are expected. They are unavoidable. They are absolutely normal.

​However, it is important that we differentiate between such normal fluctuations and those that can be viewed as ‘extreme’.

​[SLIDE 3]
​Over the past decade, we have witnessed the increased financialization of oil markets. Oil has increasingly being treated as an individual asset class by financial investors. Speculative funds flowing into – and out of – the commodity futures markets, have exposed the physical oil market to financial market volatility.

​Since 2005, the total open interest of the NYMEX and ICE futures and options has increased sharply. And what has evolved is a close link between crude oil prices and speculative activity.

​This has meant that some price movements have not been driven by fundamentals or the normal ebbs and flows of the market. They have been driven by market speculation.

​[SLIDE 4]
​This was starkly apparent back in 2008, when crude prices escalated from around $90/b in January to a peak of over $145/b in the middle of the year, before sinking to a low of around $30/b in December.

​It is clear we cannot avoid speculation and volatility altogether. But extreme price fluctuations on this scale are clearly not conducive to the effective functioning of the market, particularly given the long-term nature of investments in our industry.

​In 2013, we generally witnessed prices move in the $100-$110 range. This is a range that is acceptable to producers and consumers alike. Outages, supply disruptions and improved macroeconomic indicators have driven price increases, while lower refinery appetite, production increases and generally higher inventories have weighed on prices.

​However, speculative activities continue to play a role – and have widened both upside and downside price movements.

​That is why it is important to keep a watchful eye over speculative activities, particularly with the relaxed monetary policies seen in a number of major markets today. 

​It is vital for the market to focus on actual market fundamentals, and to continually look to mitigate extreme volatility and excessive speculation. 

​[SLIDE 5]
​Given the long-term nature of our industry, especially when looking at investments, we need to also pay close attention to future years and what can be done to help provide more stability in the long-term price.

​Let me stress here that long-term oil prices and fluctuations cannot really be managed, and that any price forecasts cannot be made with absolute certainty. No-one has the capacity to do this. There are always unknowns.

​What can be done, however, is provide a strong framework for the future. And this begins with the short-term I have just mentioned. 

​We need to continually work towards a balanced market between supply and demand – a market with adequate and flexible spare capacity and storage for both crude oil and refined products to counter any short-term turbulence.

​Looking at the market today, we believe fundamentals remain balanced. There is more than enough supply to meet demand. Spare capacity and stocks are at healthy levels. And prices are at comfortable levels for both producers and consumers.

​Stability and a balanced market today will be helpful in providing stability and a balanced market in the future.

​[SLIDE 6]
​In addition, there are evidently a number of other factors that can help to deliver a balanced market, with stable and fair prices, in the years ahead. This is not an exhaustive list; but I hope to provide some key points.

​It is important that we look to provide rational and impartial supply and demand forecasts.

​We need to continually strive for more reliable and transparent data, to help alleviate uncertainty and volatility. This can be done through dialogue between all stakeholders, and through initiatives such as the Joint Organisations Data Initiative – or, as it is better known, JODI.

​For oil producers, it is also critical to have a better understanding of demand side developments, particularly policies that might discriminate against oil. At the heart of this is security of demand. This is just as important to producers, as security of supply is to consumers.

​We need to remember that all investments require certain conditions. These can obviously vary, but in general, the focus for producers is on stability. Its absence can lead to investment uncertainty, and, in turn, future market instability.

​To put it simply: producers do not want to waste precious financial resources now on infrastructure that might not be needed in the future. At the same time, however, if timely and adequate investments are not made, then future consumer needs might not be met.

​And of course, both under- or over-investment can lead to future price fluctuations, with potential knock-on consequences. In this regard, and specifically in terms of lower prices, we need to think about the cost of the marginal barrel.

​Given the complexities of the oil market, it is difficult to establish a single number that represents the marginal cost. But it is evident that the cost of some oil sands projects, tight oil plays, deepwater and Arctic fields are the most likely to represent the marginal cost.

​This raises the question: at what price levels would some of these projects become unworkable? It is clear that for some projects it may not be far below current price levels.

​It is in no-one’s interest to have an industry where investments are ‘on, off, on off,’ every time prices witness extreme fluctuations. It is wildly changing prices that can most affect investments – and do most damage to both producers and consumers.

​Let me stress here that OPEC Members are committed to invest, and to ensure that consumers receive oil when they need it.

​These investments are important as we expect to see the call on OPEC liquids increase by over 10 million barrels a day by 2035 – which is greater than the expected increase in non-OPEC supply over the same period, at just under 9 million barrels a day.

​However, as with any investments, they will obviously be influenced by various factors, such as the price of oil, as well as the overall economic situation and policies.

​I should also like to highlight one other issue that is often overlooked when we talk about prices. This is the amount of taxes paid by end-consumers at the pump. In many cases, such as in a number of EU countries and Japan, the amount of taxes paid is more than 50 per cent of the overall cost. 

​It is thus clear that the taxation of oil products has the potential to significantly impact end-prices and accentuate price fluctuations for consumers.

​[SLIDE 7]
​To conclude, it would be wrong for anyone to provide any guarantees to eliminate long-term price fluctuations. All we can do is look at our forecasts and try to put the best framework in place to arrive at a future that works for us all.

​This requires producers and consumers to work together with innovative thinking, collaboration and swift action, where and when appropriate, on key issues. And it means further evolving data transparency and clarity and making sure that price extremes are kept in check.

​Given the long-term nature of our industry and the need for clarity and predictability – I would like to leave you with three words – ones that have been central to my speech today: ‘stability, stability and stability’.

​Stability for investments and expansion to flourish;
​Stability for economies around the world to grow;
​And stability for producers, allowing them a fair return from the exploitation of their non-renewable natural resources

​And, of course, long-term price stability is a fundamental element to all of this.

"2013-11-25","​Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It gives me great pleasure to be here at the 10th Jubilee Vienna Economic Forum. I would like to thank the organizers for the invitation to speak to you today.

​In its ten years of existence, the Vienna Economic Forum has become an effective vehicle for promoting economic development and investment opportunities in South-Eastern Europe. I hope the Forum continues to go from strength-to-strength.

​Turning to the theme of this session; the focus is on our visions about the economy. This certainly offers us a great amount of scope, particularly in view of the economic challenges of the past few years. But since I am here representing OPEC, I will stick to offering some views on the global economy, and how we see it impacting the oil market today, and in the years ahead.

​In general, we are optimistic about global economic growth for 2014. Our forecast is for growth of 3.5 per cent, higher than the 2.9 per cent expected for 2013. Nevertheless, on a regional basis, there is a mixed picture.

​Here in the EU, the European Commission said earlier this month that the European economy had reached a “turning point” and there were “signs of hope”. There are certainly signs of a recovery in some countries – in the UK, for example. However, there remain challenges in terms of high unemployment and high debt levels, particularly in a number of Euro-zone countries. So, the economic recovery remains fragile; but we do see the Euro-zone returning to positive growth in 2014.

​In the US, there are some positive economic indicators with some stronger numbers for manufacturing and services, as well as rising exports. But consumer spending was somewhat subdued in the third quarter and there are some headwinds. It is also hoped that the US government does not see a repeat of the recent debt stand-off. Overall, however, we anticipate stronger US growth in 2014, at 2.5 per cent, compared to the 1.6 per cent expected this year.

​In Japan, the country continues to enjoy government-led support measures and a growth revival. But there remain challenges for the government in its ongoing recovery and fiscal consolidation efforts.

​In China, even though the country’s economic growth for 2013 slipped from a predicted 8 per cent at the start of the year to 7.6 per cent today, the numbers are still clearly positive. 

​India, too, has seen its predicted growth lowered. It now stands at 5 per cent for this year. We hope that this slowdown is just a short-term issue and not a long-term trend.

​And in developing countries, we have generally seen some concerns regarding the impact on their economies of an expected reduction in US monetary stimulus. This could affect the flows of investment to developing countries and, accordingly, reduce demand for their exports. However, as a whole, we expect growth to remain fairly robust in the developing world.

​Looking ahead, we could say we view the global economy in 2014 with ‘cautious optimism’. And this is also how we view the outlook for oil demand.

​World demand growth is forecast to increase by 900,000 barrels a day this year and then 1 million barrels a day in 2014. Non-OECD countries are projected to lead oil demand growth again in 2014, with an increase of 1.2 million barrels a day. OECD consumption, however, continues to decline with a drop of 200,000 barrels a day, although this is a lower rate than in previous years.

​In terms of supply, there is evidently enough to meet demand in 2014, just as there has been in 2013. In 2014, non-OPEC supply is expected to rise by 1.2 million barrels a day. This increase comes from North America, Brazil, as well as additions from some other producers. 

​In terms of OPEC crude production, currently it is just over 30 million barrels a day. The Organization continues to make sure the needs of its consumers are met. Moreover, spare capacity remains at comfortable levels. And we see these healthy levels remaining for the foreseeable future.

​From the perspective of stocks, we also see fairly robust numbers. Stock levels in the OECD remain relatively healthy and forward demand cover is currently 58.6 days, above the five-year average. In addition, there has also been a steady build up in commercial and strategic petroleum reserve stocks in non-OECD countries, such as China and India. 

​Looking towards the long-term, in our recently published 2013 World Oil Outlook, we assume global economic growth will return to healthy levels, around 3.5 per cent on average per annum. This leads to expectations that oil demand will increase by close to 20 million barrels a day, to reach 108.5 million barrels a day by 2035. Transportation, especially in developing countries, is key to this increase in demand.

​Let me stress that there are clearly enough resources to meet this demand growth. And this supply comes from a wide variety of liquids.

​For OPEC, we are committed to continue investing – and to ensure that consumers receive their oil when they need it. This, in turn, supports oil market stability and sound world economic growth.

​According to the latest list of upstream projects in the OPEC Secretariat’s database, Member Countries are undertaking or planning around 120 development projects during the five-year period between 2013 and 2017. This translates into average annual upstream investment requirements of around 35 to 40 billion dollars.

​However, it is important to remain vigilant in the years ahead. There remain many uncertainties and challenges for the industry. As I have already emphasized, there are the uncertain prospects for the global economy; but there are other challenges, too. 

​For example, there is still concern about the role of financial markets and the impact of excessive speculation. There are the ongoing UN climate change negotiations with their possible impact on the energy sector still unclear. There are discriminatory energy policies in a number of consuming countries. There is the impact of geopolitics. There are advances in technology and their impacts on exploration and production. And there are also rising industry costs.

​Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

​In today’s increasingly complex and interdependent world, a stable economy is vital – for governments, for industry, for energy producers and consumers, for each and every one of us. As this session underlines, it is the ‘motor of development’.

​This means that everybody has a responsibility to support a return to balanced and sustainable economic growth. It is something we should all strive for.

​With energy very much driving the heartbeat of our world, OPEC takes pride in working hard to support stability. We remain optimistic about the future – while also realizing there will still be many uncertainties and challenges to overcome in the years ahead.

​Thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/210-25-november-2013.html"
"2013-11-22","​Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

​Good morning,

​On behalf of OPEC and its Member Countries, I would like to offer my sincere appreciation to the people and Government of Poland for hosting this conference, and for their excellent arrangements and warm hospitality.

​Climate change is a concern for us all. Thus, negotiations to develop an agreement by 2015 and raise the level of ambitions for the pre-2020 period are extremely important.

​We have made some progress. But there is much left to be done.

​Our common objective is the full, effective and sustained implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its success, however, requires transparent, inclusive, comprehensive and country-driven negotiations that take into account the interests of all Parties.

​It is important that already agreed commitments are met. And it is crucial that Parties that have agreed to Kyoto’s second commitment period proceed quickly with ratification, while other developed country Parties should make comparable commitments too.

​Another key building block towards success is raising the level of ambitions for all Parties for the period up to 2020 — in mitigation and adaptation, as well as in the means of implementation.

​During the last two years, the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (or ADP) contributed to a fruitful exchange of views on the scope, structure and design of the 2015 agreement. As it now enters a crucial phase leading to a negotiating draft, it is important to recall that the ADP’s work and its outcome should both be “under the Convention”.

​It means it should be consistent with — and adhere to — all the principles and provisions of the Convention, including the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’. And it should be comprehensive, in particular, with regard to mitigation, adaptation, financial resources, technology transfer and capacity-building.

​In addition, social and economic development and poverty eradication remain overriding priorities for developing countries, the fundamental differentiation that exists in the Convention between developed and developing countries should not be blurred. This must be reflected in the 2015 agreement. Furthermore, the work of the ADP should address the potential adverse economic and social impacts of response measures on developing countries.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​It is imperative that the provisions contained in the Framework Convention and the Kyoto Protocol should be fully implemented — and included throughout the ADP process.

​This is needed to minimize any adverse impacts and assist OPEC Member Countries and other developing countries to adapt — by diversifying their economies, strengthening their resilience, and enhancing increased investment and technology transfer.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Environmental protection and sustainable development continue to be of great importance to our Member Countries. Voluntary initiatives in these areas are being carried out every day. These include investing in carbon capture and storage, reducing gas flaring, developing hybrid solar-gas power stations and solar-powered desalination units, and producing cleaner petroleum products.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that OPEC’s Member Countries are committed to achieving an effective and comprehensive outcome based on full consensus — and that is in full compliance with the UNFCCC.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/211-22-november-2013.html"
"2013-10-28","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Good morning to you all.

Let me start by thanking the organizers of this International Energy Week for inviting me to address you today. The event plays an important role in promoting energy dialogue among all stakeholders.

As we all know, dialogue is essential if the industry is to meet the many challenges facing it in the future. And today, I hope to be able to give you a brief insight into how OPEC sees the energy future.

[SLIDE 2]
What is clear is that world energy demand is set to grow. In OPEC's World Oil Outlook, world energy demand rises by 52 per cent over the period between 2010 and 2035.

Renewables, from wind, solar, small hydro and geothermal, are expected to grow at over seven per cent per year, often as a result of government support and incentives. They certainly hold promise; but globally their share of the energy mix will still be less than three per cent by 2035, given their low initial base.

Both the share of biomass and nuclear remain at steady levels throughout the period 2010-to-2035, at around nine per cent and just below six per cent respectively.

It is clear that fossil fuels will continue to play the dominant role in meeting demand, although their overall share will fall from 82 to 80 per cent. Throughout most of this period, oil will remain the energy source with the largest share, although its overall share declines from 33 to 27 per cent. Coal’s share remains relatively stable at around 27 per cent. The share of natural gas, however, is expected to rise from 22 to 26 per cent.

[SLIDE 3]
Focusing specifically on oil, our projections see demand increasing by around 20 million barrels a day during the period to 2035.

There will be a big shift in the balance between the OECD area and elsewhere, leading to a steady decline in demand in all OECD regions. It will be developing countries that drive demand, with developing Asia accounting for most of the global increase.

The transportation sector will be the main source of growth, continuing a trend seen since 1980. This will be mainly in road transportation, and the increases will come only from non-OECD countries.

And of course this will also mean significant expansion in the downstream. For example, in OPEC’s World Oil Outlook, it is expected that there will be around 20 million barrels a day of additional crude distillation capacity required in the period to 2035. The majority of this is in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.

[SLIDE 4]
The industry is capable of meeting the big demand increases, through its huge resource base. The US Geological Survey estimates the world’s ultimately recoverable resources of crude oil and natural gas liquids at more than 3.8 trillion barrels.

Moreover, there are the recent tight oil developments in North America. This is welcome news – it adds depth to global supply, aids market stability and provides further proof that the world is not running out of oil. However, questions remain over how sustainable this will be in the long term.

[SLIDE 5]
Taking all this into account, it is clear that the market outlook is a favourable one for the oil industry. And it is up to all of us to ensure that this works out in practice.

What the oil market needs most of all, as it seeks to meet the rising levels of demand with the necessary investments, are order and stability. This means a clear vision of the way ahead, together with a cooperative and harmonious approach from all the leading players.

This vision must be a broad one, linking market stability with other key global issues, notably sustainable development and the environment.

However, as we all know, the future path for the industry is marked with uncertainties. These can have significant impacts on investment in future capacity to meet the rising levels of demand.

When planning for the future in the oil industry, whether this is five, ten or even 20 years ahead, we need a clear idea of where the market is heading. Otherwise we may end up wasting huge amounts of capital on unused plant and equipment. Or else we could find that there is not enough new capacity in place to meet the rising levels of demand. Whichever way it is, this could be highly disruptive for the industry and for the energy community as a whole.

Let me stress here that OPEC is committed to invest, and to ensure that consumers receive their oil when they need it. This, in turn, supports oil market stability and sound world economic growth.

According to the latest list of upstream projects in the OPEC Secretariat’s database, Member Countries are undertaking or planning around 120 development projects during the five-year period between 2013 and 2017. This translates into average annual upstream investment requirements of around $35-$40 billion.

[SLIDE 6]
Looking at the market today, we believe fundamentals remain balanced. There is more than enough supply to meet demand. And prices are at comfortable levels for both producers and consumers.

Nevertheless, it is evident that there are a number of uncertainties that the industry needs to address in the years ahead.

Of course, there are the prospects for the global economy, particularly in the short and medium terms. While there have been positive signs here recently, particularly in OECD regions, downside risks remain.

Nevertheless, the outlook for 2014 is better than for 2013. In OPEC’s latest Monthly Oil Market Report, we see global GDP of 2.9 per cent in 2013, and this increases to 3.5 per cent the following year.

There is still concern about the role of financial markets, even after the passage of new laws on financial sector regulation.

Then there is the tragic series of events at Fukushima. More than two and a half years later, the debate continues in many countries about the extent of nuclear power’s future role in global energy supply.

There are also the ongoing UN climate change negotiations, the next round of which will begin soon in Warsaw. These have been going on for two decades and yet their final outcome and impact on the energy sector are still unclear.

Other causes of uncertainty for the oil industry include: discriminatory energy policies; geopolitics; advances in technology; rising costs; and severe weather.

[SLIDE 7]
Before finishing, I should like to highlight that next week we shall be releasing our latest set of energy market scenarios. These will appear in the 2013 issue of the OPEC World Oil Outlook. I hope they will make a useful contribution to the industry in terms of a better understanding of some of the challenges, as well as the opportunities, we face today.

My discussion on some of the uncertainties has highlighted how difficult it is drawing up such scenarios each year. But it is vital that we all continue to consider and discuss our possible energy futures. Dialogue between all industry stakeholders is essential.

The industry needs as much information and analysis as it can get about the oil and energy outlooks, if it is to prosper in the years and decades ahead.

"2013-10-21","​Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
​Good morning.

​It is a pleasure to be here in Oman and to be in the company of His Excellency Mohammed bin Hamad Al Rumhy, Minister of Oil and Gas of Oman, as well as my dear friend, His Excellency Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiyah.

​I would also like to acknowledge Gulf Intelligence for the invitation to speak at this Oman Energy Forum.

​The main focus of this speech will be the current oil market situation. However, I understand that there will be a question and answer session following this short speech and I am happy to try and answer any questions you may have on the medium- and long-terms, as well as the current situation. I look forward to our deliberations and discussions.

​Allow me initially to say a few words on Oman.

​Over the years, Oman has been an important part of the international oil and energy markets. In terms of oil, its current production stands at around 900,000 barrels a day and the country has plans to invest even more to help boost reserves and capacity further.

​It is proving an excellent example of how you can get much more from natural resources by using technology for enhanced oil recovery.

​Moreover, Oman has also seen increasing investments in the downstream, as well as in storage, trading and shipping, and it has major plans to expand its natural gas sector.

​The country has decided to take some risks and invest considerable resources to expand its oil and gas capabilities. This is something OPEC welcomes. It is clear that Oman is now reaping the rewards from recent developments.

​Given its location at the crossroads of the energy corridor that connects Africa, the Middle East and Asia, there is no doubt that Oman will remain an important player in the global energy market.

​Turning to the current oil market, let me stress that over the past few years the market has not been directed solely by the fundamentals of supply, demand and stocks, as it has been in the past. There are many other factors at play, such as the role of oil as an asset class, speculation, the futures market and spot prices, and of course the current economic environment.

​In looking at this past year, while some might suggest that it has been less volatile than those in the recent past, it has remained a testing time for the global oil industry.

​In 2013, we have continued to see a number of uncertainties and challenges. These include the future of the global economy as it continues its recovery, geopolitical events and their potential and actual implications on the oil market, as well as some supply issues, particularly in the North Africa and the Middle East.

​Despite these issues and others, however, there has been no shortage of oil in the market. There has been enough supply to meet demand. And we believe market fundamentals remain balanced today.

​Nevertheless, as we approach the end of 2013 and head into next year we need to remain vigilant. There remain many concerns for the market to digest, and act upon.

​The economy remains the major worry, particularly in the short- and medium-term.

​In the US, we continue to see some economic recovery, with improvements in the labour market, the housing market and stronger numbers for manufacturing and services, as well as improved consumer confidence. And I am sure we are all happy to see the US Government step back from the brink of defaulting on its debt. We anticipate seeing stronger US growth in 2014, at 2.5%, than the 1.6% expected this year.

​In Japan, while the country continues to enjoy government-led support measures, there remain challenges for the government in its ongoing recovery and fiscal consolidation efforts.

​The Euro-zone continues to be a region of mixed messages. There has been some improvement in output and sentiment, but the labour market situation remains a major challenge, particularly in places like Greece, Spain, Portugal and others. However, as the economy is coming from very low levels of output, there is some expectation of a slight recovery later this year and into 2014.

​In China, recent data suggests that the economy has slowed a little. The country’s economic growth for 2013 has slipped from a predicted 8 per cent at the start of the year, to 7.6 per cent today. Although I should stress that this figure is still clearly positive. India too has seen its predicted growth lowered, and this now stands at 5 per cent for this year. We hope that this slowdown is just a short-term issue, and not a long-term trend.

​And in developing countries, in general, we have seen some concerns regarding the impact on their economies of the expectation of a reduced US monetary stimulus, which will affect the inflows of investment and accordingly reduce demand for their exports. However, we expect growth to remain fairly robust in the developing world.

​There is clearly much to keep policymakers engaged as countries and regions look to stimulate and support economic recovery.

​Overall the outlook for 2014 is better than for 2013. In OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report we see global GDP of 2.9 per cent in 2013, but this increases to 3.5 per cent the following year.

​In terms of other challenges, I should reiterate the importance of eliminating excessive speculation.

​I am sure everyone here can appreciate that we cannot avoid speculation and volatility altogether. It is a part of the market. However, it is essential that we look to mitigate extreme volatility and excessive speculation, which are detrimental.

​Trading continues to be made on the perception of a supply shortage, rather than evidence of any actual or impending shortfall.

​Even though this year – in terms of prices – we have generally witnessed prices move in the $100-$110 range; a range that is acceptable to producers and consumers alike. It is important that prices do not witness extremes – neither too high nor too low.

​On the supply side, there have been some disruptions in a number of producing countries in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as in the North Sea.

​These developments, however, have had minimal impact on the market. Supply has been able to meet demand. In addition, supply continues to increase with non-OPEC expected to rise by 1.1 million barrels a day in 2013, and 1.2 million barrels a day in 2014.

​Non-OPEC supply increases are led by the US and its rising tight oil production. Let me stress here that this is a welcome development. It adds depth to global supply, aids market stability and provides further proof to consumers that the world is not running out of oil. We hear very little talk of ‘peak oil’ today.

​However, while recent developments in the US have been transformative for its energy industry, we need to see how sustainable this type of production is in the longer term. For instance, tight oil wells in the first year witness steep decline rates. It means that operators need to ‘drill, drill, drill’ just to maintain production.

​In terms of OPEC crude production, it is currently just over 30 million barrels a day. The Organization is making sure its consumer’s needs are met.

​At the same time, spare capacity remains at comfortable levels. And we see these comfortable levels remaining for the foreseeable future.

​From the perspective of stocks, we also see fairly robust numbers. Stock levels in the OECD remain relatively healthy, and there has also been a steady build up in commercial and strategic petroleum reserve stocks in non-OECD regions, such as China and India. And forward demand cover is currently 58.6 days, which is above the five-year average.

​Given that world demand growth is forecast to increase by 800,000 barrels a day this year and 1 million barrels a day in 2014, there is clearly enough supply to meet rising demand.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Allow me to reiterate some key messages concerning the current oil market situation.

​There has been, and there remains, more than enough supply to meet demand. We also see this as the case for the rest of 2013 and into 2014.

​Stock levels and OPEC spare capacity continue to support the future supply and demand outlook.

​And the main uncertainty remains global economic growth, with the Euro-zone continuing to be the main area of concern.

​Thank you for your attention. And I look forward to our follow-up discussions.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/213-21-october-2013.html"
"2013-10-07","Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to thank His Excellency Al-Shamali, Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Oil for Kuwait for the invitation to speak at this conference. It always gives me great pleasure to come back to Kuwait – one of the founding Members of OPEC.

[SLIDE 2]
The three core themes of this session – collaboration, people and technology – have been at the forefront of the oil and gas industry since its very beginning. And these three elements are clearly entwined.

Technology and people have combined to continually transform our industry, playing a fundamental role in supporting the efficient production of hydrocarbons.

Over the years, technological advancements have helped people to push the limits of the industry. For example:

To put it simply: collaboration, people and technology have allowed the industry to survive and thrive, despite the many challenges it has faced.

The history of Kuwait’s oil industry is an excellent example. Back in February 1938, oil was discovered at the Burgan field, with commercial oil production beginning in 1946. It was a great find for Kuwait, but very few would have predicted that this field would still be pumping today. Burgan turned into a ‘giant’ oil field and it remains central to Kuwait’s oil industry.

In Burgan’s long history, people and technology have combined – to tap into the reservoir, expand its recoverable resource base and apply improved recovery techniques, so that more of the oil in place can be produced.

There are similar stories to be found across the world, with people working together to continually push the boundaries of technology.

[SLIDE 3]
Technological advancements have enabled the industry to increase the estimates of the amount of oil and gas that can be found, and what can be recovered. Improvements in the quantity and quality of information about different geological structures has enhanced the likelihood of finding oil and gas, and extended the reach of the industry into harsher and more remote locations in ‘frontier areas’.

Of course, when talking of fossil fuels we need to recognize that they are non-renewable resources, so peak supply will arrive one day. But at present, this day is being pushed further and further into the future.

For oil, estimates from the US Geological Survey of ultimately recoverable resources have more than doubled since the early 1980s, from just 1.7 trillion barrels to over 3.8 trillion barrels. Cumulative oil production has been less than a third of this.

And when looking at recovery rates, these have increased from less than 10 per cent of oil in place in the early history of the industry, to in excess of 70 per cent in some fields today.

In terms of drilling, we have progressed from drilling tens of metres to many kilometres below the surface, both vertically and horizontally. And the industry as a whole has evolved from basic geological sciences to reservoir simulators, state-of-the-art IT, 3D views of deep and complex horizons in the subsurface, large offshore drill ships and huge data mining activities to optimize performance.

From the downstream perspective, the development of the fluid catalytic cracking process for upgrading heavy crude components has allowed the industry to produce increasingly lighter products and much larger volumes of transportation fuels. And desulphurization technologies have enabled the industry to reduce the environmental impact of sulphur emissions.

The list of new technologies could go on and on.

And looking to the future, the industry can be expected to see technologies shift perceptions and prospects once more. For example, through carbon capture and storage, further advancements in enhanced oil recovery and the development of new oil-based materials for various industry sectors.

[SLIDE 4]
It is clear that technology, people and collaboration will remain central to the industry’s future. And we need to see the future as an ever evolving one, where standing still is not an option. This is easy to appreciate when we look at some important global trends.

First, although the global economy today remains fragile, we can expect to see it rebound.

Second, world population is predicted to reach 8.6 billion by 2035, an increase of over 1.5 billion from today’s level, with the expansion overwhelmingly in developing countries and urban areas.

And thirdly, we need to remember that around 1.4 billion people still have no access to electricity and some 2.7 billion continue to rely on biomass for their basic needs. There is much potential for social progress and making improvements in people’s living conditions – by providing light, power and mobility. For example, in developing countries, car ownership averages around 40 cars per 1,000 inhabitants, far lower than in OECD countries, where it is almost 600 per 1,000 inhabitants.

[SLIDE 5]
It all points to the fact that energy demand will rise. It is expected to increase by over 50 per cent by 2035 and all energies are set to witness growth.

However, it will be fossil fuels that remain dominant in meeting energy demand for the foreseeable future. They currently account for 82 per cent of global energy demand, and will still make up over 80 per cent by 2035.

Of all fossil fuels, natural gas is expected to witness the fastest growth rate, at close to 2.5 per cent annually. And its overall share in the fuel mix rises gradually.

For oil, although its overall fuel share falls between 2010 and 2035, demand still increases by more than 20 million barrels a day over this period, reaching almost 110 million barrels a day by 2035.

Clearly with this expansion comes the need for more technological innovation, additional human resources and greater collaboration, so that we may produce the required volumes in a secure, safe and environmentally-sound way.

[SLIDE 6]
However, we need to recognize that one of the three key elements of this session is now a cause for some concern. Globally there is a shortage of young people entering the industry. It is vital that this is rectified.

To do this, we need to understand the reasons behind this global shortage.

There is the current global economic climate, which is obviously impacting job prospects in many industries across the world.

There is the large-scale downsizing that led to a lack of recruitment into the energy sector during the 1980s and 1990s. At that time, many universities cut back drastically on students in energy-related programmes because the industry did not need graduates in high numbers.

In recent years, there has also been a dramatic expansion in the services industry and ‘emerging knowledge’ economies, all of which has led to fierce competition for talent.

And there is also a sizeable section of the industry’s workforce that are now rapidly approaching retirement, particularly those that entered the industry in the 1970s. This was an issue specifically highlighted in a recent study by the European Union and OPEC, titled ‘Potential Manpower Bottlenecks in the Oil & Gas Industry’.

Meeting the human resource challenge will not happen overnight. We must look long-term. The industry is one characterized by long-lead times, and often long payback periods, which means it must view employees as long-term assets.

[SLIDE 7]
Before concluding – and given that I am speaking here on behalf of OPEC – allow me to say a few words on the current market situation.

We see the market is balanced. There has been, and there remains, enough supply to meet demand. We also see this as the case for the rest of 2013 and hopefully for 2014, with stock levels and OPEC spare capacity continuing to support the supply and demand outlook.

The market is stable, something OPEC continually strives for.

And when thinking of stability it brings me back to the three elements of this session: collaboration, people and technology. All are key factors in helping to bring about stability and ensuring the world has enough supply to meet demand.

Without new people, without new technologies and without collaboration the industry would go backwards. These three entwined issues are essential to the short- and long-term market stability that we all desire.

[SLIDE 8]
Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/214-7-october-2013.html"
"2013-09-12","Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good morning.

I would like to thank Korea’s Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy for the invitation to speak at this Fifth Asian Ministerial Roundtable. It is a pleasure to be here in Seoul.

I understand the theme of today’s session is to place Asia into perspective in terms of economic growth and energy. There is clearly much we can focus on and I hope that my comments will provide a humble contribution to this debate.

There have been many predictions about Asia in the 21st century – that it will increasingly become the world’s economic centre; and that developments in the region will have profound implications for people, businesses and nations everywhere.

In fact, all of this is already happening. The world’s economic and energy landscape is changing – and Asia is at the very heart of this.

We can see this when we look at demographic trends, economic growth rates, and energy demand and supply since the start of this century, as well as projections for the future.

[SLIDE 2]
In terms of population, the Asian region accounted for around 50 per cent of the world’s increase from 2000 to 2012 and is expected to account for close to 40 per cent of the growth from now until 2035. The region has a young, dynamic and expanding population.

Looking at economic growth, the region has outpaced others in the period since 2000. While the OECD has seen an average growth rate of 1.8 per cent between 2000 and 2012, Asia and Oceania – excluding China – has seen 5.5 per cent growth. China alone over this period is at 9.8 per cent. And India is at 7.6 per cent.

The region has been the most dynamic in terms of trade, with exports and imports both witnessing significant growth. This trend will continue. Within a few years, Asia will not only be the world’s largest producer of goods and services, but the largest consumer of them as well.

[SLIDE 3]
When we look at oil and energy demand, the numbers reflect a similar message. Of all world regions, Asia has seen the greatest energy demand increase since 2000.

In terms of oil, demand in the Americas and Europe since 2000 has fallen by 2.3 per cent and 12.4 per cent, respectively, whereas Asian oil demand has increased by 41.5 per cent. This equates to an addition of over 8 million barrels a day, with Asian oil demand currently standing at more than 29 million barrels a day.

Looking ahead, global energy demand is expected to expand more than 50 per cent by 2035, with Asia again seeing the largest increase. For example, oil demand is expected to increase from just below 90 million barrels a day in 2013 to around 109 million barrels a day by 2035, with around 88 per cent of this increase in Asia.

On the flip side, however, Asian oil supply has only witnessed growth of 1 million barrels a day since 2000, to stand at close to 8 million barrels a day.

It means that oil demand in the region today exceeds local supply by over 20 million barrels a day. And this number is expected to grow due to further domestic consumption growth.

[SLIDE 4]
There is no doubt that Asia will continue to be at the centre of medium- and long-term changes that are shifting the economic balance of power and altering the global energy map.

There have been suggestions that Asia’s per capita income could rise six-fold in purchasing power parity terms to reach European levels by 2050. This would nearly double Asia’s share of global GDP to over 50 per cent.

In addition there is huge potential to ease the plight of many of those billions in Asia who continue to suffer from energy poverty.

Looking outwards, Asia’s continued growth will have further implications for global trade, interdependence and cooperation, as well as a greater role for the region in global affairs.

This growing power and influence also means the region will increasingly be looked upon to take a lead, in areas such as education, technology and research, and build closer ties, particularly with other emerging economies in Africa and Latin America.

This is certainly true in the energy sector as countries in Asia look for overseas resources to meet their increasing domestic demand.

For example, we are already seeing a number of Asian oil companies engaging in overseas acquisitions and projects to help secure supplies, with many of these in other developing countries and regions.

Moreover, it will mean that over the next 20 years or so Asia will see energy and oil imports increase from almost all regions – but mainly from the Middle East, where many OPEC Members are located. And these countries are equipped and able to meet this increase.

Let me stress here for those worried about there not being enough resources to meet demand. This is not the case. There are more than enough resources to meet expected demand for the foreseeable future.

[SLIDE 5]
When talking of energy supply, I think it is also important to highlight tight oil. It is a development much discussed in global energy circles and one that obviously has implications for Asia and global oil trade.

I would like to make three points:

First, it is clear that tight oil developments in the US are freeing up some global supplies, many of which are now finding their way to meet Asia’s increasing demand.

Second, while some have viewed these new supplies as a threat to other producers, OPEC welcomes these developments. They support the global supply outlook and provide further proof to consumers that the world is not running out of oil.

And third, while recent developments in the US have been transformative for its energy industry, we need to see how sustainable this type of production is in the longer term. For instance, the industry is already seeing tight oil fields reach a production plateau after only a year or so, and then witness a steep decline rate. There have been reports that shale wells can drop off by more than 60 per cent within the first year.

Here in Asia, there is already much discussion about the potential for shale in the region. This leads me to a number of questions: Can developments in the US be replicated elsewhere? Or is the US a unique case? Let us wait and see.

[SLIDE 6]
Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Asia will continue to be the engine of economic growth and energy demand in the decades ahead. Its ascent is already one of the defining characteristics of the 21st century.

And from OPEC’s perspective, let me finish with two important points.

First, that our Member Countries remain committed to making sure our customers receive secure and regular oil supplies to meet their demand needs.

And second, we are also committed to broadening areas of cooperation, through events like this Roundtable. It is evident today that the importance of dialogue between the world’s energy stakeholders — especially in terms of bringing together producers and consumers to discuss the various global and interdependent issues we face — has never been greater.

"2013-07-12","​Mr. President, Excellencies, Heads of State of Member Countries of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, Ministers and Ambassadors, distinguished delegates, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen.

​On behalf of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, it is a great honour to be here at the Second Heads of State and Government of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum.

​OPEC welcomed the formation of the GECF and recognizes its important role in the global gas market and its significance to its Members – a number of whom are also Members of OPEC.

​The GECF is focused on establishing a platform for the exchange of analysis and information in areas such as natural gas production, gas supply and demand balances, gas transportation and technologies, and strengthening cooperation and coordination among its Members and external parties.

​The goal is helping to deliver gas market stability for the benefit of both producers and consumers. This is something OPEC fully appreciates given its position in the oil market. 

​The significance of this stability is amplified when we look at the expected future roles of both oil and gas.

​Looking ahead, it is clear that world energy demand is set to grow. In OPEC’s most recent World Oil Outlook, world energy demand increases by 54 per cent over the period 2010-to-2035.

​While renewables, biofuels and nuclear will play an important part in a diverse future energy mix, it will be fossil fuels that remain dominant in meeting energy demand for the foreseeable future. They currently account for 87 per cent of global energy demand, and will still make up 82 per cent by 2035.

​Of all fossil fuels, natural gas is expected to witness the fastest growth rate, at close to 2.5 per cent annually. And its overall share in the fuel mix rises from 23 per cent today to 26 per cent by 2035. 

​For oil, although its overall fuel share falls from 35 per cent to just over 27 per cent between 2010 and 2035, demand still increases by more than 20 million barrels a day over this period.

​Combined, natural gas and oil will still meet well over 50 per cent of the world’s energy needs by 2035.

​That is not to say, however, that the future will be straightforward. As well as opportunities, there will also be challenges and some of these are shared by both oil and gas.

​For example, challenges related to the environment, human resources and technology and investments. There is much our industries can learn from each other. 

​Your Excellencies.

​Permit me to also share with you the principles that the Heads of OPEC States agreed upon during their most recent Summit held in Riyadh, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This included among others:

​• Stability in global energy markets;
​• Energy for sustainable development; and,
​• Energy and environment.

​They recognized the importance of reliable and affordable energy supplies in ensuring global prosperity for all. This reaffirms our commitment to the principles and objectives in the Organization’s Statute, the Solemn Declarations from the Summits in Algiers in 1975 and Caracas in 2000, as well as our Long-Term Strategy.

​Before I finish, allow me to thank the hosts of this important summit, Russia: a principal player in both oil and gas markets, particularly given its location between Europe and Asia. In OPEC we value the dialogue we continue to have with Russia.

​With that, I would like to wish the GECF all the best in meeting its mission and objectives. I hope the organization continues to go from strength-to-strength.

​Excellencies, thank you for your attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/216-12-july-2013.html"
"2013-04-04","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Good morning.

​I would like to begin by thanking the organizers of this event for inviting me to the 14th International Oil Summit.

​I have been asked to share with you - and my colleagues here in the IEA and IEF - our views on the global energy future.

​Let me begin by taking you back to the past. Energy has positively impacted the lives of billions over the centuries, especially after the discovery and utilization of fossil fuels. It has provided heat, light and mobility, and been central to the development of the industrial civilization as we know it today.

​And it will be just as important to our future economic and social progress. Therefore we need all sources of energy - old and new - and it is easy to understand why.

​Firstly, world population is expected to reach around 9 billion by 2040, an increase of over 1.8 billion from today's level.

​Secondly, the global economy will rebound in the longer term. Of course, I cannot stand here and say the current economic outlook is rosy, but we should be optimistic about the future.

​Thirdly, passenger car ownership rates are expected to more than double by 2035, from around 900 million today to close 1.8 billion by 2035.

​And fourthly, with around three billion people living on less than two dollars 50 cents per day, 1.4 billion people having no access to electricity and some 2.7 billion relying on biomass for their basic needs, there is huge potential for socio-economic development.

​All this underlines that world energy demand is set to grow. In OPEC's most recent World Oil Outlook, world energy demand in 2035 increases by 54 per cent over the period 2010-to-2035.

​With this figure in mind, there is clearly room for all energies. There are great prospects for the industry. Nonetheless, it is vital that we fully understand which energies will form the core of our future? And which energies will play a more complementary role?

​I should add that none of us can make accurate predictions. We don't have crystal balls! Over time, opinions can shift, new realities can set in, and of course, we can expect many challenges and uncertainties on the path ahead.

​However, there is no doubt that we can determine some 'basic realities' about the shape of our energy future.

​Renewables, mainly wind, solar, small hydro and geothermal, are expected to grow at around 8 per cent per year, often as a result of government support and incentives. Renewables certainly hold promise, but globally its share in the energy mix will be at 3.5 per cent by 2035, given its low initial base.

​Biofuels are expected to expand their role - supported by direct and indirect government subsidies - but not at levels once assumed. For first-generation biofuels, there remain serious concerns over the competition between food and fuel, as well as due to impacts on biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions and water resources. Last year, here in the European Union a 5 per cent cap was placed on the amount of biofuels in the EU's 2020 transport mix over concerns about using food-based crops for fuel. Second and third generation biofuels can overcome some of these concerns, but they are still far from being available for commercial use.

​For nuclear, there remain challenges such as high upfront costs, long-lead times, operational safety, decommissioning, waste management and public acceptance. Despite these, nuclear is expected to see some expansion, although its overall share drops slightly to six per cent by 2035.

​In terms of fossil fuels, they currently account for 87 per cent of global energy demand and will still make up 82 per cent by 2035.

​Of all fossil fuels, natural gas is expected to witness the fastest growth rate, at close to 2.5 per cent annually. And its overall share in the fuel mix rises from 23 per cent today to 26 per cent by 2035. The increase will be driven primarily by the expansion of natural gas in the power generation sector. 

​Whether gas experiences a 'golden age' remains to be seen. It will clearly be dependent on price, profitability and sustainability.

​Coal also witnesses some growth, but over the forecast period its overall share falls slightly and by 2035 it will be at a similar level to oil. Its future prospects will be impacted by the extent to which costs are attached to carbon emissions, as well as from competition with other sources of electricity generation, notably gas.

​For oil, although its overall fuel share falls from 35 per cent to just over 27 per cent between 2010 and 2035, demand still increases by more than 20 million barrels a day over this period. It will eventually reach over 107 million barrels a day by 2035.

​The reality is that fossil fuels will remain dominant in meeting energy demand for the foreseeable future.

​We also have the resources to meet future demand. But obviously we need to turn these resources into supply. This requires technology and investment. And, of course, in this regard, we need to think about the price.

​The key question is: what price is required to make each energy economically viable?

​I am sure we all appreciate that every energy, and every investment project, has a break-even cost associated with it. Whether producing conventional oil and gas, coal, Canadian oil sands, ultra-deep offshore oil, renewables or biofuels there is an associated marginal cost.

​So what is the potential impact of lower prices?

​If prices fall below certain levels, then many investors will find their developments no longer viable. 

​And if low prices lead to energy investments across the world being put on hold or cancelled altogether, then there is the potential to sow the seeds for extreme high oil prices in the future, if a lack of investment leads to supply failing to keep up with future demand increases. This has happened in the past.

​It underscores the importance of a stable and fair price for all - one that is satisfactory for both producers and consumers and allows the energy industry and the global economy to grow. It matters to every one of us.

​Extreme prices - either too high or too low - not only affect producers, but also consumers, and the global economy as a whole.

​Before I finish, allow me to touch upon one issue that have been asked about on numerous occasions over the past year: tight oil and shale gas.

​We welcome energy diversity and an expanded energy mix. Shale gas and tight oil are positive additions. And in the US they are certainly having an impact.

​However, they too have an associated marginal cost; one that is higher than for conventional fossil fuels. We have already seen a slowdown in US shale gas drilling as natural gas prices fell.

​And in addition, we need to be careful in estimating their potential. There have been reports that shale wells can drop off by as much as 60-90% within the first year.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Of course, our energy future will also be shaped by other issues and challenges such as those related to the global economy, the environment and human resources, but these are for another day.

​To sum up, the 'basic realities' I have touched upon today are:

​The future will be dominated by fossil fuels. Renewables and other alternatives will play a role, but they will be supportive.

​It is important to recognize the different break-even price levels for the various energies. We believe current price levels are supportive of the energy future we portray, and will not harm the global economy.

​And it is clear the future is a shared one. There is no country, region or continent that can act alone. It is about inter-dependence, not in-dependence.

​While none of us can plot the exact path of our energy future, I am sure we all recognize these 'basic realities' and what has been central to much of what I have talked about: the importance of stability. This will always be paramount to delivering a sustainable energy future.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/217-4-april-2013.html"
"2013-01-28","​Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen: Good morning.

​It gives me great pleasure to speak again at this prestigious conference. I would like to thank the organizers Chatham House for the invitation.

​[Slide 2] When looking at the overall theme of this year's conference - 'Adapting to new resource realities' - a number of central issues quickly came to mind.

​The first is that we appear to have moved on from the peak oil debate the industry was having only a few years ago. There are plenty of available resources, both conventional and non-conventional. Of course, peak oil will come one day, but not for the foreseeable future.

​Second is the growing role of unconventional oil and gas, particularly tight oil and shale gas in the US. It is evidently changing the US energy landscape, although questions remain as to how sustainable this growth will be in the long-term. And we need to recognize that shale developments outside of the US remain in the very early development stages. The general consensus is that it will be difficult for others to replicate how the US has developed its shale resources.

​Third is the continuing and expanding nature of our energy interdependence. In the recent past, some have talked about a decoupling of countries or regions, but this is a myth. We are all inter-linked - what happens from an energy perspective in one place, can have knock-on implications elsewhere.

​And fourth - although for many this may not be viewed as a 'new reality' - is the fact that despite there being much talk of alternatives, it is fossil fuels that will remain central to the world's energy mix for the coming decades.

​[Slide 3] This last point can be viewed in OPEC's latest World Oil Outlook, published in November last year. In it energy demand increases by 54 per cent over the period 2010-to-2035, and fossil fuels, which currently account for 87 per cent of energy demand, will still make up 82 per cent of the global total by 2035. While oil does see a percentage fall over this period, from 35 per cent in 2010 to 27 per cent in 2035, demand still increases by more than 20 million barrels a day. It reaches over 107 million barrels a day by 2035.

​However, while resource availability to meet this demand increase is clearly not an issue - as a number of the new realities I have outlined emphasize - we need to remember that availability is nothing without deliverability. And for deliverability we need stability. It is essential that all stakeholders work to ensure market stability.

​[Slide 4] Of course, when talking about stability, one of the key elements of this is the price, which brings me to a question posed for this session: what factors lie behind the fear of oil price weakness? 

​I am sure we all have a number of thoughts about this: a slowdown in the global economy; supply outstripping demand; expanding oil inventories; and increasing spare capacity. We can, however, also look in the other direction and ask what factors might lead to possible price rises. Geopolitics may come to mind, a stronger than expected global economic recovery, as well as investments and supply not materializing as fast as expected.

​At present, we believe the market is well-balanced, and as such these 'fears' should not be over blown.

​This is an important point. And leads me to ask a follow up question: how are these 'fears' perceived by some in the market?

​[Slide 5] These 'fears' are a driving force behind speculative investment flows and price volatility that remain a significant part of the market, as they have been since 2005.

​Excessive speculation is one of the major challenges facing the oil industry. Over the past six or seven years, extreme price fluctuations have been accompanied by massive inflows and outflows of investments.

​For example, last year saw a significant increase in the number of open interest contracts on NYMEX and the ICE. Towards the end of last year, it exceeded 4 million contracts, or 4 billion barrels. This is more than forty times greater than actual daily oil demand!

​It is important to stress, however, that the 20-to-30% change in prices we saw in 2012 occurred despite the market being well-supplied, with OECD crude stocks above their five-year average, and with OPEC spare capacity at healthy levels. And looking ahead to 2013, the market is expected to remain well-supplied to meet the expected demand growth.

​It all points to a balanced market for supply and demand. Yet significant price volatility has been apparent.

​Speculative investment flows can distort the price of crude. Let me add, however, that the challenge is not about eliminating speculation and expectation altogether. The underlying issue is excessive speculation and extreme volatility. This is what needs to be tackled.

​This is not only about safeguarding OPEC's interests and revenues, but also about safeguarding the future oil market. Uncertainty breeds indecision.

​[Slide 6] Looking ahead, at OPEC we do not envisage a price collapse, but it is important we understand some of the potential effects of falling prices.

​Of course, OPEC Member Countries will receive less revenue. The possible implications of this are a question posed for this session.

​It is important to note that petroleum revenue plays a central role in the economic and social development of our Member Countries. In fact, over 75 per cent of OPEC's total export revenue came from this source in 2011 and they remain central to the provision of healthcare, education and basic economic infrastructure for their young and expanding populations.

​In recent years we have also seen the budgetary requirements of many oil producing countries expand, as domestic needs increase. And, of course, any reduction in petroleum revenues will have an impact on some of these countries. Just as any government and country would be impacted by a reduction in their revenues or tax take.

​I should add that some OPEC Member Countries recognize the importance of reducing their dependency on oil exports. I believe it is becoming increasingly crucial for oil producers who still depend heavily on oil revenues to look to other sources of income. Diversity, in this regard, is vital.

​When talking about OPEC's petroleum revenues, I feel it is important to put these into context. There have been a number of sources that have cited recent revenue figures as some kind of 'extreme'. Overall, OPEC Member Countries saw petroleum export revenues of close to $1.1 trillion in 2011.

​However, the fact is that oil consuming countries have been making more money from the sale of oil products than have oil producing countries.

​For example, over the 2007-11 period OPEC Member Countries received close to $4.2 trillion in revenues generated from crude oil sales. But over the same timeframe, OECD countries received over $5.5 trillion from oil taxes. 

​In fact, here in the UK, the government earned on average about 1.8 times more from oil taxes in 2011 than what OPEC Member Countries themselves obtained from the sale of their oil.

​Additionally, it is worth pointing out that the money earned by OECD countries from oil taxes is pure income for their national governments. The revenues earned by OPEC Member Countries from crude oil sales, on the other hand, must also be used in part to cover the high costs of exploration, production and transportation.

​For example, according to the latest list of upstream projects in the OPEC Secretariat's database, Member Countries are undertaking or planning around 116 development projects during the five-year period 2012-2016. It is estimated, that total OPEC liquids capacity will rise by 5 million barrels a day over this period. And these developments correspond to an estimated investment of about $270 billion.

​Investment decisions and plans, however, will obviously be influenced by the price of oil, as well as such factors as the global economic situation and policies.

​[Slide 7] Here, I should stress that low prices and reduced revenues will not only impact OPEC Member Countries.

​It will mean less recycling of OPEC Member Country income globally.

​And it has the potential to impact the entire oil market if low prices lead to investments across the world being put on hold or cancelled altogether. In fact, this is true for all energies.

​Every energy, and every investment project, has a break-even cost associated with it. Whether producing Canadian oil sands, US tight oil or ultra-deep offshore, there is an associated marginal cost. If prices fall below a certain level, then the industry will find some of these developments are no longer viable. And it is clear that lower oil prices would also impact the development of other projects such as renewables.

​Such outcomes have the potential to sow the seeds for extreme high oil prices in the future, if a lack of investment leads to supply failing to keep up with future demand increases. This has happened in the past.

​It underscores the importance of a stable and fair price for all - one that is satisfactory for both producers and consumers and allows our industry and the global economy to grow. This is what OPEC continually strives for.

​This is a highly significant issue. How oil prices may evolve in the future is an extremely important question for the world economy, for the oil industry and, of course OPEC Member Countries, whose economies, as I mentioned, are still highly dependent on oil export revenues. In truth, it matters to every one of us.

​Extreme prices - either too high or too low - not only affect producers, but also consumers, and the global economy as a whole.

​[Slide 8] Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​Energy resources are sufficient. Fossil fuels remain the main source of our energy future. And we live in an ever more interdependent world. Three simple realities.

​And in looking at these, if I had to leave one simple word each for OPEC producers, in fact all oil producers, for consumers and for the market as a whole, it would be 'stability', 'stability', 'stability'.

​Stability for producers to allow them to earn a fair return from the exploitation of their exhaustible natural resources;

​Stability for economies around the world so that they may grow; and

​Stability for investments and expansion to flourish.

​It is the best means of safeguarding all of our interests.

"2012-12-07","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

OPEC is proud and honoured that the UN Climate Change Conference is hosted by one of its Member Countries, namely the State of Qatar.

This is a great example of the positive and constructive role that OPEC’s Member Countries have played in addressing the issue of climate change.

Climate change is a threat to sustainable development and concerns all of us.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the foundation of global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Its principles and provisions should remain the cornerstone of climate change negotiations, in particular the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and of equity, and with economic development and poverty eradication the overriding priorities of developing countries.

Important progress has been made in the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action negotiations since their establishment at COP13 in Bali. They are now being terminated here in Qatar. However, we need to ensure that all the issues under the Bali Action Plan are completely resolved.

It is also crucial that the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol begins in 2013 in an effective manner, with ambitious limitation or reduction objectives for emissions. Developed countries, given their historical responsibility, should take the lead in mitigation and adaptation efforts. This includes using their extensive financial and technological capabilities to help developing countries with their nationally-appropriate mitigation actions and adaptation activities.

Important negotiations have begun under the Ad-Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform (ADP) for Enhanced Action. These negotiations should be transparent, country-led and inclusive, and based upon the principles and provisions of the UNFCCC.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

OPEC Members Countries are developing countries, whose economies are heavily dependent on petroleum export revenue. They contribute to satisfying world energy needs and, thus, to the health of the global economy.

They are doubly vulnerable: to the effects of climate change, and to the adverse impacts of response measures. In this regard, the provisions contained in the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol should be fully implemented – including through the ADP process – to minimize these adverse impacts and to assist OPEC Member Countries to adapt by diversifying their economies through increased investment and technology transfer.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

OPEC Member Countries are making huge efforts to protect the environment, such as through gas flaring reduction, supplying cleaner petroleum products, investing in carbon capture and storage, developing hybrid solar-natural gas power stations and solar desalination units. They also invest in research and development for cleaner energy.

OPEC Member Countries are also very active in alleviating energy poverty. In this regard, the OPEC Fund for International Development committed $1 billion to facilitate access to modern energy services in poor countries.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Our Member Countries are committed to reaching a comprehensive, balanced outcome to the negotiations based on a full consensus. This outcome should be ‘win-win’ in nature and recognize the diverse interests of all Parties to the Convention.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/219-7-december-2012.html"
"2012-09-28","Ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to thank Wintershall for the invitation to speak to you. It is a pleasure to be here today.

The title of my talk is 'OPEC's View on the Global Energy Scene'. Given that energy is such an important, as well as complex issue, there is obviously much we can cover. I will begin, however, by underscoring the importance of energy to our future, just as it has been to our past.

[Slide 2]
Energy has been central to a great deal of humanity's progress over the centuries. It has positively impacted the lives of billions. And energy will be just as important to our future economic and social progress. It is easy to understand why.

Firstly, world population is expected to reach more than 8.6 billion by 2035, an increase of over 1.6 billion from today's level. To put this into perspective, the world will add more than a combined India and the United States to its population in just over 20 years.

Secondly, the global economy will rebound in the longer term. Of course, I cannot stand here and say the current economic outlook is rosy. But as we have learned from the past, downturns do not go on forever.

And thirdly, with around three billion people living on less than two dollars 50 cents per day, 1.4 billion people having no access to electricity and some 2.7 billion relying on biomass for their basic needs, there is huge potential for socio-economic development.

This latter point also highlights the fact that unfortunately today, billions of people continue to suffer from energy poverty. Let me stress; it is vital that every single one of us in the world has access to modern energy services.

[Slide 3]
What all this underlines is that world energy demand is set to grow. In OPEC's most recent World Oil Outlook, world energy demand in 2035 is expected to be more than 50% higher than it was in 2010.

In a nutshell, this is the industry's key challenge; and not only for producers and investors, but consumers too.

To meet this challenge, we need a stable and predictable market. We need to focus on the efficient and sustainable development of all energies. We need to appreciate just what each energy source can offer to this future. And we need to allow producers and investors to make sure future energy demand can be met.

In OPEC's World Oil Outlook 2011, all energies witness growth, although overall shares shift over time.

Fossil fuels - which currently account for 87% of the world's energy supply - will still contribute 82% by 2035. Oil will retain the largest share for most of the period to 2035, although its overall share falls from 34% to 28%. It will remain central to growth in many areas of the global economy, especially the transportation sector. Coal's share remains similar to today, at around 29%, whereas gas increases from 23% to 25%.

In terms of non-fossil fuels, renewable energy grows fast. But as it starts from a low base, its share will still be only 3% by 2035. Hydropower will increase only a little, to 3% by 2035. Nuclear power will also witness some expansion, although prospects have been affected by events in Fukushima. It is seen as having only a 6% share in 2035.

Some may ask, can we meet this demand? I have no doubt that we can.

At this point, given that I am here representing OPEC, allow me to focus specifically on the oil industry.

[Slide 4]
In OPEC's World Oil Outlook 2011, demand for oil is expected to increase by close to 23 million barrels a day over the period 2010-2035, reaching almost 110 million barrels a day by 2035. This is driven mainly by developing Asia, which is home to 80% of the oil demand growth over this period. In contrast, the OECD region actually witnesses a fall.

To meet this oil demand growth, resources are clearly sufficient. Improved technology and enhanced recovery have over the years increased the resource base to levels well above past expectations. And today we are seeing significant new resources and supplies.

Recent estimates from the US Geological Survey of ultimately recoverable resources are around 3,500 billion barrels. To put this into some context, cumulative oil production has been less than a third of this.

Moreover, we can expect further advances to extend the reach of the industry - helping to reduce costs, unlock additional resources and increase supplies.

So when some people talk about peak oil, let me say, it will not be any time soon. Of course, one day it will come, but that day is certainly not yet.

To push this day further and further into the future we need to continually develop technologies in all spheres of the oil industry, and employ high-calibre people to utilize these to explore for oil in new frontier areas, which are often in remoter, harsher and deeper locations. Above all, however, you need management who has the guts to take risks, because this is the name of the game in the oil industry.

Speaking of guts; let me say a few words about Wintershall and its operations in my home country, Libya.

Wintershall has had a local exploration and production presence in Libya since 1958, but until the 1980s it was only a very small producer in the country. Most people at that time knew little of the company's operations, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s the company's management changed its thinking and policy. They decided to take some risks, and invest considerable resources into new exploration and developments. It proved to be a successful decision as it led to significant new discoveries and production. As of 2011, the company had drilled over 150 wells and become one of the largest oil producers in the country.

It is an example of how investment can yield significant new resources and supply, and position a company as a significant producer.

[Slide 5]
Of course, this type of risk taking only tells part of the story. We need to remember that all investments require certain conditions. These obviously vary, but in general the focus for producers is on stability.

At the heart of this is security of demand. This is just as important to producers, as security of supply is to consumers. Energy security should be viewed as a full circle.

For producers, it is critical to have a better understanding of demand side developments, particularly policies that discriminate against oil. If not, it can lead to investment uncertainty, and in turn, future market instability.

To put it simply: producers do not want to waste precious financial resources on infrastructure that might not be needed. At the same time, however, if timely and adequate investments are not made, then future consumer needs might not be met.

This is brought home when looking at the investments OPEC Member Countries are making today. For the five-year period 2012-2016, there are currently 116 upstream projects in OPEC's portfolio. Should all projects be realized, this could translate into an investment figure of close to $280 billion. These are major investments; none of which our Member Countries want to see as wasted.

There are, of course, many other challenges and uncertainties too.

[Slide 6]
Evidently the one most talked about today is the global economy.

The Euro-zone continues to struggle with such issues as sovereign debt, the banking crisis and high unemployment. The Euro-zone's economy is expected to contract this year.

The US is one of the more resilient developed economies, but the most recent indicators offer a somewhat mixed picture.

In China, while economic growth remains around 8%, recent data suggests the economy has slowed. However, it is unclear whether this is a long-term trend, or just a short-term issue.

And in developing countries, in general, there are concerns as to whether problems in the OECD will spill over into their economies, particularly in terms of reduced demand for their exports.

There is also the human resource challenge, the importance of which I have already touched upon. Looking ahead, the industry needs to make sure it is attractive to prospective graduates, keep talented people and transfer knowledge to the next generation. They will be the ones that push the industry's boundaries in the years ahead.

There is also the challenge of protecting the environment, both locally and globally.

In this regard, it will be essential to promote the early development and deployment of cleaner energy technologies. And given the continuing dominance of fossil fuels in the energy mix, we need to look at options that allow the continued use of fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained world. In this regard, Carbon Capture & Storage is a proven one that can be cost effective, and has the potential to contribute significantly to emissions reductions.

[Slide 7]
Before I finish, I feel it is appropriate to provide a little background on the current oil market.

For this year 2012, OPEC forecasts world demand to grow by 900,000 b/d. In 2013, growth is 800,000 b/d. Non-OPEC supply is expected to increase by 700,000 b/d this year, and 900,000 b/d next. And demand for OPEC crude in 2012 is projected to average 29.9 mb/d, and 29.5 mb/d in 2013.

In addition, OPEC spare capacity remains at relatively comfortable levels and total commercial stock levels are healthy.

It is clear the market is currently well-supplied. Supply and demand fundamentals point to a stable market. We see no shortages.

As I have already highlighted, however, the global economic situation remains a major uncertainty in these short-term forecasts.

From a price perspective, while there have been both ups and downs in 2012, this volatility has not been because of market fundamentals. Speculation has been behind much of the price volatility.

[Slide 8]
To conclude, when looking to the future we need clarity to understand each other's viewpoints. We need to develop a common understanding and positive dialogue. And we need to find the right balance in handling the uncertainties and challenges before us in a manner that allows us to achieve the overall objectives of energy for economic growth and social progress.

This is true for producers and consumers; NOCs, IOCs and service companies; in fact, all stakeholders.

A committed, cooperative and coordinated approach aimed at fostering market stability in both the short- and long-term is something OPEC places much value on.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/220-28-september-2012.html"
"2012-09-19","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Good afternoon.

I would like to thank the Chairman for his introduction, and the European Mineral Resources Conference for the invitation to speak to you today in such an esteemed seat of learning. It is a pleasure to be here.

For the mineral and energy resources sector, the Montan University, here in Leoben, is an important and leading academic institution. Year-on-year it produces skilled professionals that are essential to running our evolving – and ever-expanding – industries. I would like to congratulate the university on producing high-calibre people who pursue careers in the modern energy and mining industries.

The importance of this cannot be over-stated.

Our industries are heavily people-intensive; from exploration to extraction and production, from transportation through to final end-products.

The resources from our industries are used in thousands of every-day consumer products, as well as high-tech products. The world, as we know it, would not function without them.

Our industries have helped drive economic and social development around the world. And looking ahead, the utilization of raw materials and energy will be central for our economies, society’s future, and in particular, those billions who continue to suffer from poverty.

[SLIDE 2]
My speech today will spotlight on just one part of this mineral resources mix: oil. It is of course the main emphasis of the organization I represent, OPEC, and in addition, it is the industry that I have been involved in for my entire career.

I have been asked to focus on the future development of the oil market, specifically what it brings, and what it means. There are many facets to this, but I think I should initially outline what OPEC sees in terms of growth, from both the oil and overall energy perspectives.

Over the past 50 years or so, the world’s demand for energy has expanded dramatically; from just over 55 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 1960 to around 233 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2010. This demand growth was met by a variety of energy sources, but the majority has come from fossil fuels.

This expansion is set to continue, with OPEC’s most recent World Oil Outlook published in November last year, projecting a figure of close to 360 million barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2035. It means that energy demand increases by around 50% by 2035.

All energies witness growth, with fossil fuels – which currently account for 87% of the world’s energy supply – still contributing 82% in 2035. Oil will retain the largest share for most of the period to 2035, although its overall share falls from 34% to 28%. It will remain central to growth in many areas of the global economy, especially the transportation sector. Coal’s share remains similar to today, at around 29%, whereas gas increases from 23% to 25%.

In terms of non-fossil fuels, renewable energy grows fast. But as it starts from a low base, its share will still be only 3% by 2035. Hydropower will increase only a little – to 3% by 2035. Nuclear power will also witness some expansion, although prospects have been affected by last year’s events in Fukushima. It is seen as having only a 6% share in 2035.

From the perspective of oil, this translates into demand increasing by close to 23 million barrels a day over the period 2010-to-2035. It reaches almost 110 million barrels a day by 2035.

[SLIDE 3]
The question asked by some is: can this oil demand increase actually be met? I am in no doubt that it can. There are two main reasons for this.

The first concerns the availability of oil. While some voices continue to talk about impending peak oil – just as others have done in the past – the industry continues to push the boundaries in terms of what can be found, and what can be recovered. Of course peak oil supply will arrive one day – it is a non-renewable resource after all – but at present, this day is being pushed further and further into the future.

Technology and people continue to transform the oil industry, in terms of the way resources are identified, developed and produced. Technology is bringing out more resource from the tight grip of rocks.

Over the years, the improved quantity and quality of information available about different geological structures has enhanced the likelihood of finding oil, and extended the reach of surveyors, geologists and explorers into remoter and harsher locations in the ‘frontier areas’.

Petroleum science has evolved from basic geology to supercomputer-based calculations, reservoir simulators and 3D views of deep and complex horizons in the subsurface. In terms of drilling, we have progressed from drilling tens of metres to many kilometres below the surface, both vertically and horizontally.

New technologies have also helped transform resources once thought unconventional into conventional ones. We should remember that only forty years ago, all offshore oil was considered unconventional. Today, this portion of total global oil supply accounts for 30%.

Today, the quantity of recoverable oil resources is higher than ever. Estimates from the US Geological Survey of ultimately recoverable resources have more than doubled since the early 1980s, from just 1.7 trillion barrels to around 3.5 trillion barrels. Cumulative oil production has been less than a third of this.

And the second reason comes from looking to the past.

The required production capacity in the coming decades – including compensating for natural decline in oil fields – is nothing new for the industry. This level of increase has been achieved in the past. Producers have seen total oil supply increase from around 22 million barrels a day in 1960 to over 87 million barrels a day in 2011, again driven by technological progress.

So resource availability is not an issue, and the industry has always been able to deliver the supply needed to meet demand.

This, however, only tells half the story. We need to also look at the question: what will the industry need to succeed in the future?

[SLIDE 4]
This takes me back to my introduction: the importance of the human resource. To put it simply: with the industry continuing to expand, and the need to increasingly tap into resources in more remote and challenging areas, the industry needs more people.

Today, however, it is increasingly being recognized that there is shortage of human resources entering the industry. It is essential that this is rectified.

It leads me to the question: what are the core human resource challenges that the oil industry has to deal with today?

There is the large scale downsizing that led to a lack of recruitment into the energy sector during the 1980s and 1990s. At this time many universities also cut back drastically on the number of people taking energy disciplines. It proved a damaging experience. In fact, the industry is still paying the price.

In recent years, there has been a dramatic expansion in the service and emerging knowledge economies, which has led to fierce competition for talent.

And there is also a sizeable section of the industry’s workforce, particularly the large numbers that entered the industry in the 1970s, that are now approaching retirement.

Earlier this year, Schlumberger, in its 2011 Oil & Gas Human Resources Benchmark Survey, said that pressures on the industry's technical workforce threaten the timely completion of projects. In the survey, up to 70% of national oil companies and 60% of major international oil companies acknowledged project delays due to staffing difficulties.

It is apparent that there are no real short-term solutions. Meeting the human resource challenge will not happen overnight. The industry must look long-term. The industry is one characterized by long lead times, and often long payback periods, which means it must view employees as long-term assets.

The key is making the industry more appealing; to make it accepted as an inclusive and forward looking workplace. The industry needs to be sure it is well presented as a prime employment choice; a high-tech and diverse sector with great prospects.

In fact, this needs to begin before actual employment – with education and training, at establishments like the one here in Leoben. It is important for the industry to be significantly involved in developing and supporting new graduates and its potential workforce at an early stage. The focus is on further developing a better relationship between prospective employees, universities and the industry.

Our industry is nothing without a well-trained workforce. It is the lifeblood for developing and deploying the techniques and technologies that continue to push our industries forward.

Here, let me add a few words to any students in the audience who are undertaking or thinking of a career in the petroleum industry.

Oil has been fundamental to a great deal of humanity’s progress over the centuries. Whether we are driving a car, flying an aeroplane, playing music, using a toothbrush, wearing glasses or shoes, or even camping in a tent, we are using products made with crude oil. It is an industry that can change the way we do things.

Looking ahead, there are great challenges and opportunities, in both the short- and long-terms. There are tremendous prospects for eager young graduates to get out in the field. It is a creative, dynamic and expanding sector, with the scope to push the boundaries of where technology can take us. I know if I was starting out once more, I would again see the industry as an attractive career choice.

[SLIDE 5]
Before I finish, I would like to also offer a few comments about the current oil market. It is something I am sure is expected from an OPEC Secretary General! And we should also remember that we cannot view the short- and long-terms in isolation. They are interconnected.

What is evident is the market is currently well-supplied. There is no shortage of oil anywhere in the world. And this is expected to continue.

OPEC forecasts global oil demand is to grow by 900,000 barrels a day in 2012, and 800,000 b/d in 2013. And there is more than enough new supply to meet this increase. Non-OPEC supply is expected to increase by 700,000 b/d this year, and 900,000 b/d next year.

Moreover, OPEC spare capacity remains at comfortable levels and total commercial stock levels remain healthy

The global economic situation remains a major uncertainty. It will be important to monitor this carefully in the coming weeks and months, but risks currently appear skewed to the downside.

In terms of prices, I should like to stress that while the price has witnessed both ups and downs in 2012, this volatility has not been because of market fundamentals. Speculation has been behind much of the price volatility.

Let me add here that while OPEC does not have a price target, it recognizes the importance of a stable price. This is essential for both producers and consumers. It needs to be a level that does not affect global economic growth. And at the same time; a level that allows producers to receive a decent income and to invest to meet future demand.

[SLIDE 6]
Ladies and gentlemen,

They say a conference audience normally remembers three key things from a speech. With this in mind, allow me to provide you with what I feel are the three key ‘long-term’ takeaways:

Firstly, the world will need more energy. It means, the oil and energy industries are set to expand significantly.
Secondly, there are plenty of available resources to meet future demand growth. It is not a question of availability, but one of deliverability.
And thirdly, the industry needs more people. It is essential to attract graduates to undertake energy disciplines, and make sure the industry has skilled, well-trained and happy employees.

With that, I would like to wish you all a successful conference.

[SLIDE 7]
Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/221-19-september-2012.html"
"2012-06-22","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Rio+20 is extremely important for individuals, for nations and, of course, for the entire planet.

We welcome the outcome document and we value the positive spirit and the inclusive process that led to this achievement.

In implementing past commitments, many successes have been registered and progress was made. But there are still many gaps in implementation.

It is indeed important that the Rio+20 outcome document carries forward what has been agreed upon in previous summits on sustainable development and reinforce implementation.

The future should ensure the balanced integration of economic development, social development, and environmental protection, as these are the interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars of sustainable development.

The principles and provisions contained in the 1992 Rio Declaration should remain the cornerstone of sustainable development. In particular, the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity, the right to development, the sovereign right of States to exploit their natural resources, as well as the UN principle of permanent sovereignty of States over their natural resources.

The process to define sustainable development goals should also assess implementation gaps in previously agreed goals and commitments, particularly the Millennium Development Goals, and should aim to address these gaps. It is important that previous commitments made, are adhered to.

It is also essential to remember that sustainable development is country-led and country-driven. No one-size-fits-all model exists.

For many developing countries, the primary focus is on alleviating poverty. And in this regard, a catalyst in helping alleviate poverty is access to affordable modern energy services. These have positively impacted the lives of billions in terms of providing light, power and mobility; we now need to make sure they positively impact the lives of billions of others, especially the 1.4 billion people that lack access to electricity and the 2.7 billion that rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating. Energy poverty needs the urgent and critical attention of world leaders, so as to alleviate this blight on humankind in the years and decades ahead.

What this underlines is the importance of all types of energy for economic and social development. While some are new and emerging from a low base, other types of energy have contributed for centuries to satisfy human energy needs and are projected to continue to play an important role in the foreseeable future. It is thus essential to promote all cleaner energy technologies, including carbon capture and storage.

My Member Countries are already making significant efforts in deploying these technologies, as well as to diversify their portfolio of energies, in areas such as hydro, solar and wind. We recognize that renewable energy has a part to play in our future. And, of course, it is also crucial we continue to strive to use energy ever-more efficiently. In this regard, technology transfer to developing countries and capacity building must constitute essential means of implementation.

Looking ahead, we need to work together. We must continue the process of inclusivity, achieving outcomes by consensus, with transparent country-led negotiation, building upon the principles, provisions and commitments already made.

"2012-06-13","Excellency Dr Heinz Fischer,
The President of the Federal Republic of Austria,

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome to the Hofburg Palace in Vienna for the Fifth OPEC International Seminar, whose theme is 'Petroleum: Fuelling Prosperity, Supporting Sustainability'.

Vienna has been the home of our Secretariat now for nearly half a century. During this time, the world oil industry has changed beyond recognition. Without any doubt, it has changed for the better. In OPEC, we feel privileged to have been part of this process and the benefits it has brought to mankind as a whole.

The challenges we face today as oil-producing, developing countries have evolved and diversified over the years.

However, we remain committed to the original objectives dating from our first meeting in Baghdad in September 1960. These relate to market order and stability for the present and the future. They are outlined in the OPEC Statute as follows:

Since then, we have adopted important new challenges as they have arisen. At OPEC's Third Summit in Riyadh in 2007, our Heads of State and Government defined three guiding themes to cover future actions by our Member Countries and the Organization as a whole. These are:

In addition, OPEC has been at the forefront of the huge advances in dialogue and cooperation that have helped bind the industry together in today's fast-moving, high-tech, global market.

As is the case with any Organization like ours, it is necessary to sit back and review the current situation from time to time, as well as reflect upon the new challenges. And when this is done by a group of leading stakeholders and experts with a shared commitment to progress in the industry and the advancement of mankind generally, then all the better.

This is why we have been holding this series of OPEC International Seminars since 2001.

Over the next one and half days at this year's seminar, various important topical issues will come under scrutiny. These include the international oil market, the global energy scene, the world economy, the environment, sustainable development and technology. We shall also be assessing the present and future outlooks in these areas.

And who better to discuss these issues than the men and women who have left an indelible mark on the industry? These include Ministers from our own Member Countries and other oil-producing countries, heads of intergovernmental organizations, chief executives of national and international oil companies, industry analysts, academics and the media. Their wisdom and insights will enrich our discussions during the seminar.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

At this point, I should like to thank all those who have been involved in organising the event, under the overall direction of His Excellency Abdalla Salem El-Badri, the Secretary General.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In just three years' time, we shall be celebrating half a century of our excellent relationship with the Federal Republic and with the City of Vienna. Since we moved our Secretariat to this fine international city in September 1965, this relationship has gone from strength to strength, to our mutual benefit. And we look forward to building upon this in the future, with the continuing friendship and cooperation of our hosts.

It now gives me great pleasure to welcome to the platform His Excellency Dr Heinz Fischer, the President of the Federal Republic of Austria, to deliver his welcoming address.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/223-13-june-2012.html"
"2012-06-13","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Good morning.

On behalf of the OPEC Secretariat, I would like to welcome you to the 5th OPEC International Seminar. It gives me great pleasure to see lots of familiar faces, as well as so many new ones. I hope you all enjoy the event.

[Slide 2]
When looking at the global energy scene it is important to consider where we are today, where we might be going, and how we might get there. For OPEC, this is laid out every year in its World Oil Outlook.

The most recent version of this was published at the end of 2011. In its Reference Case, energy demand increases by more than 50% between 2010 and 2035. And over the same timeframe, world population is expected to expand from 6.9 billion to almost 8.6 billion. 

All energies witness growth, although overall shares shift over time.

Fossil fuels - which currently account for 87% of the world's energy supply - will still contribute 82% by 2035. Oil will retain the largest share for most of the period to 2035, although its overall share falls from 34% to 28%. It will remain central to growth in many areas of the global economy, especially the transportation sector. Coal's share remains similar to today, at around 29%, whereas gas increases from 23% to 25%.

In terms of non-fossil fuels, renewable energy grows fast. But as it starts from a low base, its share will still be only 3% by 2035. Hydropower will increase only a little - to 3% by 2035. Nuclear power will also witness some expansion, although prospects have been affected by events in Fukushima. It is seen as having only a 6% share in 2035.

[Slide 3]
To meet this growth, there are plenty of available resources.

For oil, conventional, as well as non-conventional resources are sufficient for the foreseeable future.

We expect to see significant increases in conventional oil supply from Brazil, the Caspian region, and of course OPEC, as well as steady increases in non-conventional oil and natural gas liquids.

Nevertheless, some continue to question whether this projected oil demand increase can be met. Let me firmly state: yes it can.

It is true the world will need significant additional production capacity to 2035, including to compensate for natural decline in oil fields. But this is nothing new for the industry. This has always been the case. Today's challenges are no different from those faced in the past. Our industry has always been able to deliver.

And let me stress, significant investments are being made today. For the five-year period 2012-2016, OPEC's Member Countries currently have 116 upstream projects in their portfolio. Should all projects be realized, this could translate into an investment figure of close to $280 billion.

Taking into account all OPEC liquids, the net increase is estimated to be close to 7 mb/d above 2012 levels, although investment decisions and plans will obviously be influenced by various factors, such as the global economic situation, policies and the price of oil.

Moreover, technological advances will continue to extend the reach of the industry - helping to reduce costs, unlock additional resources and increase supplies.

[Slide 4]
It is clear that future oil demand can be met.

However, the future is rarely what we think it is today. There are a variety of uncertainties that may adversely impact demand.

In the medium-term, the main one is the global economy. There are many questions, but at present, few answers.

In Europe, what will be the outcome of the sovereign debt crisis, and the austerity versus growth debate?

Across the Atlantic, the US economy seems to be relatively resilient, but challenges remain.

Japan is expected to continue its recent recovery, but expansion remains fragile.

Is the recent slowing down of China and India's economic growth a long-term trend, or just a short-term issue?

And in developing countries, will problems in the OECD region spill over into their economies, particularly in terms of reduced demand for their exports, as well as less investment capital?

[Slide 5]
From the demand-side, there are also the environmental and energy policies of a number of consuming countries. Obviously, every country has the sovereign right to set its own policies. But it is essential that they provide a clear idea as to the potential impact of policies on future oil consumption levels, as well as overall energy supply and demand patterns.

It is easy to understand why - given the many uncertainties associated with oil demand projections that are highlighted in scenarios in our World Oil Outlook.

There is the Accelerated Transportation Technology and Policy scenario, which underscores how technologies and policies could advance and quicken developments in the transportation sector. And there are scenarios that examine the possibilities for higher and lower economic growth.

What these scenarios underscore are genuine concerns over security of demand. There are major demand uncertainties.

I am sure we can also appreciate that this leads to investment uncertainty. And if investments are not made in a timely and adequate manner, then future consumer needs might not be met.

The industry as a whole also faces other challenges.

This includes the ongoing need to reduce excessive market volatility. We cannot avoid speculation and volatility altogether. However, it is essential we look to mitigate extreme volatility and excessive speculation. These are detrimental.

The issue of speculation is a topic that has seen a number of joint workshops organized between the IEA, the IEF and OPEC, as agreed upon at the 12th IEF in Mexico in 2010.

Then there is the acute need for skilled human resources. Given today's economic climate, this may at times be forgotten. With strong competition from other sectors for skilled workers, there is a need to address the oil industry's difficulties in finding and hiring labour at the global level.

And here, I should like to underscore one further challenge; that of energy poverty. We need to remember that 1.4 billion people have no access to electricity and some 2.7 billion rely on traditional biomass for their basic needs. Alleviating energy poverty is a priority for sustainable development. It needs the urgent attention of world leaders. The Rio+20 meeting later this month is a great opportunity in this regard.

[Slide 6]
When looking at the challenges before us, however, we should also think about the often related opportunities. For example:

[Slide 7]
Before concluding, I would like to touch on one other theme that is highlighted in the programme: 'potential game-changers'.

The first is shale oil and shale gas. It is clear they are already changing the energy landscape in the US, and there are evidently possibilities elsewhere. However, challenges associated with the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing remain, especially on groundwater supplies. And while technology and scientific innovation will help eventually solve these problems, it will take time.

And there is also much talk about alternative transportation technologies. At OPEC, we recognize that there will be developments and advancements in areas such as electric and hybrid vehicles. They will see market growth, albeit from a low base. However, we believe that oil and increasingly efficient conventional powertrain technologies will remain central to the transportation sector in the foreseeable future.

[Slide 8]
Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Energy use will continue to grow. It will remain central to our everyday lives; the heartbeat of our increasingly interdependent and complex world.

In terms of resources, there are more than enough to meet expected demand growth.

And overall, fossil fuels will continue to supply over 80% of our energy needs by 2035, with oil the energy type with the largest share for most of this period.

Finally, given the long-term nature of our industry and the need for clarity and predictability - not only for oil, but energy in general - I would like to leave you with three appropriate words: 'stability, stability, stability'.

Stability for investments and expansion to flourish;
Stability for economies around the world to grow;
And stability for producers that allows them a fair return from the exploitation of their exhaustible natural resources.

Stability is the key to a sustainable global energy future for us all.

"2012-06-13","​Honourable President of the OPEC Conference,
​Ministers, Mr. Secretary General,
​Distinguished participants!

​I am very pleased to take part in the opening of this high level International OPEC-Seminar. I very much value the efforts the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC to extend the dialogue and cooperation on energy issues.

​Questions such as the need for secure and affordable energy, sustainable development and poverty eradication have become increasingly important for today's societies.

​Vienna has been home to OPEC since 1965. Your organisation's stature and outreach have grown considerably over the decades. In 2010, Vienna was honoured by being the venue of your 50th anniversary celebrations. On that occasion, you also inaugurated your new premises in Vienna to which you had relocated your offices in 2009; premises well suited to accommodate your need for up-to-date conference facilities and sophisticated support technologies.

​Vienna is a host to many key international institutions, and several of them are closely involved in energy matters. The convening of important meetings of top international decision makers and experts in our City, in discussing the energy-related challenges in today's world, are highly beneficial to Vienna's role as a center of dialogue.

​Contributing to the stabilisation of global energy markets has become a main focus of your Organisation's planning and coordinating activities. Market and price volatility with its disturbing, disruptive and damaging effects on both economic growth and investment are addressed by your Organisation on a daily basis. This is even more important in today's crisis-stricken global environment which needs to recover from financial and economic turmoil.

​You have chosen the avenue of engaging and promoting an enhanced dialogue between consumers and producers. There have been significant achievements, as reflected in the activities of the International Energy Forum to which OPEC is strongly committed, but also in the ongoing meaningful dialogue between OPEC and the European Union.

​I am happy to underline that a number of Austrian companies have close links with OPEC Member Countries in terms of oil and gas activities, from exploration and production to refineries and petrochemicals, as well as in renewables. There are good prospects for increased co-operation under the developing schemes of new energy corridors, in accordance with the European Union's diversification strategy. Austria, as a leader in hydropower development, can also help to develop infrastructure and hydropower schemes in OPEC-Member countries.

​You are also firmly committed to spreading the benefits of Petroleum. Your efforts aim at diversifying economic development and at promoting social progress both in your Member Countries and for the benefit of more disadvantaged countries and regions. This mission has been carried forward in particular through the activities of your sister organisation, the OPEC Fund for International Development OFID, which I have visited recently.

​The funds mobilized since its creation in 1975 for financial assistance to more than a hundred countries and in cooperation with hundreds of organisations world-wide are really impressive.

​Equally impressive is the target-oriented work of the Fund, which has more recently introduced a new and very timely key priority, namely combatting poverty especially in the field of energy. Energy being an enabling factor as a basis for health-services, education and productive activities, should become universally accessible and affordable. It is most reassuring that this aim, recently launched in the form of the UN-Secretary General's initiative ""Sustainable Energy 4 ALL"", is so clearly shared by a huge and powerful stakeholder organisation of energy producers, as is OPEC.

​Ladies and Gentlemen, in the light of these praise-worthy targets and values, let me wish you good discussions and all success to your Conference.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/225-13-june-2012.html"
"2012-05-03","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

I would like to begin by thanking the organizers of this event for the opportunity to deliver this keynote address on the current oil market situation. It gives me great pleasure to be here in Paris.

[Slide 2]
I think we can all appreciate that both last year and the first part of this year have been another eventful and testing time for the global oil and energy industries.

Last year saw much turbulence in the global economy, alongside events that none of us could have predicted – such as the uprisings in a number of countries in North Africa and the Middle East, and the destructive Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent nuclear crisis.

This year we continue to see much uncertainty about the future of the global economy; oil prices trending upwards; much focus on geopolitics; as well as supply disruptions in Syria, South Sudan, Yemen and the North Sea, although this has been offset by Libya taking enormous strides in bringing its production back to pre-uprising levels.

While there has been no shortage of oil in the market, as we head into the second half of 2012 there remain many concerns for the market to digest and act upon.

[Slide 3]
Global economic growth continues to be patchy and uncertain.

In the US, there have been some recent positive signs. The US Federal reserve has suggested that there are grounds for “cautious optimism” and both labour market and consumer confidence are improving. However, GDP for the first quarter of this year, at 2.1 per cent, is a little down on the 3 per cent for the final quarter of last year.

In Japan, there have been some improvements in areas such as manufacturing and consumption, but the country is still suffering from the consequences of last year’s triple disaster.

The Euro-zone continues to struggle with sovereign debt issues, with yields on Spanish and Italian rising again. The region’s economic growth continues to decline with the forecast for this year now a contraction of 0.3%, with Greece seeing a deeper-than-expected fall of 5%. And unemployment rates remain high. There are many uncertainties for Euro-zone leaders. The road ahead remains extremely rocky.

The UK has recently announced that it has slipped into its first double-dip recession since 1975.

In China, while economic growth remains above eight per cent, recent data suggests that the economy is slowing. However, it is unclear whether this is a long-term trend, or just a short-term issue.

And in developing countries, in general, there are concerns as to whether problems in the OECD will spill over into their economies, particularly in terms of reduced demand for their exports, as well as less investment capital from the developed world.

There is clearly much to keep policymakers engaged as countries and regions strive to get their economies back on track. The economic recovery remains fragile.

[Slide 4]
In terms of prices, this year we have generally seen moving in an upwards direction.

However, current prices are not due to market fundamentals. Speculation is pushing prices higher. Trading is being made on the perception of a supply shortage, rather than evidence of any actual or impending shortfall. It is related to geopolitics. In many respects it can be described as a ‘fear factor’.

As we are all aware, oil is increasingly being treated as an individual asset class by financial investors. Since 2005, the total open interest of the NYMEX and ICE Brent crude oil futures and options has increased sharply.

Today, the level of open interest on the NYMEX is close to 3 million contracts. And combined with Brent it is 3.85 million. It means that the level of open interest on these two exchanges is equivalent to more than 44 times the size of physical demand.

The issue of speculation was discussed in much detail at the recent 13th International Energy Forum (IEF) Ministerial in Kuwait. It is also a topic that has been an area of cooperation between the International Energy Agency (IEA), the IEF and OPEC, agreed upon at the12th IEF in Mexico in 2010. To date this has included two workshops and forums on the inter-linkages between physical and financial energy markets, and on regulation.

I am sure everyone here can appreciate that we cannot avoid speculation and volatility altogether. It is a part of the market. However, it is essential that we look to mitigate extreme volatility and excessive speculation, which are detrimental.

It is important that prices do not impede economic growth.

[Slide 5]
On the supply side, this year there have been disruptions in Syria, South Sudan, the Yemen and the North Sea. These developments, however, have had minimal impact on the market. And in reality they have been more than offset by the quick return of Libyan crude to the market. In December last year, Libyan crude was close to 800,000 barrels a day, whereas now it is around pre-war levels of 1.5 million barrels a day.

In addition, it should be noted that the first quarter of the year saw a relatively strong increase in non-OPEC supply. From the 2011 average, it increased 400,000 barrels a day in the first quarter of this year, led mainly by developments in North America.

As this slide underscores, world oil supply is increasing. It has done significantly since May of last year.

This leads me to the question: Where do we stand today?

Allow me to give you some further figures.

[Slide 6]
Total OECD commercial oil stocks remain at healthy levels. In the past month or so they have trended upwards and are now above the five-year average.

Forward demand cover in March for the OECD is over 59 days, compared to the five-year average of 56.

And there has also been a steady build up in commercial and strategic petroleum reserve stocks in non-OECD regions, such as China and India.

[Slide 7]
In terms of OPEC crude production, there has been a steady rise over the past few years, as shown in this slide. In fact, since March 2011 there has been an increase from 28.8 million barrels a day to the current 31.3 million barrels a day.

The Organization is making sure its consumer’s needs are met.

At the same time, spare capacity remains at comfortable levels. For OPEC, it is around 8% to 10% of its total capacity. And we see these comfortable levels remaining for the foreseeable future.

When looking at the global demand and supply balance, the story for 2012 is one of rising demand and plenty of supply to meet this increase. The projection is for a surplus supply balance in each quarter of 2012.

Global oil demand is forecast to grow by around 900,000 barrels a day in 2012. Non-OPEC supply is expected to increase by 600,000 barrels a day in 2012.

And from OPEC’s perspective, demand for its crude in 2012 is projected to average 30 million barrels a day. This is more than 1 million barrels a day lower than its current production volume.

It reinforces the Organization’s commitment to market stability.

[Slide 8]
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Allow me to reiterate my key messages concerning the current oil market situation.

What is clear is that there has been no shortage of oil in the market. Producers have been able to meet consumer’s needs. There has been, and there remains, more than enough supply to meet demand. We also see this as the case for the rest of 2012 and the foreseeable future.

Global economic growth remains an uncertainty, with the Euro-zone continuing to be the main area of concern.

And today’s price levels continue to be driven by excessive speculation. It is essential we look to mitigate this.

Our goal today, and in the future, must be one focused on stability. It is critical we focus on the market fundamentals and continue to evolve a clear and consistent environment; one that enables the industry to develop, produce, transport, refine and deliver energy in an ever-more efficient and economic manner.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/226-3-may-2012.html"
"2012-03-14","Thank you Mr Chairman,
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
Let me begin by thanking the Kuwaiti Government for hosting this meeting and the co-hosts Algeria and the Netherlands for their contribution and support. 
 
[SLIDE 2]
The theme of this session is: 'Energy Markets: Mitigating Volatility'. What I would like to stress upfront is that concerns surrounding volatility in commodity markets, in general, and energy markets, in particular, are not new.

The issue remains an obstacle for the world economy; for those producing countries whose economies are still highly dependent on oil export revenues; and for consumers whose energy needs continues to be primarily satisfied by fossil fuels. In truth, it matters for each and every one of us.

We all remember that, back in the late 1990s, prices plunged below 10 dollars a barrel in the wake of the Asian financial crisis. At the time, on the occasion of the 6th IEF meeting in South Africa, OPEC stressed that these price levels were not suitable for producers, and in the long-term, they were not beneficial to consumers.

This proved to be true. Investment stalled and human resources shrunk, when the industry undertook deep cost-cutting strategies. This, in turn, meant the market tightened quickly as the global economy and oil demand rebounded a few years later. Without the availability of OPEC's spare capacity, such tightening would have been even sharper.

More recently, price swings were even larger and faster. For oil, in mid-2008, crude prices reached a peak of 147 dollars a barrel. They then sank to the low 30 dollars in December of the same year.

In addition, daily price changes have been greater since 2007.
 
[SLIDE 3]
However, many believe that price fluctuations are today amplified by a new phenomenon: the financialization of commodity markets, in general, and oil markets, in particular.

Since 2004, the participation of financial players has grown significantly.

For example, the number of outstanding exchange-traded commodity contracts has expanded from a level of around 15 million contracts in 2004 to more than 60 million contracts today. Over-the-counter commodity derivatives also sharply increased between 2004 and 2008, with notional amounts outstanding increasing from one trillion dollars to more than 12 trillion.

New players have also entered the market, such as index funds and exchange trade fund sponsors.

And the strategies of the participants have become more varied and more complex. This includes hedging against inflation or currency fluctuations, portfolio return risk management, arbitrage opportunities, index tracking, herd behavior and speculation. Recently, a new feature is the development of high frequency trading.

[SLIDE 4]
This phenomenon has been visible in oil markets.

In addition to oil being a physical commodity, it has increasingly been treated by financial investors as an individual asset class.

Oil-related derivatives markets have expanded sharply in terms of size, participants, types of contracts and complexity. For example, since 2005, the total open interest of the NYMEX crude oil futures and options has increased sharply. In the middle of 2008, it surpassed three million contracts per day. This was 35 times the size of physical world oil demand. Today, the level of open interest is equivalent to 29 times the size of physical demand.

[SLIDE 5]
This leads to the question: do futures prices still reflect the physical supply and demand fundamentals, or are they mainly driven by financial motivations?

It is a question that has attracted attention in recent years. The Jeddah Energy Meeting held in June 2008 was a landmark meeting in this regard. It helped in the convergence between producers and consumers on the issue of excessive energy market volatility and the need to mitigate it.

Areas of cooperation were agreed by the IEA, the IEF and OPEC on the occasion of the 12th IEF in Cancun. And over the past two years we have seen the successful implementation of this programme of cooperation.

This has included two workshops and forums on the inter-linkages between physical and financial energy markets and on regulation, where discussions have reflected a wide diversity of views.

Some participants attributed the recent price movements to oil physical fundamentals, while acknowledging the impact of financial markets on short term price changes.

Other participants saw speculative activity and the financialization of commodities as amplifying price movements and leading to excessive market volatility.

And there are others who regard crude oil price formation as consisting of a complex interaction of physical and financial factors, including speculation in financial markets.

At OPEC, we believe that massive and rapid in- and out-flows of financial investments into oil markets can alter price dynamics away from fundamentals. This can exaggerate price swings, both up and down, in the short-term, and, if persistent, in the medium- to long-term. 

Regulatory reforms are already being proposed, for financial markets, in general, and commodity markets, in particular. And efforts to increase transparency and oversight in the commodity derivative markets are underway, on both the futures exchanges, as well as the over-the-counter derivatives markets.

However, it is still too early to judge the overall impacts of these reforms and it is important to monitor such developments and their potential impacts on the functioning of markets.

In recent years, we have also witnessed the further strengthening of the Joint Organisations Data Initiative. The value of timely, more accurate and transparent data is essential to our industry. Last year JODI celebrated its 10th Anniversary. We applaud its efforts. OPEC is proud to have played a role in JODI's establishment and we continue to fully support the Initiative.

[SLIDE 6]
While it is short-term price volatility that usually makes the headlines, the long-term price of oil matters too. Our industry is capital intensive, with long lead times and payback periods. And we need to remember that security of demand is as important as security of supply. 

This leads me to look to the future of oil. It offers some very difficult questions, relating to such things as foreseeing future economic growth; the possible impacts of the financial crisis; the effect of technology on the demand and supply side; policies; consumer preferences; and, of course, geopolitics.

Given the complexity of these drivers, and the wide spectrum of feasible future energy scenes, the OPEC Secretariat has developed a scenario-based approach for the long-term.

Under OPEC's World Oil Outlook Reference Case, which assumes a continuation of past trends, over the period 2010-2035, energy demand increases by 51 per cent. Fossil fuels will still satisfy the lion's share of world energy needs, contributing up to 82 per cent of the global energy mix by 2035. Resources are sufficient in this regard.

Demand for oil is expected to increase by close to 23 million barrels a day over the period 2010-2035, reaching almost 110 million barrels a day by 2035, driven mainly by developing Asia and by the transportation sector in non-OECD countries. But the share of oil in the energy mix is expected to decline from 34 per cent today to around 28 per cent in 2035.

[SLIDE 7]
However, the future is rarely a simple continuation of the past.

Many uncertainties are associated with oil demand projections, which can be viewed in scenarios from our World Oil Outlook.

For instance, OPEC's Accelerated Transportation Technology and Policy scenario indicates that global oil use could be more than 7 million barrels a day lower by 2035, compared to the Reference Case.

And between higher and lower economic growth scenarios, there is an almost 20 million barrels a day difference.

This leads me to ask a number of questions about these scenarios. What would be the impact on prices? What would be the effect on investments? And what might it mean for more expensive sources of oil, such as non-conventionals? The two common words that arise with to each of these questions are 'uncertainty' and 'instability'.

Let me stress that if there is no confidence in there being additional demand for oil, there is no incentive to invest. Why waste precious financial resources on unneeded capacity? On the other hand, if investments are not made in a timely and adequate manner, then future consumer needs might not be met.

[SLIDE 8]
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,
I am sure everyone here can appreciate that we cannot avoid speculation and volatility altogether. It is a part of the market.

However, it is essential to mitigate extreme volatility and excessive speculation, which are detrimental.

Thus, it is important we look to well-designed regulatory reforms, continually improve the quality and timeliness of data and strengthen JODI, advance academic research, and further enhance the producer-consumer dialogue.

In recent years, the producer-consumer dialogue has taken significant steps in this regard. It is important we continue to follow up on these actions.

I think we all recognize the value of this. Oil will continue to play a major role in the world economy, and in the socio-economic development of billions of people, while ensuring the world moves along the path toward a sustainable energy future. It matters to us all.

That is why our constructive dialogue needs to be pursued.

[SLIDE 9]
Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/227-14-march-2012.html"
"2012-01-30","Ladies and gentlemen: Good morning.

Let me begin by thanking Chatham House for inviting me to speak about the Middle East and North Africa - MENA.

With an estimated population of more than 300 million people, the countries of the MENA region have a great diversity of people, languages and cultures. They also have many things in common, which has given them a strong sense of identity.

Some call the MENA region the ""cradle of civilization"". Three of the world's major religions began there. And it has certainly played an important role in history.

But I am not here to talk about religion or ancient history. I will leave that to someone else. I would like to speak about OPEC's Member Countries in MENA - their role in the energy balance and their importance to the rest of the world.

The MENA Region

The MENA region's geographic position - and its abundant natural resources - have given it immense strategic importance. And its circumstances have become closely linked to the stability of the rest of the world. This is why it should always be kept in a state of peace and tranquillity.

Unfortunately this has not always been the case. Recent events have illustrated how delicate things are. Unrest of different sorts has spread across the MENA region for months - and this has affected oil supply levels.

Thankfully, the enormous effort of OPEC's Member Countries - eight of which are located in the MENA region - has helped to mitigate the impact on oil supplies.

In fact, many of OPEC's Members in the region are strategic trading partners with the rest of the world, especially as key suppliers of oil.

Their overall resource endowments speak to their importance.

For most of these countries, oil and gas also form the backbone of their economies and trade.

These exports are absolutely critical since their revenues are essential to meet the social and development needs of OPEC countries.

The amount of oil supplied daily to the market by OPEC Members in the MENA region is also substantial.

The MENA region is obviously critical to satisfying the world's energy needs. This is why any uncertainty in the region is likely to have a serious global impact.

The Global Economy

But today the world cannot afford any uncertainty. The lingering effects of the 2008 global economic crisis continue to negatively affect some of the world's biggest economies.

Global Demand

But despite this economic uncertainty, our data show long-term growth in energy consumption.

In our World Oil Outlook, OPEC sees global energy demand increasing under all scenarios - with primary global energy demand to 2035 doubling in the Reference Case.

The key to this future oil demand growth will be the transportation sector in non-OECD countries, which will account for 88% of the demand increase to 2035.

Domestic Demand

Another source of rising oil demand is growing domestic demand in the MENA region.

In fact, some countries in the region have some of the fastest growing energy demand in the world. And domestic consumption of crude oil - primarily for power-generating purposes - has increased in several countries.

Of course, these countries realize that with local energy consumption rising, they need to find ways to expand and diversify their energy supplies. Otherwise, this may negatively affect their oil exports.

Some OPEC countries in MENA are already exploring for more oil and gas. Others are developing recent gas discoveries.

But countries are looking at other alternatives, too - including solar, wind and even nuclear power - to meet rising domestic energy consumption.

If the problem of satisfying domestic energy demand while also keeping crude export levels is left without a solution, it could seriously affect some MENA countries.

Investments

With energy demand growing both in MENA and developing Asia, the importance of maintaining upstream energy investments is clear.

More specifically, in OPEC's Member Countries in MENA, we can see a strong commitment to upstream investments in crude oil, NGLs and GTLs.

In addition, downstream investment projects across the entire MENA region continue to point to the growing importance of oil and gas products.

OPEC's Role

By maintaining their overall commitment to energy investments in the oil sector, OPEC's Members are not only safeguarding their oil revenues. They are also taking steps to ensure global supply.

OPEC Member Countries - which produce two-fifths of global crude supply - will continue to strive to meet consumer demand while ensuring market stability. Through OPEC, they will also continue to use production allocations or any other means to respond to the market and ensure its stability.

At the last OPEC meeting in December, our Members agreed to produce an average of 30 million b/d in 2012 - unless something drastic happens to disrupt the market.

But there are other actions that our Members have taken to ensure supply and stability.

The growing use of Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques, for example, has helped many of them increase their proven reserves, keep older oil fields productive and be better prepared to respond to supply emergencies.

But ongoing coordinated efforts are needed to make sure that global supply is balanced and that the market is stable. Any situation of oversupply, for example, would be detrimental to the industry - and could lead to the adverse situation we faced in the 1980s.

Oil Companies

There is also an increased collaboration between our Member Country National Oil Companies (NOCs) and the world's International Oil Companies (IOCs). And many things can be achieved together - especially in the area of technological know-how.

But the role of our NOCs has also been evolving. Many of them are now investing abroad - beyond their home countries, outside of their ""comfort zone"" - and are engaging in healthy competition with IOCs in the international arena.

This is a good development. It means we have more energy actors around the world and a more interesting global landscape. So as our crude oil sources grow more diverse, the diversity of producers is expanding as well.

The Energy Mix

Speaking of diversity, let me say a few words about the energy mix.

Expanding our energy resources is good for the world - especially for the poor in the developing world who still rely on the burning of biomass.

Most recently, we have been monitoring the development of shale gas in the Americas with interest, especially since many of OPEC's Members in the MENA region - Algeria, IR Iran, Libya, Qatar and Saudi Arabia - are also gas producers.

Generally, we think shale gas holds great promise. We see it as part of diverse energy mix - something we have always welcomed.

But shale gas is still in early stages of development. And there are concerns about the potential environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing, especially on groundwater supplies. While technology and scientific innovation will help eventually solve these problems, it will take time.

The contributions of technology and R&D also remain critical to the oil industry. In fact, OPEC continues to participate in R&D conferences with other energy stakeholders.

Sharing experiences with new technology can benefit everyone. We have seen this happen with efforts to reduce the industry's environmental impact.

Carbon Capture and Storage technology, for example, has been discussed and shared by many in the industry. It has been recognized as having important climate change mitigation potential.

Conclusion

Behind everything I have said today lies the importance of relationships - between producers and consumers, among IOCs and NOCs, and among all stakeholders. Bringing us together is a commitment to keeping the market stable.

But it is important to stress once more how important the MENA region is to the rest of the world. It certainly has its share of challenges and difficulties. But in terms of energy, it is vital - which is why we should always strive to ensure peace, cooperation and stability there.

Cooperative exchanges and constructive actions can achieve great things. In December, OPEC Members had agreement on 30 million b/d. Today we are already at 30.6 million barrels and there is no shortage in the market.

Soon even Libyan production will be back and we hope we can then look forward to stability - not just in the MENA region but in the global markets.

We hope 2012 does not turn out to be a challenging year. But, as in the past, we in OPEC are always ready to continue that ""quest"" to meet the world's energy needs - and, when necessary, take actions that are of benefit to all.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/228-30-january-2012.html"
"2011-12-09","​Climate change is a concern for us all. The historical responsibility of developed countries in regard to the state of the Earth’s atmosphere cannot be ignored. Socio-economic development and poverty eradication are the overriding priorities of developing countries.

​These are the basic facts that guide OPEC Member Countries in the UNFCCC-related negotiations. Such countries have played a positive and constructive role, aiming at win-win solutions that take into consideration the interests of all Parties. They remain committed to this, and to the objective of engaging with all Parties for a comprehensive, balanced and consensus-based outcome that is satisfactory to all.

​The UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol should remain at the centre of all actions. The overriding priority is an agreement on a second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol, without delay. Commitments should be meaningful, ambitious and unconditional. The Kyoto Protocol should not be abandoned.

​Another priority is that the outcome of the work under the Ad-Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action should be comprehensive and cover all the building blocks of the Bali Action Plan. It must be balanced and consistent with all the provisions and principles of the Convention; especially the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It must satisfy the interests of all Parties. This is a fundamental requirement of UN multilateral negotiations. Issues related to adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building are particularly important.

​OPEC Member Countries have an important responsibility: to ensure the adequate supply of a non-renewable, exhaustible commodity that is essential to world energy needs and to the world economy.

​OPEC Member Countries are developing countries, whose economies rely heavily on petroleum export revenues. They are vulnerable to climate change, as well as to the adverse impacts of response measures. This is recognized in the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol. Any outcome in Durban should address such vulnerabilities in relation to adaptation, finance, capacity building and technology transfer. This should include the eligibility of carbon capture and storage under the clean development mechanism.

​In conclusion, OPEC Member Countries hope for successful negotiations in Durban and an outcome that is effective, sustained and satisfactory to all.

"2011-12-07","Ladies and gentlemen, Good morning.

I would like to begin by thanking the organizers, the World Petroleum Council, for the invitation to speak at this 20th World Petroleum Congress. It gives me great pleasure to be part of such an important event; and one taking place in Qatar, an OPEC Member Country.

I am also happy to share a platform for the first time with my fellow speaker, the Executive Director of the IEA, (Her Excellency) Maria van der Hoeven. We have already met and spoken on a number of occasions and I feel our relationship is a very positive one.

[Slide 2]
Given today's topic - 'producer - consumer dialogue: expectations and deliverables' - let me stress upfront that OPEC has long recognized the value of adopting a cooperative approach to addressing major topical issues.

Today, it is clear the importance of dialogue between all stakeholders has never been greater in our increasingly interdependent world. And the heartbeat of this world is the global energy system.

It is a global, complex and ever expanding system; one that is finely balanced and where stability must be the mantra.

[Slide 3]
With the global energy system expected to grow significantly in the coming decades, the importance of advancing our understanding of each other has never been so crucial.

It is essential we better appreciate each other's viewpoints; are realistic in our targets and goals; and are more pragmatic in our discussions.

From OPEC's perspective, our thoughts on the global oil scene are set out in the annual World Oil Outlook, with the most recent version published last month.

In the Reference Case for this year's Outlook, energy demand increases by more than 50% over the period 2010-to-2035.

Fossil fuels, currently accounting for 87% of the world's energy supply, will still contribute 82% of the global total by 2035. For most of the period to 2035, oil will remain the energy type with the largest share, although its overall share will fall from 34% to 28%. It will remain key to growth in the transportation sector. Coal's overall share remains similar to today, at around 29%, whereas gas sees its share increase from 23% to 25%.

In terms of non-fossil fuels, renewable energy will grow fast, but since this starts from a low base its share is still only 3% by 2035. Hydropower increases a little, to 3% by 2035. Nuclear power also witnesses some expansion, although prospects for nuclear have clearly been affected by events in Fukushima. It is at 6% in 2035.

There are also plenty of resources to meet these growth patterns. For oil, conventional and non-conventional resources are clearly plentiful for the foreseeable future.

As in the past, technological advances will continue to extend the reach of the industry, reduce costs and unlock additional resources. This can be viewed in the recent developments for both shale gas and shale oil, particularly in the US, although there is also potential for these resources globally.

[Slide 4]
From the oil demand perspective, the central driver for medium-term prospects is the global economy. Given the current economic landscape, there are clearly many uncertainties as to how this might play out in the coming years.

What will be the outcome of Europe's sovereign debt crisis?

How will the US tackle its slowing growth?

And what will be the impact of China's and India's moves to combat overheating and inflation?

Looking to the long-term, other important drivers come in to play: policies, technologies, demographics and consumer preferences. In our Reference Case, demand increases by close to 23 mb/d over the period 2010-2035, reaching almost 110 mb/d by 2035. Fully 80% of the increase in global demand is in developing Asia.

However, oil use per capita in the OECD will remain much higher than in developing countries. By 2035, oil use per head in developing countries will average just three barrels, compared to close to 12 barrels for the OECD.

As with the medium-term, however, it is important to stress that there are a number of uncertainties that could mean this demand figure is significantly higher or lower.

Of particular concern to producing countries are the policies of a number of consuming countries. Obviously, every country has the sovereign right to set its own policies, but it is essential that these provide a clear picture as to their impact on future oil consumption levels and overall energy supply and demand patterns. They need to be feasible, predictable and sustainable. And they should not discriminate against oil.

[Slide 5]
Turning to oil supply, over the long-term there will be increases in conventional oil supply from the Caspian, Brazil, and of course OPEC, as well as steady increases in non-conventional oil. Total non-OPEC supply in the Reference Case increases around 8 mb/d over the period 2010-to-2035. OPEC crude supply rises throughout this timeframe, increasing by 10 mb/d, to reach just over 39 mb/d by 2035. And OPEC NGLs also rise strongly.

The World Oil Outlook also underlines the Organization's commitment to sufficient and secure crude oil supplies. It shows that Member Countries currently have around 132 upstream projects on the table for the five-year period 2011-2015.

This could translate into an investment figure of close to $300 billion should all projects be realized. Taking into account all OPEC liquids the net increase is estimated to be close to 7 mb/d above 2011 levels.

As I have already alluded to, however, these investment decisions and timings are influenced by many factors, such as the global economic situation, policies and the price of oil. There are therefore genuine concerns over security of demand.

[Slide 6]
I would also like to take the opportunity to briefly explore the current oil market situation. This year has seen the oil market in a constant state of flux: the ups and downs of the global economic recovery; Japan's multiple disaster; unrest in parts of North Africa and the Middle East. What has been apparent, however, is that there has been no shortage of oil anywhere in the world.

Libya's shortfall earlier this year was met by other OPEC Member Countries. And Libya is now quickly returning its production and export capacity to the market.

Spare capacity has been, and remains at comfortable levels. And the investments I have just outlined will see these comfortable levels increase in the coming years.

In terms of prices, I think the average price level for this year is satisfactory for both producers and consumers.

It is at a level that allows producers to invest to meet future demand, and at the same time, it does not impede the global economic recovery.

[Slide 7]
For prices, however, speculative activities remain an issue in the current market.

This can be viewed in the respective sizes of the paper and physical markets. Since 2005, there has been a sharp increase in the number of open interest futures and options contracts. At times it has surpassed three million contracts per day, equivalent to 3 bln b/d. This is 35 times the size of actual world oil demand.

It should also be noted that between 2009 and 2011, data shows an almost one-to-one correlation between WTI prices and the speculative activity of the net long positions of money managers. This is in terms of both volume and value.

Let me stress, excessive speculation is detrimental to both producers and consumers and can cause prices to detach from fundamentals. It is essential to avoid distorting the essential price discovery function of the market.

[Slide 8]
From this brief review of the energy scene, as well as the oil market, I think we can all appreciate the benefits of dialogue and cooperation. We need to continually evolve our understanding of each other.

In addition, we also need to recognize that there are other specific challenges for the industry's stakeholders, as well as for world leaders, in the years ahead.

I am sure many of us here are keeping a close eye on the current negotiations at the UN Climate Conference in Durban. OPEC recognizes the importance of being part of these negotiations to develop solutions that safeguard the legitimate interests of all Parties.

It is essential that these multilateral negotiations reach an agreement that is comprehensive, balanced, fair and equitable; one that respects all the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Climate Change Convention and its Kyoto Protocol.

I welcome this year's World Petroleum Congress theme: 'Energy Solutions for All: Promoting Cooperation, Innovation and Investment'. It is essential everyone has access to reliable and sustainable modern energy services.

We need to remember that 1.4 billion people have no access to electricity and some 2.7 billion rely on biomass for their basic needs.

Sustainable development is a high priority agenda for OPEC Member Countries, all developing nations. It is also the main objective of the assistance they provide to other developing countries, directly through their own aid institutions, as well as through the OPEC Fund for International Development, which is an active participant in the UN Initiative of 'Sustainable Energy for All'.

Energy poverty needs the urgent and critical attention of world leaders. Rio+20 next year is a great opportunity in this regard.

Another ongoing challenge relates to excessive market volatility and the continuing trend towards oil acting as a heavily traded financial asset, an issue I touched upon earlier.

There is a need for a better understanding of the effects of excessive market volatility and the role of speculation. In fact, only last week, OPEC, along with the IEA and the International Energy Forum (IEF), organized a workshop in Vienna that examined the issues surrounding the interactions between physical and financial energy markets.

We should also not forget the human resource. With strong competition from other sectors for skilled staff and many in our industry approaching retirement, there is a need to address the difficulties in finding and hiring labour at the global level. This means concerted efforts to restore this essential capacity, by facilitating education and training in energy disciplines, and making the industry an attractive career choice.

[Slide 9]
What I hope I have underlined here are some of the key issues we need to talk about and cooperate on; both as part of the industry's producer-consumer dialogue, and at the broader global and multilateral level.

Cooperation between OPEC and the IEA goes back many years and has advanced considerably in recent times. OPEC sees the dialogue between the two as an important element in improving the understanding of the concerns of all parties for oil market stability and predictability. I am sure my fellow panelist will agree when I say: long may this positive cooperation continue.

Over the last year or so, and as part of the Cancun Ministerial Declaration from the IEF Meeting in April 2010, the two organizations, along with the IEF, have held a number of workshops on financial markets, energy regulation and in January this year, the three organizations held the first annual Symposium on Energy Outlooks in Riyadh. The latter event provided a platform for sharing insights and exchanging views about energy trends and uncertainties, as well as short-, medium- and long-term energy outlooks.

In February next year, OPEC and the IEA will also hold a joint workshop on the use of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery in Kuwait. I think both of our organizations view this as a potential 'win-win' approach. OPEC also participates in the IEA Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Programme.

Elsewhere, OPEC actively participates in the IEF's Joint Oil Data Initiative set up to enhance the transparency, quality, timeliness and flows of oil market data.

We continue to maintain a strong and positive relationship with the European Union, with our 8th Ministerial-level meeting taking place in June this year. Workshops and roundtables with the EU have covered such topics as carbon capture and storage; the impact of the economic crisis on oil investment; and, technological advances in the road transportation sector.

OPEC, alongside the World Bank, the OECD and the IEA, has also been heavily involved in collaborative work related to the G-20 Energy Agenda. Ongoing work streams include energy subsidies, a study on price reporting agencies and the Global Marine Environment Protection Initiative.

And we have also furthered dialogue with other non-OPEC producers and various UN bodies.

Ladies and gentlemen,

[Slide 10]
So what of the future of the producer-consumer dialogue? Obviously, I do not have a crystal ball, but I do feel I can leave you with a few thoughts.

I cannot stand here and say that we will find agreement on everything. We don't live in a perfect world. It is important, however, for producers and consumers to find common ground. And with this in mind:

We need to look for shared solutions, where and when appropriate.

We need to have a producer-consumer environment that is conducive to reaching constructive end results.

And we need input from each and every stakeholder.

At OPEC, we believe in continuing to develop existing and new avenues of cooperation with innovative thinking, collaboration and swift action on key issues, many of which are complex, broad and inter-related.

Our shared objective must be a stable and sustainable energy future in an increasingly interdependent world.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/230-7-december-2011.html"
"2011-11-01","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen:

Let me begin by thanking His Excellency Engineer Rostam Ghasemi - Iran's Petroleum Minister and President of the OPEC Conference - for inviting me to attend the Institute for International Energy Studies conference.

It is an honour to be here in Tehran, the capital of one of OPEC's five Founding Members.

The theme of this year's conference is technology - which as we all know is at the heart of all the great achievements in the oil and gas industries.

It has profoundly changed the nature of our industries and dramatically transformed the supply geography worldwide.

For more than a century, new technologies have changed the way reserves are identified, developed and produced, leading to a massive growth in reserves and supply.

In terms of exploration, technology has improved the quantity and quality of information available about different geological structures.

This has enhanced the likelihood of finding oil and gas, and has extended the reach of surveyors, geologists and explorers into new frontier areas.

Today many new tools allow us to find deeper and harder-to-reach fields.

Part of this has been the result of improvements to sub-surface imaging of deep and complex horizons.

Technology has also been a game-changer in terms of drilling and production.

The successful application of new technologies has literally extended the reach of the industry's drills to ""frontier fields"", allowing drilling and production in harsh environments, and remote and challenging locations.

And new technologies have helped transform resources once thought unconventional into conventional ones.

Remember that only forty years ago, all offshore oil was considered unconventional. Today, this portion of total global oil supply accounts for 30%.

This technology has already spread to other countries like Argentina, China and Poland, increasingly making frontier oil and gas commercially available.

Technological changes have also improved recovery rates and extended the life of existing oil fields. With new technology, old fields - or those considered to be depleted - have been brought back to life.

Of course, today, such techniques - using water, carbon dioxide or other chemicals to improve recovery of oil - are widespread.

These have contributed directly to improved recovery rates.

If new tools and further technological changes can increase recovery rates by several percentage points more, we can assume that we will see more oil - which, combined with new discoveries, will result in tremendous endowment growth and additional supply to consumers.

The impact of technological change on reserve growth and the world's resource base has also been most impressive. This is expected to continue into the future.

According to OPEC's 2010 World Oil Outlook, Member Countries and their reserves have benefitted greatly from technological innovation over the years.

Non-OPEC countries, too, have also witnessed growth in total endowments.

Looking globally, we see similar growth.

Thus, by helping to expand the global resource base of oil and gas, technology has contributed directly to a strengthening of security of supply worldwide.

I should note that technology has also helped reduce the drilling and production costs of oil and gas activities, reducing capital needs and minimizing the risks associated with upstream activities.

Technology has thus not only been a game-changer but also a cost-cutter.

The early development and deployment of new technologies has also helped reduce the industry's environmental footprint.

Although this technology still poses challenges in terms of costs and efficiency, further advances can make it commercially viable - especially if it is combined with targeted R&D efforts and new technological solutions.

Thus, innovations in science and technology mean that fossil fuels can be friendly to the environment.

In closing, let me stress that science, technology and innovation are the key to the continued success of the oil and gas industries. With further innovation, technology may yet help expand oil's role as the world's most affordable and most convenient source of energy.

In-depth scientific and technical research has played a vital role in our industries. It has consistently helped address all sorts of challenges:

Technology offers us a way forward in all these areas.

However, this is not just a matter of going out and buying new technology. We need skilled workers who know how to best use this technology. But the majority of our work-force is aging and growing scarce.

This remains one of the most serious challenges.

We should also remember that given the long-term nature of our industries, R&D efforts require ongoing, timely investments. While we should pay close attention to crude prices in the short-term, we should also be aware of the policies and technological changes in consuming countries that could impact demand levels in the long-term.

This is the delicate, dual nature of the challenge before us all.

But through continued dialogue among Member Countries and greater collaboration on R&D activities, we can attend to this common challenge together - and continue to reach new frontiers in our industry.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/239-1-november-2011.html"
"2011-04-19","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.

Good morning.

I should like to begin by expressing my appreciation to His Excellency Dr Masoud Mir-Kazemi, the Minister of Petroleum of the Islamic Republic of Iran, for the invitation to attend this Ceremony that marks the happy occasion of OPEC’s 50th Anniversary. His Excellency is also President of the Conference of this esteemed producer-group this year, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

I am deeply honoured to be here in Tehran, the capital city of a Founding Member of the Organization.

Fifty years is a proud milestone for any institution. This is especially the case for OPEC, which has achieved a remarkable amount of success since its creation half a century ago. When OPEC was set up, international companies were the dominant force in the oil market, playing the major roles and deriving the greatest benefit from all segments of the business, from exploration to final distribution. Many predicted that the Organization would not last long.

Fifty years on, however, the initial gathering of five oil-producing developing countries has evolved into a solid group of 12 Members. These come from different parts of the world and have brought more strength, vision and diversity to the Organization. This includes its Members gaining full sovereignty over their exhaustible, non-renewable natural resources.

Of course, in 50 years of existence, the Organization has witnessed its fair share of ups and downs. It has, however, adapted to changes, learned many lessons, advanced dialogue and cooperation, been resilient enough to overcome internal and external challenges, and become increasingly proactive and adaptive in the face of dynamic market conditions.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The oil market has been — and will continue to be — an ever-changing arena. This is because oil is so vital to the world economy, it is present in everyone’s daily lives and its market is truly global. After the global financial crisis and economic recession, this past winter has seen a number of significant events that no one could have predicted at the turn of the year. In the Asian region, there has been Japan’s huge earthquake, devastating tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis. Our sympathies go to all those affected by these catastrophic events. And, in North Africa and the Middle East, unrest has been witnessed in a number of countries. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those civilians who have suffered terribly in their daily lives. Where there is still unrest, it is hoped that peaceful solutions can be found soon.

These events, as well as the continued uncertainties surrounding the global economy, have obviously had an impact on oil and energy markets. However, oil markets — which, as I have said, are global in nature — have adjusted rapidly, in terms of both volume and quality. Consequently, and as OPEC has indicated many times, there is no shortage of oil anywhere in the world. Moreover, stock-levels remain high; OPEC’s spare capacity is around 4.5 million barrels a day, even after the recent disruptions; the refining system has adequate flexibility; and the Organization’s current production is at the level it was in December.

Nonetheless, we have all seen prices rising in the first quarter and speculator activity on the Nymex has surged to record highs. For example, by mid-March, open interest for Nymex WTI exceeded the unprecedented level of 1.5 million futures contracts — this is 18 times higher than the daily traded physical crude. Such an increase has been the result of concern about supply deteriorating further beyond the current situation.

The price rises have been even more pronounced at the consumer end, where the effects of taxation in these countries have been felt greatly. OPEC has played its role by ensuring that the market remains well-supplied with crude. And so it would be helpful at this challenging time if consuming countries, that have high levels of tax on oil products, consider revising down these levels — at least temporarily — to alleviate the impact on end-consumers.

These are exceptional circumstances that need exceptional remedies.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

These recent market challenges are typical of those faced by OPEC over the past half century. We have a long record of rising to such challenges, as they affect the international oil market, and overcoming them.

In fact, OPEC itself started out as a challenge! In September 1960, our Organization began as a group of five oil-producing developing countries whose domestic oil sectors were dominated by powerful outside interests. We received only minimal financial returns from sales of our crude on world markets.

The founding of OPEC was a commitment based upon the need of these countries to safeguard their legitimate national interests and to ensure order and stability in the international oil market. This included gaining full sovereignty over their exhaustible, non-renewable natural resources.

Today, as a group of 12 independent sovereign states, we are recognised as a mature, responsible member of the international energy community.

We are also recognised for the constructive way we respond to crises in the market, benefiting all parties. Our agreement of December 2008 is a case in point. This was taken at a time when the oil price was plummeting, as financial institutions were collapsing and the world economy was sliding into recession. The agreement, however, helped stabilise the market at a challenging time, for the benefit of all stakeholders.

But we are not just concerned with the oil market. We also address other major challenges affecting mankind. The establishment of the OPEC Fund for International Development in 1976, of course, is a prime example of our Organization addressing the issue of poverty.

More recently, in 2007, the Third Summit of OPEC Heads of State and Government referred to three guiding themes for the ‘economic, energy and environmental endeavours’ of OPEC and its Member Countries: stability of global energy markets; energy for sustainable development; and energy and environment.

We also recognise that the oil industry is now operating in an interdependent world. This is why we go to great lengths to encourage dialogue and cooperation. OPEC’s involvement in the high-level international producer-consumer dialogue is an example of this. So too are the separate energy dialogues we have established with the European Union, Russia, China and institutions such as the International Energy Agency and the International Monetary Fund.

This is all in the interests of stable, secure oil markets and the receipt of steady petroleum revenue. This helps us develop our economies and provide a better life for our people.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

As a Founder Member of our Organization, Iran has been a key player in OPEC’s achievements throughout its history.

It was directly involved in the formative stages, which date back to as long ago as 1949, when the first approaches were made to set up a producer institution.

And May 1991 saw some important preliminary steps taken at the Isfahan International Conference in the direction of high-level producer-consumer dialogue — this started a process that led to the creation of the International Energy Forum.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

On such occasions as this 50th Anniversary Ceremony, we recall the vision and the resolve of our five founding fathers to create an oil industry that was fairer, more stable and more truly representative of global interests. They were: Dr Fuad Rouhani, from our host nation today; Dr Tala’at al-Shaibani from Iraq; Ahmed Sayed Omar from Kuwait; Abdullah Al-Tariki from Saudi Arabia; and Dr Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo from Venezuela. I believe that, were they alive today, these distinguished gentlemen would have been proud of OPEC’s achievements.

The dedication and commitment of the Governments of our Member Countries have been central to this during the past 50 remarkable years.

At the same time, however, we must not lose sight of the future.

As a group of producers with 80 per cent of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, we are confident of rising to the new challenges — in support of our own domestic development, as well as sound world economic growth. And the Islamic Republic of Iran, without any doubt, will continue to play a key role in this.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/240-19-april-2011.html"
"2011-04-18","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I would like to begin by thanking His Excellency Sheikh Ahmad Al-Abdullah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah for the invitation to participate in this Roundtable. It gives me great pleasure to be in Kuwait, a founding Member of OPEC.

The first quarter of 2011 has seen a number of significant events that none could have predicted at the turn of the year.

In the Asian region, there was Japan’s huge earthquake, devastating tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis. Our sympathies are with all those affected by these catastrophic events.

And in North Africa and the Middle East, unrest has been witnessed in a number of countries. Our thoughts and hearts are with all those civilians who have suffered tremendously and whose daily lives have been adversely impacted. Where unrest remains, it is hoped that peaceful solutions can be found.

These events, as well as the continued uncertainties surrounding the global economy, have obviously had an impact on oil and energy markets. However, oil markets, which are global in nature, have rapidly adjusted, both in terms of volume and quality. Consequently, and as OPEC has indicated many times, there is no shortage of oil anywhere in the world, even with the partial absence of production from one of OPEC’s Member Countries. Moreover, stock levels remain high; OPEC’s spare capacity is around 4.5 million barrels a day, even after the recent disruption; the refining system has adequate flexibility; and the Organization’s current production is at the level it was in December.

Nonetheless, we have all seen prices increasing in the first quarter and speculator activity on the Nymex has surged to record highs. For example, by mid-March, open interest for the Nymex WTI exceeded the unprecedented level of 1.5 million futures contracts, which is 18 times higher than the daily traded physical crude. Such an increase has been the result of concerns on supply further deteriorating beyond the current situation. A risk premium of about 15 to 20 dollars is currently embedded in the price.

It is important the market focuses on its balanced supply and demand fundamentals. A curb in speculative activities is needed. None of us want a return to the price levels we witnessed in mid-2008.

The rise in prices has been even more pronounced at the consumer end, where the effect of consuming country taxation is greatly felt. While OPEC has played its role by ensuring the market remains well supplied in crude, it would be helpful at this point in time if consuming countries that have a high level of taxation on oil products consider revising down these levels, at least temporarily, to alleviate the impact on end-consumers.

These are exceptional circumstances that need exceptional remedies.

Looking to the longer term and the theme of this session – ‘Asian Energy Outlook up to 2030’ – what is clear is that the Asian region has become, and will increasingly become, ever more important in terms of global economic growth and energy demand. This is highlighted in last November’s publication of OPEC’s annual World Oil Outlook.

First, in terms of demographics: Asia is home to two-thirds of the world’s population, a population that is young, growing quickly and increasingly located in large urban areas.

In terms of the economy, Asia’s role and its global weight is rapidly expanding: today, it contributes 36% of the world’s gross domestic product and this share is expected to reach 49% by 2030. Asia will economically be the fastest growing region over the next 20 years.

This economic strength can also be viewed in the region’s recovery from the global economic crisis. Emerging economies, with China and India to the fore, are now back to strong growth rates. This is in contrast to many OECD countries that are juggling the need for additional monetary and fiscal policies to support fragile growth and the necessity for fiscal consolidation. This is particularly evident in the sovereign debt situations of a number of Euro-zone countries.

This expected economic growth also translates into Asia’s expanding importance for energy demand, in general, and oil demand, in particular. In fact, the hub for oil demand has been progressively shifting towards Asia in recent years. For example, over the last five years, OECD oil demand contracted by around 3.8 million barrels a day. While Asia, including the Middle East, actually saw an increase of almost 4.8 million barrels a day over the same period.

Looking ahead, developing countries are set to account for most of the long-term oil demand increase, with consumption rising 22 million barrels a day over the period 2009-to-2030 to reach almost 57 million barrels a day. And around 75% of the net growth in oil demand in this period is in developing Asian economies.

It is clear that transportation will remain the main source of the region’s oil demand growth. With strong economic expansion, improvements in living standards and greater disposable incomes, a significant increase in vehicle volumes for Asia’s developing countries is expected. Today, 22% of world passenger cars are in Asia; this figure is projected to reach 39% in 2030. This represents phenomenal growth.

It should be noted, however, that per capita oil use in developing countries will remain far below that of the developed world by 2030. For example, oil use per person in North America will still be more than ten times that in South Asia.

Moreover, energy poverty will remain a very real concern for many billions of people, the majority of whom are to be found in Asia.

Of course, the region’s growing energy use can be expected to result in higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. It is important, however, to put this in context.

This is specifically in terms of sustainable development, with its intertwined and mutually supportive pillars of economic development, social progress and the protection of the environment. And in regards to priorities and responsibilities, with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change stating that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing country Parties. Developed countries should take the lead in combating climate change and the subsequent adverse effects.

Nonetheless, it should be stressed that many Asian countries are already playing a role in reducing their economy’s carbon intensity.

For example, China’s recent five-year plan calls for a drastic reduction in both energy consumption and CO2 emission per unit of GDP, by 16 and 17% respectively, by the end of 2015. And many countries in the region are also seeing a significant expansion in renewables, albeit from a low base.

There has also been much talk of nuclear in recent years, with a number of countries in the region looking to build nuclear plants. Events at the Fukushima nuclear complex in Japan, however, have led to many questions being asked about nuclear power, particularly in terms of safety, waste and decommissioning.

From an oil market perspective, for fast-growing Asian economies it is important that there is adequate supply to meet the growing demand. This is clear, both in terms of production and available resources.

While suppliers continue to face significant challenges, such as the impact of the global financial and economic crisis, market volatility and the role of speculation, and an often unclear demand picture as a result of a number of consuming countries policies, investments to increase capacity are being made.

In the medium-term to 2015, OPEC Member Countries are expected to invest an estimated $290 billion in upstream projects, with $120 billion in Iraq alone. We remain committed to future investment plans to boost our capacity.

Resources are also plentiful. The Middle East alone has an abundant natural resource endowment: over 750 billion barrels in proven crude oil reserves and almost 76 trillion cubic metres in proven gas reserves, which is around 56% and 40% of global totals, respectively.

What all this underlines is the ever-expanding interdependence between the Middle East and Asian regions. This is not only in terms of oil trade, which continues to grow, but also from a broader economic perspective. For example, between 2000 and 2009, exports to the Middle East from Asia and the Far East increased by around 300%, compared to an increase of about 120% in terms of total world exports from Asia and the Far East. Exports from the Middle East to Asia and the Far East also increased around 180%, compared to a global figure of about 145%.

In looking at Asia’s future energy outlook, it is clear that the relationship between this region and the Middle East is an extremely important one and one which will continue to grow. There is much that each can offer the other.

In general, the growing interdependence between us is all the more clear today given that many regions and countries are facing an array of challenges, such as those originating from economic and financial uncertainties, natural disasters and domestic social unrest.

With this in mind, our goal must be one of stability, with a clear and consistent environment that enables the industry to continue to develop, produce, transport, refine and deliver energy in an efficient and economic manner. This will benefit producers and consumers, as well as present and future generations, and hopefully deliver a better standard of living for all peoples around the world, as well as a greater hope that tomorrow will be better than today.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/241-18-april-2011.html"
"2011-02-22","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It gives me great pleasure to be here today to recognize the significant work that has been undertaken this past year by experts from the IEF, the IEA and OPEC in implementing the Cancun Ministerial Declaration, and to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the producer-consumer dialogue that started in Paris in 1991. This follows our own major milestone last year: OPEC's 50th Anniversary.

The IEF has come a long way in the past 20 years. Those early ad-hoc meetings of producers and consumers have now been replaced by more focused workshops and ministerial forums. At the same time, however, the informal nature of the dialogue has remained. The IEF now has its own Secretariat, here in Riyadh, which is also home to the important JODI initiative. Following the Cancun Declaration, we have witnessed, over the past year, the formulation of an IEF Charter and the development of agreed activities between the IEF, the IEA and OPEC.

OPEC is proud to have played a role in all this. We appreciate the informal nature of the dialogue and, over the years, have actively contributed to ideas and analysis, as well as the exchange of views between various stakeholders.

The IEF's informal producer-consumer dialogue has become an essential ingredient to ensure market stability, improve transparency and provide greater predictability. The focus must be on understanding the needs of each stakeholder and viewing the entire energy market holistically. In an increasingly interdependent world, the importance of such needs cannot be overstated. It is crucial to remember that energy security is a two-way street. Security of demand is as important to producers as security of supply is to consumers. The two need to go hand-in-hand.

It is also important to continue working towards ensuring access of the poor to modern energy services: isn't it unacceptable that, today, 1.5 billion people have no access to electricity and that 2.6 billion still continue to rely on traditional biomass for cooking?

Today's Extraordinary Meeting underscores some of the benefits associated with the dialogue, which are a direct result of the Cancun Ministerial Declaration. As I have already mentioned, the Declaration, itself put together taking into account inputs and viewpoints from a variety of stakeholders, identified a number of areas for cooperation between the IEF, the IEA and OPEC.

From OPEC's perspective, we are pleased to see that these words and recommendations have been turned into concrete actions. This includes joint activities and reports concerning the linkages between physical and financial markets, energy market regulation and energy market trends and outlooks. The results of these activities you will hear about today.

I would also like to stress that it is essential we continue to work toward the proper and full implementation of the agreed upon areas of cooperation. Our efforts should be dedicated to this, so that we can fully achieve what was laid out in the Cancun Ministerial Declaration.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

The IEF has already shown how the producer-consumer dialogue can help the industry meet some of the challenges it faces head on, specifically by bringing people and organizations together. We have nothing to lose but we have a lot to gain from dialogue and OPEC remains fully committed to this path.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/242-22-february-2011.html"
"2011-02-22","Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,

It gives me pleasure today to talk briefly about OPEC's role in the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI).

OPEC is proud to have played a role in the establishment of JODI in 2001 and we continue to fully support the Initiative. We see JODI as one of the most visible manifestation of the producer-consumer dialogue and welcome its contribution to sharing data and information in an efficient manner.

In the ten years since it was formed, JODI has expanded significantly with more than 90 countries currently participating, including all OPEC Member Countries. Alongside this, there have been substantial improvements in the accuracy, timeliness and transparency of data. This has been made possible through the dedication and untiring efforts of the organizations involved.

Thus far, one of the most important achievements of the Initiative was the release of the JODI World Database to the public in 2005. OPEC and its Member Countries fully supported this decision, and I think this move has been instrumental in helping make JODI what it is today: a respected global initiative advancing the transparency and flows of global energy market data and one that has been positively recognized by energy stakeholders.

OPEC and it Member Countries, who dedicate a significant amount of resources to the Initiative, view the improvement of timeliness, coverage and reliability in the JODI database as the top priority.

Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,

Global challenges require a global commitment. With this in mind, the JODI community is demonstrating that the global oil data transparency challenge can, step-by-step, be effectively addressed. And it has also shown that the producer-consumer dialogue is about concrete action.

Finally, let me reiterate that JODI has OPEC's full support. We hope the Initiative will go from strength-to-strength in harmonizing global energy statistics and enhancing dialogue.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/243-22-february-2011.html"
"2011-01-31","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Ladies and gentlemen: good morning.

It's my pleasure to be here once again to talk about the Middle East and North Africa, one of the most dynamic regions of the world.

MENA countries are rich in natural resources. They have growing, young and educated populations and are expected to take their share of world GDP growth now and into the future. The region is also home to eight of OPEC's twelve Member Countries, which provide significant quantities of the world's oil and gas supplies.

However, these countries - like many other countries which are endowed with natural resources - face difficulties over whether to invest in their oil and gas, and produce now or postpone investment to a later date. Not only do they have to address ongoing economic and social development aspirations but they also have to consider how to meet global demand for oil and gas.

Before I proceed, I would like to touch on the current situation in the oil market.

I can understand that consumers are concerned about recent oil price developments. I'd like to emphasise that OPEC has no interest in very high oil prices. We are watching the oil market very closely and we see that WTI is close to 85 Dollars per barrel and Brent is around 95 Dollars per barrel. First of all, it is not usual for Brent to be priced higher than WTI. In 2010, the average price for WTI was higher than it was for Brent. So this is clearly due to technical factors and has nothing to do with market fundamentals.

While we are focussing on the oil price, I would like to reiterate that the oil market currently has more than enough oil to meet current demand. Global inventories are high. Forward cover is close to 60 days, which means that it is six to seven days above the five-year average. Our Member Countries are producing 29.3 million barrels per day and also collectively hold spare capacity of a very healthy 6 million barrels per day. Consequently, we do not see any shortage of oil in the market.

Now I will return to the subject which I am here to discuss with you today.

Resource Endowments

MENA countries have abundant natural resource endowments. With 820 billion barrels in proven crude oil reserves and 83 trillion cubic metres in proven gas reserves, this is about 61 per cent and 44 per cent of global totals, respectively.

For most of these countries, oil and gas also form the backbone of their economies and trade. In 2009, for example, oil alone accounted for more than 21 per cent of their combined GDP and represented 60 per cent of total exports.

Striking the Right Balance

Having great natural resource endowments brings with it great benefits - and even greater responsibilities and challenges. OPEC's Member Countries understand this and are dedicated to market stability. That is why OPEC is committed to continuous investment and ensuring more supply to the world's oil markets.

As you are all aware, OPEC's Secretariat advises its members on the outlook for the oil market - in the short-, medium- and long-term. Investments are a Member Country driven approach. However, there are a couple of scenarios that any oil-producing nation may face.

In general, the oil and gas industry, due to its long-lead times and capital-intensive nature, has to strike a careful balance so as to avoid both under-investing and over-investing. Balance is needed between meeting the requirements of the oil market and addressing a country's own development needs.

One scenario could be for a producing country to not depend solely on oil and gas as its main source of revenue and, consequently, leave the majority of these resources in the ground. Of course, the risk is that if there is any unexpected supply crunch, the country may not be able and ready to meet a possible shortfall. Oil producers have experienced this situation before.

The other scenario could be for a country to focus strongly on upstream investments - with the goal of expanding capacity and generating more money, despite its needs.

But if upstream investments are pursued without a careful consideration of global market conditions, the result could be a higher risk of idle spare capacity - and unnecessary costs to maintain this. This is one of several risks of over-investing. It could also result in damage to existing oil fields if consideration is not given to reservoir conditions, which could lead to faster-than-anticipated decline rates.

In the longer-term, over-investment in capacity could end up generating massive revenues, which would then have to be channelled elsewhere. A country could very well deposit these revenues in banks or other investment schemes, but these are subject to continual risks of fluctuation, low interest rates and volatility.

If a country is unable to absorb an inflow of revenues, those financial resources could very well end up being spent on unnecessary large-scale, big-ticket projects - so-called ""white elephants"".

In my opinion - and let me stress that this is my personal opinion - one must invest according to the needs of one's country and the capability of one's resources. By leaving unneeded resources in the ground, one is catering for future generations.

Current Investments

Investments are the lifeblood of the oil and gas industry. They are the key for meeting future demand and are therefore too important to be approached without much thought and planning. Simply put, one has to anticipate the economic cycle. Again, the key to this is a balanced approach.

OPEC has consistently said in recent times that prices are disconnected from the physical oil markets and are increasingly subject to paper markets. Consequently, the market is dominated by financial players, which is misleading when it comes to understanding the behaviour of the oil market.

Yet, despite all of the difficulties which our Member Countries are facing, and as I have said on numerous occasions, we remain committed to future investment plans to boost our capacity.

In the medium-term, we are investing an estimated 155 billion Dollars in projects across our Member Countries. The timeframe for these projects to come on stream, is between 2010 and 2014. These projects will add around 12 million barrels per day of gross production capacity.

OPEC is continually reviewing the status of these, and other projects. In fact, a new updated report on investment projects in our Member Countries can be expected in March.

In addition to investing in upstream projects, some of our Member Countries are also investing in downstream projects. These projects - both at home and abroad - are estimated at close to 40 billion Dollars.

Let me turn for a moment to natural gas. The capital investment requirements for the gas industry seem to have recovered from contractions since the recent financial crisis. Actual natural gas investments (in expanded capacity, production and transportation) will amount to about 167 billion Dollars to 2015 across the MENA region. A majority of these investments will be in OPEC Member Countries.

In addition, close to 39 trillion cubic metres of gas reserves remain as yet to be discovered in MENA countries.

But there are two important pre-requisites: demand security and stable prices. Without these, investment plans lose their rationale.

Allow me to address these in turn.

Security of Demand

Sound, long-term investments thrive on certainty and predictability and what we have always called security of demand. But there are numerous challenges to this.

On the economic front, the recent crisis has added an element of uncertainty to oil demand. Despite signs of a recovery, doubts still persist over the medium- and long-term prospects for economic growth. And looking towards the long-term, it is difficult to gauge the strength of recovery between regions and within sectors. This means that different paths could emerge for crude required by OPEC.

For instance, OPEC's higher growth scenario sees demand rising by around 44 million barrels per day to 2030. However, the lower growth scenario sees demand for OPEC crude as low as 28 million barrels per day for the same period.

Investments in the industry also depend on clear, accurate and timely data - about production and supplies, about upstream and downstream activities, and about existing contracts and projects. For that kind of data, we need increased transparency on the part of all energy stakeholders - and oil consumers everywhere.

And with growing oil demand from emerging markets around the world, data from those parts of the world is increasingly important. That is a challenge that has yet to be addressed.

Enabling Price Environment

The other aspect needed to ensure the continuity of investments is having an enabling and stable price environment. This means having prices at a reasonable level and without extreme fluctuations. Prices that are extreme in either direction, whether too high or too low, can be detrimental to investment plans.

We in the industry have seen periods of both record high and low prices - most recently in 2008. That experience reminded all of us - producers and consumers alike - that extreme price volatility benefits no one.

I'd like to remind you all that fossil fuels will remain the dominant source of energy for the foreseeable future. There is no doubt that other sources of energy will grow. But that growth will be from a low base.

And I am certain that all of you will agree with me when I say that our industry is facing enormous challenges - such as climate change, manpower shortages, technological changes. Therefore, it is a good opportunity for IOCs and NOCs to cooperate with each other to overcome these and any new difficulties which we may face.

Concluding Remarks

Balance is particularly important to upstream investment plans, especially given an environment like today's, which remains risky, uncertain and somewhat unpredictable. Oil-producers are thus constantly assessing these conditions as they make their investment plans, guided by an over-arching concern for balance.

OPEC Member Countries know that to make the necessary investments at the right time, they have to consider many inter-related factors - the return-on-investments, capital costs, price levels, GDP growth and aggregate demand. They have so far been able to achieve a balance in their investments plans - and, in the process, have ensured the stability of the market.

But the key, as we have said in the past, is to continue to find ways for producers and consumers to work together to ensure a lasting stability - not just for the investment plans of producers, but for the benefit of consumers and the continuing growth of all energy stakeholders. This is our global task.

Thank you for your kind attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/244-31-january-2011.html"
"2010-12-10","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​In Bali in 2007, we all agreed to urgently enhance and enable the full, effective and sustained implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. And equally important is the objective of agreeing on further commitments for Annex-I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol.

​Last year in Copenhagen, little progress was achieved; a clear demonstration that a successful outcome can only be achieved through an open, inclusive, transparent and country-driven process.

​I would like to thank the Mexican Presidency for its untiring efforts to ensure such transparency and openness.

​OPEC Member Countries have positively and constructively engaged in these climate change negotiations, cognizant that the protection of the environment is an important pillar of sustainable development, along with economic growth and social progress.

​Here in Cancun, they are actively engaged in efforts to reach a fair, comprehensive and equitable agreement under each of the negotiation tracks. We believe that collective efforts could lead to a successful outcome, provided that the principles and the provisions of the Convention are fully taken into account and respected. In particular, the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as the overriding priority of economic and social development and the eradication of poverty.

​In this regard, it is important to underline the role of developed countries. They should take the lead in combating climate change given their historical responsibility and in providing new, adequate and predictable financial resources and technology transfer to support developing country mitigation actions, as well as adaptation to both climate change and the adverse effects of response measures.

​All of OPEC’s Members are developing countries, all are Parties to the Convention, and all play a vital role in supplying energy that helps satisfy the world’s needs. They invest huge financial resources to ensure security of supply to consumers, including investing in spare capacity. It is a responsibility we take very seriously. 

​However, OPEC Member Countries are also heavily dependent on the production and export of an exhaustible, non-renewable natural resource. They are highly vulnerable not only to climate change, but also to the adverse impacts of response measures on their economies and on their citizens.

​OPEC Member Countries interests need to be safeguarded.

​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​We need to remember the spirit in which we agreed the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol. It was a spirit that allowed for everyone’s issues to be taken aboard. We must continue this process of inclusivity.

​We need win-win solutions that do not discriminate against one Party or another.

​We need to rely on all available cost effective abatement technologies, including cleaner fossil fuel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage.

​We need to give more prominence to those means that allow for a satisfactory balance between mitigation and development, such as the Clean Development Mechanism.

​We need to satisfactorily address, including through funding, the issue of adaptation to climate change, as well as to the adverse impacts of response measures. 

​This is all possible. And we all know how it can be achieved.

​It is through a collective and cooperative process that allows us to reach a fair and equitable outcome for all. If this is the way forward, then I feel we can together reach a balanced outcome here in Cancun and we can continue working constructively in the future to meet the challenge of climate change. And let us be assured that OPEC Member Countries will spare no effort in this regard.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/245-10-december-2010.html"
"2010-11-25","Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to be here this evening representing the Secretary General of OPEC, HE Abdalla Salem El-Badri. And on his behalf, I would like to thank the Oil Council for the invitation to address this respected gathering.

As each and everyone one of us in this industry knows, the last few years have been hugely challenging. I certainly do not need to remind anyone here of the turbulent journey the world economy has gone through. Nor do you need reminding of the belt-tightening measures that have been implemented by most governments over the last two years. All intended to put the economy back on the path of growth.

It has been a momentous and unpredictable time. And we still face many hurdles and challenges. Yet, there is still good reason to look ahead with optimism.

If I may, I would like to touch briefly on the background to the crisis.

The global financial crisis and subsequent economic downturn of 2008-2009 were very severe. The crisis had its foundation firmly rooted in the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States as well as the activities of speculators. The oil market was severely affected by these developments and the result was a roller-coaster ride for oil prices. The OPEC Reference Basket recorded prices in 2008, that were both extremely high at $141/b and as low at $33/b. Inevitably, this did not create a good investment climate. Consequently, projects were either delayed or suspended in both OPEC and non-OPEC Member Countries, as governments worked to find ways to put the economy back on track. The latter, as we know, has been largely through the monetary and fiscal stimulus packages implemented across the globe - which have certainly helped economies return to growth.

For its part, OPEC's decision to adjust production by 4.2million b/d at its Conference in Oran, Algeria in 2008 went a long way in helping to stabilize the oil market.

Trying to put the crisis behind us, we entered 2010 with optimism.

As we all know, a stable economy is an essential requirement for growth and investment for both energy producers and consumers. For now, most analysts are of the opinion that the worst of the global financial crisis and subsequent economic downturn is almost behind us. Also, with the price of oil remaining relatively stable at a range of $70-85/barrel this year, the economic outlook appears far brighter than it did a year or so ago.

And, as the world economy continues to recover, most of the investments affected as a result of the crisis have been resumed. In OPEC Member Countries for instance, according to our forecast, over the period to 2014 there are around 140 projects expected to come on stream. These will result in gross capacity of 12mbd by the end of 2014. The estimated required investment is around $155 billion over the same period.

Of course looking ahead there are future challenges.

Now, the question is, can we also approach 2011 with the same level of optimism as we did 2010 or do we have cause to be wary?

Ladies and gentlemen, the future seems to be fraught with challenges and evidence of a newly emerging crisis point to the need for cautious optimism.

But make no mistake there is and will continue to be demand for crude oil. In our World Oil Outlook for 2010 released earlier this month, the forecast showed that developing countries and South East Asia in particular, are fast becoming the centre of gravity of global economic growth. And therefore of energy needs! Most importantly, the forecast also shows that it is necessary to increase fossil fuels use, in particular oil, to meet future energy demand most of which will come from these regions.

While this is the situation, it is important to also note that there are present realities that may affect demand in the years ahead, especially over the immediate future. When we talk about economic recovery, the nature of such a recovery has not been as balanced as many would have preferred. The recovery, and growth in oil demand, is being fuelled by the emerging markets of non-OECD countries.

Growth meanwhile, in some of the industrialized countries has been lethargic. This has raised fears of a double dip recession. In the OECD - particularly in the European Union - there is concern about ""sovereign debt sustainability"". And the early reduction of financial stimulus packages around the world continues to present significant challenges.

Also, there is genuine concern over rising unemployment worldwide. This is in addition to a possible overheating of the Chinese economy and continuing global imbalances. These have led to calls for countries enjoying some level of economic boom to actively encourage private consumption to bring the world economy out of recession.

Then, of course, there are new challenges that include the Irish debt crisis - the second for the Euro zone in 6 months, the weak dollar and also energy policies of some consumer countries that set ambitious targets for some fuel types, such as biofuels at the detriment of oil. The danger in this is that as we all know, lead times for investment are very long in this industry, and it is a complex and ongoing challenge to avoid over- or under-investing.

In other words, there is the need for clear non-discriminatory policy directives that would point investors in the right direction.

Another challenge that we have to deal with to ensure stable supply in the future, is that of the availability of suitably trained manpower. It is important to remember that the training, education and retention of skilled labour are fundamental to the future health of the OUR industry.

As we approach 2011, if these challenges are not well handled, they have the capacity to erode the gains made in 2010. How we handle them therefore will affect the pace of recovery and demand in 2011.

Let me now please talk of OPEC's commitment.

For our part, OPEC remains committed to its goal of providing steady supplies of crude to the market at all times. As you may be aware, OPEC celebrated its 50th Anniversary on 14 September, of this year. Fifty years on - I am proud to say that in ensuring steady and secure oil supply , OPEC has remained faithful to the objective that was agreed by its Founder Members - Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela at its first conference in Baghdad in 1960.

In addition, the Organization has supported market stability, encouraged sustainable development initiatives through the OPEC Fund for International Development and committed itself to efforts to protect the environment. We are also strongly committed to encouraging dialogue between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as with consumers.

In the area of adequate manpower provision, it is encouraging to see that our Member Countries have been making increasing efforts to provide appropriate education and training to industry personnel. Globally, however, a lot more thought has to be given to this area just as more needs to be done to ensure that the industry does not run out of skilled manpower in the future.

And on that note ladies and gentlemen, I thank you all for your time. And please enjoy the rest of your evening.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/246-25-november-2010.html"
"2010-11-08","Ladies and gentlemen,

It gives me great pleasure to engage with such an important forum on behalf of the OPEC Secretary General, HE Abdalla Salem El-Badri. I would like to thank the organisers of this event for the opportunity.

The overall theme of the 7th Vienna Economic Forum emphasises the growing importance of South East Europe, a vibrant region of the world that, although currently going through a rough patch as we heard from the distinguished speakers earlier today, has enormous potential for growth. Yet at the global level the trend of going South East is even more pronounced.

Indeed, OPEC's most recent forecast, published in our just released World Oil Outlook 2010, shows that developing countries and South East Asia in particular are fast becoming the centre of gravity of global economic growth, and therefore of energy needs.

Our forecast also shows that it is necessary to increase fossil fuels use, in particular oil, to meet future energy demand. In this connection, it should be emphasised that the world has enough oil resources to meet demand for decades to come. Let me stress that OPEC remains committed to ensuring the market is adequately supplied at all times, in an efficient, timely, sustainable, economic, reliable and environmentally-sound manner. OPEC Member Countries are willing to make the required investment to achieve that goal, but it is crucial to appreciate that when talk turns to investment there are a number of factors that need to be taken into account. This leads me to the second part of my speech.

For energy producers and consumers alike, a stable economy is an essential requirement. The global financial crisis and subsequent economic downturn of 2008-2009 have had a sharp impact on the oil market. Global oil demand declined for two consecutive years, a situation not seen since the early 1980s, and oil prices have experienced a roller-coaster ride. The OPEC Reference Basket rose to a record $141/b in early July 2008 before falling to $33/b by the end of the year.

Due to unexpectedly low oil prices in late 2008 and early 2009 as the global economic downturn took hold, OPEC Member Countries had no choice but to delay a number of their planned investment projects. However, by now, most of these projects have either been resumed or rescheduled. Over the period to 2014 there are around 140 projects expected to come on stream in OPEC Member Countries. These will result in net crude capacity additions of around 3 mb/d by the end of 2014. The estimated required investment is around $155 billion over the same period.

This 'stop-go' situation in terms of investment plans was not experienced by OPEC countries alone; the entire world oil industry faced similar challenges. Economic stability is vital if we are to avoid a repeat of this.

It is understood more clearly now that improved regulation of the financial sector should be at the very centre of a new and more sustainable way forward. It is widely accepted that factors other than the physical fundamentals of the oil market played a disproportionately large role in bringing about extreme oil price movement in 2008. Commodities have come to be used as an asset class, and speculation has driven large price swings in a variety of markets. Such volatility must be minimised. In this regard, we follow regulatory developments in the US and Europe with keen interest and any positive outcomes of these efforts will be welcomed.

In 2009, global gross domestic product was estimated to have declined by 0.8%, although in the latter part of 2009, and especially in the first half of 2010, global economic growth exceeded expectations. Most analysts believe that the worst of the Great Recession is over. The stimulus packages implemented in many countries have clearly been instrumental supporting a return to growth.

Nevertheless, there are several factors that could significantly hinder the recovery. Concerns remain about the uneven nature of growth. While emerging markets are leading global growth, some industrialised countries are growing more sluggishly, and the risk of a double dip recession remains. In the OECD - particularly in the European Union - there is concern about sovereign debt sustainability. And the premature tapering off of financial stimulus packages around the world continues to present considerable challenges. In addition, concerns relating to high levels of unemployment worldwide, the possible overheating of the Chinese economy and persistent global imbalances remain. In line with this, there are calls for countries enjoying surpluses to play their part by encouraging private consumption to support global reflation.

Ladies and gentlemen,

When we talk of the challenges and responsibility for a stable economy, it is important to stress that we live in an increasingly complex and interdependent world. This means that everybody has a responsibility to support a return to balanced and sustainable economic growth.

This complex world has energy at its heartbeat. OPEC's recent Conference decisions - as well as other initiatives outlined above - prove that the Organization takes its responsibilities seriously.

We take pride in working hard to support stability. We firmly believe that oil prices should remain at levels that will both encourage continued investment in the oil industry and support a return to a healthy, balanced economy.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/247-8-november-2010.html"
"2010-10-20","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Good morning.

I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to His Excellency Ali I. Al-Naimi, Minister of Petroleum & Mineral Resources of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for the invitation to speak at this International Energy Symposium, and my sincere thanks to the Chair of this session, His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman Al-Saud. It is a great honour for me to participate in this event; one that marks the happy occasion of the 50th Anniversary of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Fifty years ago, when OPEC was set up in Baghdad, there were some who predicted that the Organization would not last long. Fifty years on, however, that initial small group of developing oil producing countries has evolved into a group of twelve. These come from across the world and have brought more strength and diversity to the Organization.

It has certainly not been an easy task to advance the Organization's standing and influence, particularly given the nature of the oil industry at the time of its establishment. As I am sure you are all aware, the main catalyst for its birth came in 1959, when a group of international oil companies - the Seven Sisters - unilaterally reduced the posted prices of the crude they supplied.

At that time, these international companies were the dominant force in the oil market, playing the major roles and deriving the greatest benefits from all segments of the business, from exploration to final distribution. They controlled the quantity of oil extracted and sold, to whom it was sold, and at what price. And decisions were made without ever consulting host Governments of oil-producing countries.

So in 1960, five oil-producing developing countries - Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela - came together around the premise of cooperation. They have since been joined by Qatar, Libya, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Nigeria, Ecuador and Angola.

The founding of OPEC was a commitment based upon the need to safeguard their legitimate national interests and to ensure order and stability in the international oil market. It was about gaining the full sovereignty over their exhaustible non-renewable natural resources.

Over the years, this cooperation has grown stronger as the Organization has evolved and become an established and respected member of the global energy community. In the years ahead, OPEC's dedication to the welfare of its Member Countries, the international energy market and the global economy will of course continue.

This very brief history underlines the importance OPEC attaches to cooperation and dialogue. It was an essential part of its founding, has been fundamental to its evolution, and will be a key element in the Organization's future.

Of course, the issue of cooperation is central to the main topic I have been asked to talk about today: 'The Relationship between OPEC and other International Organizations'.

OPEC has long recognized the importance of adopting a plurilateral approach to addressing major topical issues, involving dialogue and cooperation with other international organizations and interested parties. This applies to both direct oil industry matters, as well as related areas, such as environmental protection and sustainable development.

At first, however, OPEC found it difficult, if not impossible, to establish dialogue and start cooperation outside of OPEC circles. This is due mainly to the hostile environment that prevailed when OPEC was born.

Gradually this changed. And there was a coming together and an understanding that in many respects our interests, particularly in regard to market stability, were, if not identical, at least similar. We have come a long way, from the early confrontation to the cooperation we see today.

Today, the importance of dialogue between international organizations, particularly in terms of bringing together producers and consumers, has never been greater. The reason is that globalization, international trade and mass communication are bringing us all closer together. We live in an increasingly interdependent world. This fact was clearly evident during the global financial and economic crisis. The knock-on impacts have been felt in almost all industries and in all countries across the world.

And, with energy central to each and every one of us, it is critical that all stakeholders work together for market stability. This is vital for the effective and efficient functioning of the global energy market.

In the global oil market, while demand for oil is clearly set to grow in the coming years, a number of factors that could have both medium- and long-term impacts on supply exist. This includes the policies of a number of consuming countries that offer an unclear picture of their impact on future oil consumption levels and overall energy demand. There is a need to provide clearer policies that are reliable, predictable and not discriminatory. Market stability is essential for both producers and consumers.

In addition, there is the need for a better understanding of such matters as the effects of excessive market volatility, the role of speculation, the future requirements for human resources as well as the impact of climate change and of mitigation policies and measures.

We should also never forget that it is a world in which energy poverty continues to blight the lives of billions of people. It is an issue that needs the urgent and critical attention of world leaders.

To help meet some of these challenges and uncertainties facing the global oil market, and the world, in general, we at OPEC believe in continually looking to explore and evolve our dialogue and cooperation with other international organizations. We recognize the value of strong and mutually-beneficial relationships.

In this regard, OPEC continues to maintain a strong and positive relationship with the European Union (EU). In the latest EU-OPEC Ministerial Dialogue that took place in June this year, the two organizations highlighted a number of relevant and topical areas where cooperation could be furthered. This included the need to continue to analyze and discuss the root causes of the recent financial crisis and economic recession; to organize roundtables on the challenges facing offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities and the causes of the skilled workforce shortage in the energy and oil industry; and to develop a study to explore the potential of technological advances in transportation.

OPEC and the EU also remain in discussions about enhancing cooperation through the development of an OPEC-EU Technology Centre, with energy technologies identified as one of the most important areas for cooperation.

Cooperation between OPEC and the IEA goes back many years and has advanced considerably. In recent years, a number of joint workshops on a variety of topical issues have been held and both Mr. Tanaka and I have made visits to the headquarters of our respective organizations. OPEC sees the dialogue between the two as an important element in improving the understanding of the concerns of all parties for oil market stability and predictability.

OPEC has also been proud to have played an active part in the formation of the International Energy Forum, whose Secretariat is now located here in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It was founded as a platform that helps informal dialogue between producers and consumers and OPEC continues to support the IEF in providing this function.

This can be seen in the Organization's active participation in the IEF's Joint Oil Data Initiative, set up to enhance the transparency, quality, timeliness and flows of oil market data. We remain committed to furthering this project.

The Cancun Declaration, which was a result of the initiative begun by Saudi Arabia when it held an ad-hoc energy meeting in June 2008, maps out a path for a strengthened IEF, specifically through the development of an IEF Charter. Furthermore, it outlines specific areas of cooperation between the IEF, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and OPEC. This covers present and future market trends; the functioning and regulation of energy markets; and data.

The Organization and its Member Countries have also been, and continue to be, actively involved with many United Nations Organizations. This includes the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development and, of course, the long-standing negotiations within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol.

I think we all appreciate that the climate change negotiations can, at times, feel extremely complex and, on occasion, appear to be never-ending. However, OPEC recognizes the importance of being part of these negotiations and of working with all parties and organizations to develop solutions that safeguard the legitimate interests of all parties.

In this regard, I am sure all stakeholders agree that any future agreement should be balanced, fair and equitable. It needs to take into account the past, present and future; the fulfilling of current commitments and obligations; address the net emissions of all greenhouse gases; use all available cost effective abatement options and technologies, including cleaner fossil fuel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage; and remain focused on the priority of sustainable development, particularly in regard to those least able to help themselves.

Additionally, OPEC has furthered dialogue this past decade with countries such as China, Russia and a number of other non-OPEC producers, as well as with other international organizations, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization.

We also hope to expand our dialogue with other international organizations, as well as countries, such as India and Brazil.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In summing up, let me stress once again that OPEC, in its 50th Anniversary year, remains faithful to the cooperation and the commitments that were agreed in Baghdad 50 years ago; to ensure market stability, an efficient and regular supplies of petroleum to consumers, a steady income to producers, and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/248-20-october-2010.html"
"2010-05-09","Mr Chairman,
Excellencies,
Ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon:

I am delighted to be back in this dynamic and expanding city of Doha and I am deeply honoured to participate on this panel.

I should like to share with you OPEC’s views on recent developments in the energy scene and their impacts. The changes that the energy scene has witnessed over the last few years have been dramatic. They stem from two main causes: the global financial crisis, and the subsequent economic downturn, and the inefficient functioning of oil markets in terms of price discovery.

The financial crisis, which began in the summer 2007 and reached its height in September 2008 with the near collapse of the global financial system, has had a profound impact on the real economy. The world has faced its longest, deepest and most-widespread contraction in more than six decades.

This, in turn, adversely affected the energy sector.

The years 2008 and 2009 were the first time since 1981 that global oil demand declined in two successive years. The cumulative impact was a fall of 1.8 million barrels a day. The price of a barrel of crude lost almost 100 dollars in less than six months from mid‐2008. The demand for OPEC crude fell sharply and the resulting supply adjustment by OPEC Member Countries led to a significant increase in unused production capacity. Today, this figure is 6 million barrels a day.

Natural gas demand also declined, at a time when conventional and unconventional gas supplies were increasing, which led to a sharp downward trend in gas prices.

The financial crisis, the economic downturn and lower petroleum prices have had visible adverse effects on Arab Countries. This has been through many channels, such as trade, declines in the value of stock markets and investments portfolios values and lower economic growth. It has shown how deeply interconnected these economies are with the rest of the world. It underlines the need for even more diversified economies and the importance of policies to mitigate the effects of economic cycles and volatility in commodity markets.

Yet we should also remember that while there is a richness and diversity about the economic culture of the Arab world, in both the traditional and modern sectors, it is an undeniable fact that a viable petroleum industry provides an important economic stimulus for the area as a whole.

Regarding oil exports revenues, the crisis demonstrated once again the positive role that OPEC plays as a producer organization in contributing to stable oil markets, for the benefit of all.

Today, thanks to massive monetary and fiscal stimulus packages, the global economic recovery is proceeding at a satisfactory pace, in particular in developing countries. Oil demand is growing again, albeit at an expected modest rate of 900,000 barrels a day for 2010. And prices are at a reasonable level that is satisfactory to both producers and consumers.

However, the risks remain high. They relate to the high levels of public debt in some OECD countries; the unsustainable rates of unemployment in many places; credit tightness and the still fragile financial system; the shaky recovery in private demand that is not yet sufficient to fully support economic expansion; and the associated government support exit strategies.

We therefore need to remain vigilant and avoid complacency.

The other cause that I mentioned earlier is the inefficient functioning of oil markets.

Indeed, oil markets have over the past few years been characterized by excessive volatility and large price swings. Many recognize that the emergence of oil as a financial asset traded through a diversity of instruments in futures exchanges and over-the-counter markets may have helped fuel excessive speculation to drive price movements and stir up volatility. It led to a situation where futures prices were, to a certain extent, detached from the supply and demand fundamentals of the underlying commodity.

This was discussed in detail at the recently held International Energy Forum meeting in Mexico, and we welcome the Cancun Ministerial Declaration, which is a clear indication that nobody wants a repeat of 2008 — neither producers or consumers.

As I said earlier, fortunately the oil market situation has steadily improved over the past year. The more reasonable price levels we see today support investment to provide the much-needed future production capacity. Shelved projects are now being restarted, there is a noticeable rise in activity and in general, there is a more optimistic mood than a year ago. It means we can now return to focusing our attention on the important longer term energy challenges.

Economic growth, expanding populations and higher standards of living mean that energy demand is set to rise in the future, despite significant improvements in energy efficiency. We expect energy use to increase by more than 40 per cent by 2030, according to OPEC’s World Oil Outlook reference case. Fossil fuels, and in particular, oil and natural gas, will continue to satisfy most of the world’s energy needs. This means that the Arab world, with considerable petroleum resources, will continue to play a leading role in the energy scene, far into the future.

And we should never forget that the global need for modern energy services is huge. Here I am thinking about the 1.5 billion people who do not have access to modern energy services and the 2.5 billion people who use solid fuels for cooking and heating, with severe health problems resulting from indoor pollution. In this regard, I wish to emphasize the extremely beneficial role played by Arab Country aid institutions and by our sister organisation, OFID, in contributing to the alleviation of poverty and an improvement in energy access in many developing countries.

However, while we know that energy is set to grow over the long-term, the actual pace of this growth remains highly uncertain.

OPEC’s World Oil Outlook shows that as early as 2020, demand for OPEC crude could be as low as 29 million barrels a day or as high as 37 million barrels a day. This translates into an uncertainty gap for upstream investments in OPEC Member Countries of over 250 billion dollars. There is, therefore, the very real possibility of wasting financial resources on unneeded capacity.

These daunting uncertainties stem in part from consuming countries announcing policies that are geared towards reducing oil demand, subsidizing alternatives and putting heavy tax burdens on the use of oil. Inconsistent, unrealistic and wishful-thinking policy announcements can only provide the wrong signals to markets and investors, creating a lack of certainty and predictability that undermines the ability of the oil industry to invest to meet future energy demand.

This has been epitomized in recent climate change negotiations, where fundamental principles that are enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, such as the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, have run the risk of being watered down by some developed countries. These attempts should be resisted. Historical responsibility of developed countries regarding the state of the Earth’s atmosphere cannot be ignored, as the provision of the UNFCCC that the first and overriding priorities of developing countries are socio-economic development and poverty eradication.

Without the confidence that there will be additional demand for oil, there may be no incentives to invest. And if investments are not made in a timely manner, then future consumer needs might not be met.

Returning to Arab countries, it is clearly evident that huge and successful efforts have been undertaken by many countries to diversify their economies. This includes investing in industries that bring more added-value energy-intensive products, developing tourism and creating logistical port hubs. Many have also recognized the importance of human capital and have invested in advanced universities and research centres in cooperation with some of the best global institutions. This also includes investing in other energy sources, such as solar and nuclear.

All these efforts and achievements are to be praised.

Nevertheless, these economies often remain highly sensitive to both price volatility and to the uncertainties surrounding future energy demand. This underscores the importance of continuing to push economic diversification, especially given the needs of a younger population and the ensuing huge need for job creation in many countries.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The recent difficulties in the energy scene and the challenges that I have described are not new for OPEC.

Since it was established in 1960, the Organization has faced many crises and challenges. It has, however, always survived and has successfully overcome many challenges. It has not only learned from these, but it also gained resilience.

When OPEC was born, the Middle East was already an important and growing crude supply region, while North Africa was in the early stages of developing its newly found oil reserves. At that time, the five Founding Members of OPEC held a total of around 200 billion barrels of reserves or two-thirds of world reserves. On average, they supplied 8 million barrels a day of crude to world markets, representing more than one-third of the total world production.

Today, 50 years later, OPEC is even more important.

OPEC reserves have increased by a factor of five to reach one trillion barrels and its daily production has multiplied by nearly four, to reach 29 million barrels a day. Its production capacity exceeded 35 million barrels a day in 2009.

Of course, this growth is partly due to the fact that OPEC went from having five to 12 Members. But, even if we limit the comparison to the five original Founding Members, the growth is still impressive.

The increased importance of OPEC has been accompanied by a growing recognition of its positive role and by greater trust and confidence in its actions.

OPEC has broadened its dialogue with producers and consumers alike. We are an active partner in the International Energy Forum. We have a high-level of cooperation with many international institutions.

We firmly believe in genuine dialogue and cooperation between energy producers and consumers. This is key to ensuring a stable and predictable energy scene for the benefit of all.

Thank you","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/249-9-may-2010.html"
"2010-03-31","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the Mexican Government for hosting this important meeting, the International Energy Forum (IEF) in helping our host organize the event and co-hosts Kuwait and Germany for their support.

I think it is perhaps appropriate to recall the last IEF Ministerial Meeting, held in Rome in 2008, on the theme: ‘Energy Dialogue to Respond to Global Challenges’. It was certainly a theme with good foresight, given that the last two years have witnessed a period of unprecedented volatility and much uncertainty in energy markets.

In fact, in the period since, there has been much positive global energy dialogue, with the Jeddah and London ad-hoc energy meetings, and, of course, there has been much discussion and debate among all stakeholders leading up to this meeting. OPEC has welcomed such dialogue and has been an active participant.

[Slide 2] The importance of dialogue and cooperation has never been more apparent, as the impacts of the global financial and economic crisis and excessive oil market speculation have been felt throughout the whole industry.

Prices have swung dramatically; demand dropped off in both 2008 and 2009; a number of investments have been put on hold, although some of these are now being revisited; and of course, jobs have been lost.

More importantly, confidence has been shaken and the future blurred with uncertainties.

The important initiative of OPEC Member Country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to hold the ad hoc energy meeting in Jeddah helped catalyze the synergies of producing and consuming countries to work together in order to better understand the factors underlying market instability; and then, take the appropriate actions to ensure that volatility and uncertainty do not return to the same extent. This can be viewed in the recommendations agreed at this meeting; for an enhanced IEF framework that further supports the producer-consumer dialogue; proposals to explore ways and means to help mitigate energy market volatility; and for specific areas of cooperation between the IEF, the IEA and OPEC.

[Slide 3] It is my hope that the large price swings and the extreme volatility that we have witnessed in 2008 and 2009 are consigned to the past. These types of events are detrimental to both producers and consumers. While markets have been more stable in recent times, it is essential we do not forget the price extremes that were witnessed only a short time ago. The price swings in oil markets saw days when the price of crude oil fluctuated by as much as $16/b. This cannot be justified by fundamentals. It was obvious and clear that it was speculative activity, as the regulatory proposals and measures underway in financial markets today suggest.

In an industry of long-lead times and high capital costs, such excessive speculation and price volatility makes for unsuitable investment conditions. It undermines the ability of the industry and its investors to adjust to market changes.

Addressing this concern has been to the fore of OPEC’s thinking. This has not only been reflected in its discussions with the IEF and the IEA, but in other fora, such as OPEC’s joint workshops with the EU on financial markets last year that called for an urgent response to the challenges posed by today’s financial markets.

I appreciate we cannot eliminate volatility altogether. It will always be part of the market. But we need to lessen the magnitude of the swings and I feel that there is now a common understanding that a price that is neither too high nor too low is favourable to all. More stability generates more certainty, for the benefit of consumers and producers alike.

It is also essential to underscore the importance of transparency. OPEC has played a significant part in the development of JODI, which in a short space of time has evolved into an internationally-respected initiative that enhances the transparency, scope, quality and timeliness of data and information flow. And we remain committed to furthering this project.

[Slide 4] These types of initiatives are essential, as we all know the oil industry will play a major role in the world’s energy future. In OPEC’s reference case projections, energy use increases by 42 per cent from 2007-to-2030. And oil will continue to play the leading role to 2030.

It is also evident that there are enough resources to meet future demand. Improved technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery have enabled the world to increase its resource base to levels well above past expectations. And this will continue in the future. Resources are clearly plentiful.

Moreover, non-crude oil supply is, in fact, going to play a major role in satisfying future increases in demand. The key issue is not related to availability, but to deliverability and sustainability, as well as the uncertainties surrounding the extent to which increases in demand for crude will actually materialize.

[Slide 5] At this juncture, let me stress that OPEC remains committed to supporting market order and stability; as it has been in the first 50 years of its existence. This is enshrined in its Statute, its three Heads of State Solemn Declarations and in its Long-Term Strategy.

Today, current spare capacity in Member Countries already exceeds 6 mb/d. This represents a huge level of investment. And clearly demonstrates the seriousness the Organization attaches to the need for adequate production capacity to be in place, not only to meet the demand for its oil, but also to offer sufficient spare capacity. This largely answers the security of supply concerns of consuming countries.

But energy security is reciprocal. It is a two-way street. Security of demand is as important to producers as security of supply is to consumers. The two need to go hand-in-hand.

From the demand perspective, consuming countries must be clearer about the impact of their policies on future oil consumption levels and overall energy demand. There is a need for consistency with credible and reliable signals: one cannot ask for more crude oil investments, while at the same time advocating the need to reduce its use, increasing subsidies for alternatives, and calling for less oil imports from specific regions.

We all want to make sure there is enough oil made available to meet future demand, but it is important to appreciate that unclear or unrealistic policies and decisions can send the wrong signals to producers and investors. And this is true for both the upstream and downstream.

[Slide 6] These issues, alongside the current fears surrounding the pace of the global economic recovery, translate into an uncertainty gap for upstream investments in OPEC Member Countries. By 2020, the gap reaches $250 billion in real terms. And even to 2013, which represents a timeframe over which investments are effectively locked in, requirements could be as low as $70 billion or as high as $170 billion.

There is a very real possibility of wasting financial resources on unneeded capacity.

[Slide 7] Then there is the environment. Our Member Countries are continuing to work hard to increase the efficiency and environmental credentials of petroleum. In this respect, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has enormous potential and offers a real win-win solution. OPEC is proud to be at the heart of the new way forward, but we cannot, nor should we be expected to act alone. CCS needs to be commercialized quickly – developed countries should take the lead in this respect and in the greenhouse gas mitigation effort generally, given their historical responsibility and technological and financial capabilities.

And no one should forget the very first UN Millennium Development Goal: poverty eradication. Every six seconds a child dies because of hunger and related causes, and over 1 billion people do not have enough to eat – more than the populations of the US and the EU combined. A catalyst in helping alleviate poverty is access to modern energy services. In the developing world, 1.5 billion people have no access to electricity and 2.5 billion do not have adequate energy services. Thus, it is critical that the world community makes sure everyone has access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sound energy services. This issue needs the urgent and critical attention of world leaders, much as the attention given to climate change.

[Slide 8] With all this in mind, it is important that the IEF remains a platform for sharing insights and exchanging views about energy market trends, and also helps improve the understanding of the linkages between the physical and futures markets.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

We need to remember that energy is crucial for sustainable economic and social development in each and every country of the world – the world would not function without it. Thus, the world requires an energy market landscape that is stable and predictable. A setting in which investments and expansion flourish; economies witness stable growth; producers get a fair return from the exploitation of their exhaustible natural resources; and where better access to modern energy services helps make energy poverty a thing of the past.

[Slide 9] Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/250-31-march-2010.html"
"2010-02-01","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Ladies and gentlemen: Good morning.

I have the pleasure once more to speak at Chatham House – this time about the Middle East and North Africa, a region to which many OPEC Member Countries belong.

This year, your conference coincides with the celebration of OPEC’s 50th Anniversary.

In 1960, when OPEC was born, the Middle East was already an important and growing crude supply region, while North Africa was in the early stages of developing its newly found oil reserves.

At that time, the five founding members of OPEC held a total of around 200 billion barrels of reserves or two-third of world reserves. On average, they supplied 7.9 million barrels per day of crude to world markets, representing more than one-third of total world production.

Today, fifty years later, OPEC is even more important.

OPEC reserves have multiplied by a factor of five to reach one trillion barrels and its daily production has multiplied by nearly four, to reach 29 million barrels per day. However, its production capacity reached more than 35.2 million barrels per day in 2009.

Of course, this growth is partly due to the fact that OPEC went from having five to 12 members. But even if we limit the comparison to the five original founding members, the growth is still impressive. Their reserves are almost four times larger and their production levels are almost three times greater today than in 1960.

In the downstream, the change is even more dramatic.

The increased importance of OPEC has been accompanied by growing recognition of its positive role, and by more trust and confidence in its actions. This is the result of several factors.

First, OPEC has consistently ensured supplies to the market in a timely manner. Second, a genuine and forward-looking dialogue has helped improve the mutual understanding of producers and consumers.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I would now like to turn to the theme of this session.

There is no doubt that the world today has enough oil reserves to satisfy consumers for decades to come.

But recently, when prices went up, there were some who claimed that oil would soon lose its lead in the energy mix and that oil resources would soon vanish. It is not surprising to hear such claims. It has happened throughout the 150 years of oil’s history.

But this is resource pessimism. And it is, partly, fuelling speculation.

It is true that crude oil resources are finite. But they are plentiful. Estimates from the US Geological Survey of ultimately recoverable reserves have practically doubled since the early 1980s – to 3.4 trillion barrels. Cumulative production to date represents only one-third of this figure.

Improved technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery have enabled the world to continually increase its resource base to levels well above past expectations. And this will continue in the future.

Recently, Brazil made giant discoveries in the pre-salt section of its off-shore basins. And last year, an oil company was able to drill a well to more than 10,000 metres of depth. Significant discoveries have also been made in new areas.

Currently, more than three-quarters of the world’s proven recoverable crude oil reserves – or one trillion barrels – lie in OPEC Member Countries. This figure will certainly increase in the future, given the under-explored status of most of our Countries and the potential for increases in the ultimate recovery factors.

In managing the development of these resources, OPEC Countries are working towards providing a regular and efficient supply of oil to consumers, while also ensuring a fair return to investors and exercising their permanent sovereignty over these resources. This will benefit present and future generations.

Of course, in addition to conventional oil, there is also a vast resource base of non-conventional oil – such as tar sands, oil shale, gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids and biofuels.

It should be clear that the challenge is not – and never was – related to the availability of reserves. The challenge has to do with their deliverability and sustainability.

To turn these reserves into a supply of products, investments are needed, both upstream and downstream.

The oil industry in general – and OPEC in particular – faces three main uncertainties in this regard. They relate to future crude demand, long-term oil prices and inflating costs.

The challenge represented by the future demand for crude has been even greater as the world has faced its deepest, longest and most widespread economic crisis since the Great Depression. The causes of this recession are very well known to all of us, and need not be mentioned again, but the consequences have choked demand for oil.

World oil demand fell dramatically in 2008 and 2009 – by two million barrels per day. It is the first time since the early 1980s that oil demand has declined in two successive years.

Thanks in part to the massive fiscal and monetary intervention by many governments, there are signs that a recovery is under way. But its strength and pace are still highly uncertain. Unemployment in OECD countries is still of great concern. Credit is tight and private sector spending has not recovered enough to fully support economic expansion, without government stimulus.

With all this in mind, we’ve considered various scenarios. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook published in July of last year, we explored the future uncertainties related to demand and economic growth. Our data show that as early as 2020, demand for OPEC crude could be as low as 29 million barrels per day or as high as 37 million barrels per day.

This translates into an uncertainty gap for upstream investments in OPEC Member Countries of over 250 billion US Dollars. There is, therefore, the very real possibility of wasting financial resources on unneeded capacity.

In the long-term, world oil demand is a bit more encouraging. OPEC’s reference case is expected to grow from 85 million barrels per day in 2008 to nearly 106 million barrels per day by 2030.

But without the confidence that there will be additional demand for oil, there may be no incentives to invest. And if investments are not made in a timely manner, then future consumer needs might not be met.

Despite these challenges, large investments to expand upstream capacity are currently underway in OPEC Member Countries. In 2009, around 30 projects came on stream in OPEC Countries, resulting in 1.5 million barrels per day of net crude and liquids capacity. For the next five years, the completion of another 140 projects is expected to add around 12 million barrels per day of gross crude and liquids capacity.

Therefore, we believe that current investments should be enough to both satisfy demand for OPEC crude and provide a comfortable cushion of spare capacity – of more than 6 million barrels per day by 2013.

OPEC Countries have also invested in expanding downstream capacity, both inside and outside Member Countries. Cumulative investment in downstream capacity in Member Countries until 2015 is estimated around 40 billion US Dollars. This will expand refining capacity by more than two million barrels per day – to more than 10 million barrels per day. In addition, another 25 billion US Dollars are being invested abroad, adding further capacity to the global refining system.

All this points to one of OPEC’s ongoing commitments: investing in production capacity. Such investments help OPEC support market stability.

Permit me to briefly outline what I view as the most urgent challenges facing the oil industry now, namely extreme oil price volatility, inflated costs, and lack of qualified personnel.

The extreme price volatility witnessed in the last three years has generated harmful uncertainties with regard to the long-term price of oil. This has, in turn, negatively impacted the ability of companies, and producing and consuming countries, to plan their investments and budgets.

Since 2007, OPEC has been warning that the large swings in oil prices were mainly driven by non-fundamental factors. But these warnings went unheeded.

Thankfully, things have evolved. There is now dialogue within the framework of the International Energy Forum to mitigate this volatility, a dialogue we welcome. In addition, we consider recent proposals from the CFTC in the US to limit excessive speculation in the futures and over-the-counter markets are steps in the right direction.

Inflated costs faced by the oil industry in upstream and downstream activities are another obstacle to investments. In addition, policies in consuming countries add a further layer of uncertainty.

Finally, we are faced with the lack of qualified human resources. Global enrolment in geology and petroleum engineering courses has been dropping for years and many qualified workers are retiring from our industry. This has become one of our most urgent needs.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Clearly, this is a crucial time.

The world has been evolving towards greater interdependence and more integrated energy markets. And the world will continue to need more and more energy.

It is true that an increasingly diversified range of sources will contribute to satisfy these needs. But oil will remain the fuel of choice.

Considering the fact that everyone has faced daunting challenges with the global economy recently, I cannot emphasize enough the need to work together. The responses of governments to the recent economic crisis have demonstrated the importance of coordinated efforts.

OPEC’s Third Summit of Heads of State meeting in Riyadh in 2007 called for developing existing and new avenues of cooperation with all stakeholders. In this spirit, we are endeavouring to enhance formal and active dialogues with many producing and consuming countries. OPEC is also active within the International Energy Forum, a platform for promoting producer-consumer dialogue.

It is these joint efforts, about which I am optimistic, that will lead us all to a more secure, stable and sustainable world.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/251-01-february-2010.html"
"2009-11-12","Ladies and gentlemen:

Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here with you today.

I want to extend special thanks to the Deputy Premier and Minister of Energy and Industry, His Excellency Abdullah Hamad Al-Attiyah, for hosting this important event.

My theme this morning is the global economy — with specific reference to the oil and gas industries. Allow me to first share some thoughts on recent global events. I will then make some comments on the outlook for our industry.

Crisis & Recession

Triggered by a financial crisis that began in 2008, we have experienced the deepest and most synchronized economic downturn since the Great Depression. The consensus suggests that the roots of this turmoil can be found in the unregulated mortgage and credit markets of the world’s industrialised economies. From there, it has fast spread to countries around the world.

This has resulted in an economic landscape that for the past year has been characterized by decreased industrial production, declining capital flows and a steep fall in trade. In addition, per capita GDP has fallen, wealth has eroded and unemployment levels have risen. (These are now close to 10% in the US and the Euro-zone.) Problems also persist in the financial sectors of many countries.

As a result, recent estimates for world economic growth in 2009 have been revised downwards — from initial forecasts of 3.9% to minus 1.2%.

It is important to note that the fiscal and monetary stimulus offered by advanced countries and major emerging economies have had a positive effect. These measures have been instrumental in stabilizing the global economy. However, it is still too early to talk about a consolidated recovery. Many sectors are still facing serious challenges.

In fact, the financial crisis and the economic downturn have had a profound impact on energy markets — and the oil and gas industries in particular. There has been unprecedented volatility and a significant contraction in world demand, as well as deferrals in energy projects and investments.

Extreme Price Volatility

It’s important to recall that much of this global turmoil took place while we were seeing extreme price volatility in the crude oil markets. Oil, like other commodities, was being used as a financial asset. And, in combination with the depreciation of the US dollar, substantial levels of investment capital were flowing from the financial to the commodity markets.

This increased speculative activity in global commodity markets led to extreme fluctuations in prices. As OPEC said at the time, the magnitude of this price volatility was not at all consistent with market fundamentals. There were days last year when the crude oil price fluctuated by $16/b. In July of last year, crude prices reached a peak of $147/b. Then, driven by the global economic downturn, they plummeted to low $30’s in December.

Such price volatility makes for unsuitable conditions for investments. In an industry like ours, marked by long lead times and high capital costs, price volatility undermines the ability of oil and gas industries (and their investors) to adjust to market changes.

Stability, on the other hand, generates certainty and makes sustained investments in capacityexpansion projects feasible. Oil price stability then is not just our desire. It is an industry need.

Volatility — and the risk of instability it represents — is a constant challenge for OPEC. But the Organization has always been ready to take the necessary steps to restore balance in the market. For example, in December, despite significant oversupply in the market and sufficient stock levels, prices fell to extreme lows. In response, OPEC decided on a downward adjustment to its production in order to avoid a further fall in prices.

Such actions are in line with OPEC’s ongoing commitment to market stability. But continued stability — and future supply levels — depend on the promotion and improvement of greater consistency and transparency in the market.

That is why we are encouraged to see steps now being taken in the US and elsewhere to introduce regulatory reforms to the financial markets and commodity trading practices. Such measures are supportive of what OPEC has said all along about the role of speculative pressures on prices — and the damaging consequences of extreme price volatility.

Demand Contraction

While there has been some recovery in crude oil prices in the past year, the oil industry continues to be affected by the global economic downturn and constrained demand levels. Falling consumer income levels and contractions in manufacturing have led to a significant erosion of aggregate demand.

Even electricity — a sector that has traditionally been quite resilient — has seen a drop in consumption.

There are some indications that US consumption is gradually recovering from steep historical declines. And earlier forecasts of world oil demand growth in 2009 have even been revised upward by 0.2 mb/d, to stand at minus 1.4 mb/d.

Considering the existence of ample supplies, low refinery margins and stock overhang, OPEC chose to maintain production levels at its recent meetings. This again demonstrates the Organization’s commitment to keeping the market well-supplied, responding to economic conditions and adjusting to ever-changing circumstances.

Prospects for a Recovery

As we move forward, the global economy continues to face many risks and challenges. But there are some positive, promising signs. According to recent analysis, the second quarter of 2009 marks the bottom of the global recession. This has been supported by comments from G-20 leaders, as well as IMF and World Bank officials.

OPEC’s forecast for 2009 world GDP growth stands at minus 1.2%. However, for 2010, the forecast for 2010 now shows positive world GDP growth of 2.7%, raised from an initial forecast of 2.3% in July.

Only 0.5% of this growth will come from OECD economies. Instead, it’s the emerging economies of China and India that will lead the way, with expected 2010 growth rates of 8.5% and 6.5%, respectively.

In line with global growth expectations, there are signs that overall global demand contraction will ease in the fourth quarter. The consensus is that oil demand growth will return after two full years of contraction. This suggests that demand growth will be 0.7 mb/d in 2010, and will gradually rise to 1.2 mb/d by 2013.

Most of this demand growth will again be in non-OECD countries, with transportation, industrial and petrochemical industries leading the way.

In terms of investments in the oil and gas industries, we should recognize that last year’s market volatility and low price environment had an adverse impact on projects. The instability discouraged investments projects in both OPEC and non-OPEC countries, and many other projects were delayed or cancelled. But with current prices today — and signs of a rebound in global economy next year — we are seeing the re-activation of several OPEC projects.

All these indications are in line with OPEC’s expectations. While we remain cautiously optimistic, there are signs that we are moving into positive territory for 2010. But we recognize that there are still many challenges ahead.

Energy Security

One of these challenges is ensuring market stability, and the security of supply and demand which it requires. This is what we call ‘energy security’. The future of our industries depends on energy security. And investments in projects depend on more clarity about expected consumption and demand levels. Without such clarity, there is only uncertainty — a known enemy of investments.

In the meantime, OPEC continues to maintain spare capacity of about 6 mb/d. Although this is costly, it allows OPEC to be ready to respond to sudden or unexpected supply disruptions. And while non- OPEC supply is growing, OPEC countries continue to invest in capacity in order to ensure that there will be ample supply — to meet consumer needs in the future.

There are other important challenges:

We are learning to adjust to new financial regulations that many countries have implemented in order to respond to the crisis and re-activate their economies.

Similarly, there is also pending environmental legislation in the world’s advanced, oil-consuming countries, which require that we all adjust to the realities of a carbon-constrained world.

Considering these new developments, OPEC acknowledges that new technology must be used to improve the environmental credentials of the fossil fuel industry. Some OPEC Member Countries are currently at the forefront of research and development into carbon capture and storage (CCS), a pioneering technology that has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from conventional fossil fuels.

At the same time, the Organization recognizes that industrialised countries have a historic responsibility to lead the way in its development. But OPEC also sees a need for more predictability in these emerging energy policies.

In closing, let me say that it is important to remember that market stability is something that requires joint efforts. Those of us in the oil and gas industries are all stakeholders. We have a great common interest in achieving market stability for the sake of our investments, in the interests of foreign trade and in order to ensure a sustainable energy future.

But that future has to do with two fundamental things:

• improving the performance of the energy sector through collaboration, and
• enhancing the global economy for the whole of mankind.

Nothing short of these aims will do.

"2009-04-02","​Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

​I would like to thank the organizers of this important event for the opportunity to address such a distinguished audience. It gives me great pleasure to be here today.

​The global financial and economic crisis continues to unfold – but not only in the rich, industrialized countries from where it originates. It is also severely affecting developing nations, a category into which many oil producing countries fall.

​We are faced with ever more dismal economic indicators, despite continued news of stimulus packages and bailouts from industrialized countries. We look with high expectations to the leaders of the G20 who need to provide clear, coordinated and immediate actions in order to restore confidence. These actions should include the introduction of strict financial regulations, the absence of which is at the heart of today’s problems.

​Turning our attention to the oil industry in particular, we can see that the crisis has impacted demand significantly. In 2008, global oil demand growth was in decline for the first time since the early 1980s, while oil demand for 2009 is now forecast to fall by around 1 mb/d. These downward revisions show the continued deterioration of the world economy and contracting international trade.

​At OPEC we are currently working on our World Oil Outlook for 2009, which will be released in the summer. Inevitably our forecast for 2009 will be different from that for 2008, illustrating just how much today’s environment has affected oil supply and demand.

​OPEC Member Countries are already shouldering a good deal of the responsibility for turning the global economy around. As most of you know, at our March meeting, we maintained oil output at existing levels, despite the current low price environment and the market’s persisting crude oil stock overhang. OPEC’s objective, as ever, is to bring about long lasting market stability.

​When we consider what the future holds for the oil industry – the very title of this session – it is important to remember that the short-, medium- and long-terms are all interlinked. Concerning ourselves only with the immediate situation will lead to a potential impasse in just a few years. We must not lose sight of our medium- and long-term perspectives.

​Extreme oil prices, whether too high or low, are damaging to producers and consumers alike. The extreme highs of last summer driven by poorly regulated future markets – even though the oil market remained very well supplied – were just as problematic for the long-term stability of the market as the low prices of today. Such volatility is devastating to an industry with long lead times and massive upfront costs.

​We can all appreciate that the fall in oil prices since last summer has offered some short-term relief to consumers. According to some institutions, today’s oil price is providing a stimulus of some $1 trillion to the struggling global economy. However, we believe the figure is much, much larger. If we consider the last half of 2008 and 2009 together, the figure may reach $2 trillion and OPEC’s share accounts for some $800 billion of this. And at least some of this stimulus is already being felt by the whole world.

​We all want to see the global economy back on its feet as quickly as possible, but we also need to appreciate that short-term relief does not always translate into long, or even medium-term, gain. At the recent 4th International OPEC Seminar, there was a convergence of views on this very point. The current oil price breaks the very momentum of investment in the oil industry – a momentum that is as vital for continued research and development and encouraging new human capital, as it is for capacity expansion to meet future demand.

​Although OPEC Member Countries are continuing to invest, so far they have collectively postponed a number of projects earmarked for startup over the next decade. And many important conventional, non-conventional and marginal oil projects outside our Member Countries have already been delayed or abandoned altogether.

​All this means that there is a potentially massive supply crunch waiting to happen. But calls for oil producers to continually invest amid deteriorating economics simply fly in the face of basic economic sense – as I am sure many of the business leaders in attendance today will attest. Reasonable and stable oil prices are necessary to encourage a broad range of investments across the energy spectrum.

​We accept healthy debate within the industry concerning global energy supply, since we recognize the need to develop other forms of energy to meet the world’s growing need for fuel in the coming decades. But we also ask for clearly-stated, non-discriminatory and realistic energy policies, so that we may make informed investment decisions. The future needs to be about enhancing the planet for the whole of humankind – not about policies aimed at pushing specific political agendas.

​Unclear policies increase volatility and add to uncertainty. This is evident in scenarios developed by the OPEC Secretariat. Last year, our World Oil Outlook showed that by 2020, the amount of crude oil required from OPEC could easily range between 29 mb/d and 38 mb/d. In monetary terms, the difference between the lower and higher upstream investment requirements from Member Countries collectively could be more than $300 billion in real terms. The current economic climate is adding more uncertainty still.

​Despite this uncertainty, there remains a broad consensus that fossil fuels will continue to provide most of the world’s energy needs for the foreseeable future. And it is precisely because of oil’s continued importance that we must look to technology for a way forward.

​Many of our Member Countries are already working hard to increase the efficiency and environmental credentials of fossil fuels. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has enormous potential in this respect and offers a real win-win solution. OPEC is proud to be at the heart of the new way forward, but we cannot, nor should we, act alone. CCS needs to be commercialized quickly – developed countries should take the lead in this respect and in the greenhouse gas mitigation effort generally, given their historical responsibility and technological and financial capabilities.

​I would like to conclude by reiterating three main points:

​First, make no mistake fossil fuels will be at the heart of meeting global energy needs for the foreseeable future.

​Second, there are converging views that a stable, realistic and ‘fair’ price for oil is vital to prevent recurring volatility that will derail the global economy’s recovery and also encourage producers to invest in new capacity, new technologies and above all attract and retain much-needed manpower.

​Third, protecting the environment should be about enhancing the future for generations to come, not promoting specific political agendas. So we need clear, transparent and non-discriminatory policy agendas.

​Thank you for your kind attention.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/255-2-april-2009.html"

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In looking at the theme of this session – “Mapping the Future Energy Scene” – I feel it is important to begin with what has today become the world’s overriding concern: the global financial and economic crisis.

It is clear that its implications have moved far beyond the countries where the crisis originated. And of course for the oil market, there are ever more worries about the impact the crisis may have on the medium- to long-term outlook.

We need to appreciate that mapping the energy future means linking the short-, medium- and long-terms; they cannot be treated in isolation. And in this regard, we need to learn from the past and ask ourselves, how have previous crises impacted the industry?

Thinking back to the 1990s, there were downturns in a number of OECD countries at the start of the period, and towards the end of the decade many of us were impacted by the fallout from the Asian financial crisis.

It led to weak oil prices, and an actual price collapse in 1998 and early 1999. It meant that through much of the decade the industry was deprived of the required amounts of capital to invest adequately for the future.

In turn, the downsizing and cost-cutting strategies that occurred left the industry short of essential skills and with an ageing workforce, as well as significantly reduced budgets for research and development into new technologies.

We can all appreciate that these developments have impacted the industry in the years since.

And it is obvious that what occurred in the 1990s is similar to what is happening today.

The question is: do we follow a similar path in dealing with the current crisis, with delays and cancellation in investment, layoffs, and little or no research and development? Or do we look to follow an alternative route, with solutions that look beyond the near-term?

I hope that everyone here today agrees that we should be looking at the latter. It is essential that we all recognize the importance of developing a sustainable energy future.

To do so, we need to look at all the core issues, such as the reasons behind the current crisis; oil prices; supply and demand; projects on the table; the investments; the costs; human resources; technology; the environmental challenges; and, policy targets.

Allow me to provide you with some additional comments – in no particular order – on a number of these issues.

Firstly, it is clear that confidence has to be restored and the world economy put back on track.

It means, looking at where the crisis originated, namely the banking sector, and taking the necessary measures to quickly restore confidence. Thereafter, the needed regulations must be put in place to make sure it never happens again. The focus should be on reining in financial speculation, everywhere, and in a coordinated manner.

Secondly, there is the oil price and investments.

For a few months last year, oil prices were certainly extreme. I should add, however, that these were not an indication of a shortage of oil. The market was well-supplied with crude and stock levels were high.

It was caused mainly by speculative investments flowing in and out of the futures markets. There was a total disconnect between these markets and the actual physical one.

Today’s low prices are moving to the other extreme. The dramatic fall that has taken place since the crisis took a hold globally is now seriously threatening the long-term stability of the oil market.

At present, oil prices are not at the levels needed to support the industry’s expansion. And the situation is particularly acute given the fact that construction costs relative to oil prices are still very much on the high side. This has been acknowledged by a broad consensus of stakeholders.

Thus, current prices threaten the very sustainability of planned industry-wide investments. We have all heard of project cutbacks, delays and cancelations. It is putting future crude supply at risk.

And this is not just an oil industry issue. It impacts the broad energy spectrum. Each energy source, each technology, and each project, has a price when it is viable; and a price when it is not.

It is essential to find and sustain a stable and realistic price. We need only recall the past, to see how low oil prices can damage the industry’s future.

Thirdly, we have the human resource.

The past has shown us that it is critical to maintain and advance the adequacy of the industry’s skills base, even during an economic downturn.

This is because the world economy will return to growth. We all know this. And with energy being the “backbone” of the global economy, it points to increasing energy demand.

Then, there is technology.

Advancements in technology have helped expand production, improved recovery rates and at the same time facilitated a continuing increase in the estimates of global ultimately recoverable reserves. In fact, USGS estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves have practically doubled since the early 1980s and continue to rise.

It is essential that the research, development and deployment of technology continues, so that the industry can continue to develop, produce, transport, refine and deliver oil to end-users in an ever more efficient, timely, sustainable and economic manner.

This includes the early development and deployment of cleaner technologies. For example, Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS), is a proven technology that can be cost effective, and has the potential to contribute significantly to reducing emissions.

It may not be easy in the current climate, but we need to recognize that crises come and go. Yes, we all want to see the global economy back on its feet as quickly as possible, but we need to make sure that it is sustainable.

For the energy industry, this means not losing sight of the long-term, as in all scenarios mapped by the OPEC Secretariat, and other energy research institutions, future energy use is set to significantly rise. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook (WOO) 2008 reference case, it increases 50 per cent by 2030.

And realistically, fossil fuels will continue to satisfy most of the world’s energy needs, contributing more than 80 per cent to the global energy mix over this period. Of all fuel types, oil will continue to play the leading role, although its share will be slightly lower in 2030.

In short; it means major investments will be required, significant numbers of personnel will need to be recruited and trained, and considerable advancements in technology will be necessary.

However, with such big, costly and lengthy undertakings in mind, the market needs to find a balance. And in this regard, perhaps the key issue at present is the importance of sustaining a stable and realistic price that supports all the elements of security of supply and security of demand.

This sits at the heart of all the issues I have touched up on today. It is essential this is addressed.

The overall goal is to provide a stable setting in which investments and expansion flourish, economies witness stable growth, and where better access to modern energy services help make energy poverty a thing of the past.

It is a challenge for us all. We share a common interest in energy market stability when mapping the energy future.

All this points to being inclusive. And I would like to say to you all here today to look at solutions and ways forward over all the various timeframes – ones that learn from the past; and ones that benefit us all. This will be essential for the industry’s healthy evolution in the years ahead.

And with that I wish you an enjoyable and successful OPEC Seminar.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/256-18-march-2009.html"
"2009-03-09","Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me first begin by extending my sincere appreciation to the Emir of Qatar, His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, for sponsoring this conference. It builds on the success of prior gatherings held in this dynamic city of Doha.

In addition, I would also like to thank Qatar’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy and Industry, His Excellency Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah, as well as Qatar Petroleum for inviting me to deliver a keynote speech at this important event.

Qatar is, of course, the right place to talk about natural gas. With vast endowments, the country is a prominent global player. It is a major producer of natural gas and a top LNG exporter.

In addition, now is the right time to be talking about natural gas. With the ongoing financial turmoil and the most significant economic downturn since the Second World War, the impact of the global crisis on energy markets needs serious discussion. There are broad global challenges ahead for both oil and gas.

IMPORTANCE OF NATURAL GAS

Excellencies, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, natural gas is becoming increasingly vital to the overall global energy mix.

With its steady growth and a share of world energy supply that is forecast to reach nearly 25% by 2030, natural gas has very bright prospects.

In terms of both reserves and production, OPEC Member Countries have significant shares of natural gas:

In all of this, Qatar has a remarkable position:

Qatar’s advances are the result of the country’s faithful commitment to both capitalizing on technological innovation, and fostering cooperation between NOCs and IOCs.

I have no doubt that after the current crisis passes, Qatar and our other Member Countries will be well-positioned to continue pursuing their role as catalysts of growth in the evolving global gas markets.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

But right now we face a very tough environment.

The global economy has been hit hard by the financial crisis. Economies everywhere are facing recessions and the scale of the contraction has exceeded all expectations.

As everyone knows by now, this crisis has its roots in the advanced economies. But in this interconnected world, it has spread to all countries, including the poorest ones — those who are least responsible for the crisis.

With shrinking industrial activity and a continuing spiral of wealth erosion, the one question that remains is how long this storm will last.

Several leading economies are making substantial fiscal efforts to bail out industries and revive banking systems. But it remains to be seen whether this will be sufficient.

The priority should be restoring confidence — in banking and financial institutions, in businesses and markets, and among consumers. This is the key to making markets work again and to reviving the global economy.

LAST YEAR’S PRICE VOLATILITY

In addition to the current economic downturn, it would be useful to recall last year’s volatility in crude oil prices. Since natural gas complements oil, considering the challenges faced by crude will help us consider the prospects of the gas industry.

Last year, crude prices escalated from the low $80s in January to highs above $145/b in July. They then dropped to lows of $30/b by the end of the year.

A similar pattern was observed in the prices of other commodities, including natural gas and coal.

As OPEC has long argued, this kind of wild volatility is not caused by market fundamentals since the market was well supplied. It is the result of the increasing use of oil and other commodities as an asset class. The speculative funds flowing into — and out of — the commodity futures markets exposed the physical oil market to financial market volatility.

The sharp deterioration of the world economy during the second half of 2008, coupled with tumbling equity markets and speculative fund redemptions, then led to a sharp slide in prices. In the last quarter of 2008 alone, they fell by more than $60/b.

Where are we now? Since the beginning of 2009, crude prices have been fluctuating around $40/b.

And as news spreads about stagnant business activity in Europe and depressed economic indicators in Asia and the Americas, we expect to see continuing downward pressure on prices.

IMPACT ON DEMAND

All this is having a considerable impact on worldwide oil demand.

In 2008, global oil demand declined for the first time since the early 1980s. This year, it is expected to shrink by 1.0 mb/d as a slump in oil demand growth in the OECD spreads to other regions of the world.

This points to a troubling scenario in which demand for OPEC crude is expected to drop by 1.9 mb/d from a year earlier, to 29.0 mb/d.

The market, facing a deepening world-wide economic crisis, is also under pressure from prevailing supply and demand uncertainties. This highlights the importance of OPEC’s actions, including its most recent output decision taken at Oran, Algeria.

So OPEC stands firm — ready to pursue its commitment to contribute to market stability.

PRICE EXTREMES ARE DETRIMENTAL

But hampering OPEC’s efforts are the great uncertainties generated by the continuing lack of price stability.

The current low price environment certainly represents a significant loss in revenues for both IOCs and NOCs. But it is also leading to underinvestment in Exploration and Production projects — in both crude and natural gas.

In a low price environment, projects with high marginal costs and long lead times are hit very hard. The reasonable returns needed to make vital investments in capital-intensive projects in this and other industries remain elusive.

And with the current constraints on access to credit and debt markets, and the uncertainty generated by the global crisis, deep budget cuts in our industry simply become unavoidable.

All of which translates into a decline in drilling activities and staff lay-offs around the world. But it has also led to project delays or cancellations in both the upstream and downstream.

In short, underinvestment now may result in market imbalances in the future. And no matter how hard OPEC Member Countries try to contribute to market stability, it cannot be attained without price stability.

Extreme prices destroy demand patterns, make investment decisions difficult and undermine sustainable economic growth. And this applies to gas markets as well.

IMPLICATIONS FOR GAS MARKETS

I’ve been speaking about the challenges facing world oil markets. But what I’ve described mirrors the situation now faced by the world’s natural gas markets.

Like oil, natural gas is experiencing demand contractions in major consuming regions of Asia, North America and Europe stemming from the global economic downturn. In addition, the current low price environment has impacted investment decisions on capital-intensive gas projects, and has strained the development of new, more expensive gas supplies.

Despite these challenges, many OPEC’s Member Countries — like Qatar — with their vast natural gas endowments and rising market share will continue to play an important role in the development of a dynamic global natural gas market.

IMPORTANCE OF DIALOGUE & COOPERATION

But no one is isolated from today’s global challenges. And in times of great adversity and unprecedented challenges, promoting dialogue and cooperation is important.

Such open communication can help us face turbulent events — like the global economic crisis — together.

In this, Qatar has been among the top leaders — not only in promoting technological advances but also in enhancing open dialogue and cooperation between IOCs and NOCs.

Thus, forums such as this one — and the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) — are increasingly important. They bring together producers, consumers, investors and technology providers to share information, make collective actions more effective and achieve greater transparency and predictability in the gas sector.

In more concrete terms:

These are all significant challenges. And in an environment like the one we face today, it may be easier said than done. But it is important that we make the effort.

The challenges are, indeed, great. But the resulting opportunities can benefit us all.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/257-9-march-2009.html"
"2009-02-10","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Over the past few months, the world seems to have shifted beneath our feet.

A financial crisis — the worst since the Great Depression — has led to a deep recession in OECD countries and to a dramatic economic slowdown in developing countries.

This crisis has its roots in the advanced economies.

But in this globalized and interconnected world, it has spread like wildfire to all countries, including the poorest ones — those who are least responsible for this crisis.

OPEC Member Countries are no exception. They face big losses in their equity markets, lower economic output and dramatic declines in oil export earnings.

Under these exceptional circumstances, OPEC, as an organization, is still trying to maintain its commitment to ensuring a stable oil market.

But we are increasingly concerned with the impact the crisis may have on the medium- to long-term outlook.

In addition, the steep decline in oil prices is a direct threat to the long-term stability of the market.

Not only have low prices been damaging to our Member Countries, they have also created a challenging environment — in terms of dampened investments for capacity expansion projects.

And this should concern us all — not just those of us in the oil industry or from oil-producing countries.

SPARE CAPACITY

It’s essential to first highlight the importance of spare capacity — in the context of OPEC’s existing capacity and its historic commitment to meeting the world’s medium-term oil demand.

As part of its commitment to ensure market stability, OPEC has always played a unique role — with its policy of consistently maintaining adequate spare capacity.

OPEC’s capacity, in terms of its resources and immediate availability of production, has always been sufficient to accommodate the world’s oil needs. With nearly 80% of the world’s crude oil reserves, OPEC’s Member Countries represent 40% of world oil supply.

Their spare capacity has been put to effective use many times to mitigate the destabilizing effects of exceptional events on global oil supply.

In recent years, during surges in demand or unexpected transportation disruptions due to geopolitical tensions or natural disasters, OPEC supplied more than 4.5 mb/d of additional crude to satisfy market needs.

But this could not have been done without continuous and planned investments in capacity-expansion projects.

By investing in spare capacity, OPEC shields the world from the damaging effects of supply interruptions — and, more generally, from the negative impacts of extreme market volatility.

Unfortunately, some people think that any existing spare capacity must be used.

Last year, for example, in reaction to record prices, OPEC Member Countries were urged to use their spare capacity to increase production.

But this suggestion missed the forest for the trees.

EXPECTED DEMAND

In 2008, with the downturn in the world economy, global oil demand started to contract for the first time since 1983.

Given this expected drop in demand levels in the short- to medium-term — and the expected growth of non-OPEC crude supplies at the same time, which is expected to be around 0.6 mb/d — overall spare capacity is set to rise over the next few years.

Nevertheless, in the medium- and long-term, we do expect demand to rebound again — especially when the global economy recovers.

With all this in mind, we are currently holding more than 8 mb/d spare capacity, keeping it ready for any additional demand or unexpected disruptions.

It’s important to note that the maintenance of this spare capacity alone implies a significant cost.

Furthermore, plans to expand spare capacity — to offset decline rates as well as to prepare for expected long-term demand increases — also require funding.

But uncertain future demand has put this planned spare capacity — as well as the long-term availability of crude — at risk.

DOWNSIDE RISKS TO FUTURE DEMAND

Many future demand scenarios of course have been brought into question by the global credit crunch — and, more importantly, by the virtual “price destruction” that we have seen in recent months.

However, there are other important downside risks to future oil demand levels which are significant.

For example, there are proposed fiscal and environmental policies in several countries that aim at favouring the development of alternative sources of energy — over oil.

These strategies are risky — since such policy prescriptions will discourage companies from investing in crude oil now.

Additionally, there is the long-term risk that if alternative energy sources fail to meet set quantitative targets, crude capacity by then might be insufficient to make up any resulting supply shortfall.

Now, it is important to emphasize that we, at OPEC, welcome diversity in the global energy mix.

But policymakers need to recognise that by pushing too hard for alternative energies as oil substitutes — rather than as complements — they are adding to uncertainty about future demand.

This demand uncertainty not only impacts the expected future demand for OPEC crude, it also discourages the required level of investments that need to be made now. Such uncertainty is one of the biggest challenges for making investment decisions in the oil industry.

In addition, the current low price environment poses the risk of underinvestment — which could lead to significant upward price potential.

So when oil demand does eventually start to pick-up, this could all lead to the familiar boom-bust cycles that we all remember from years past.

UNPRECEDENTED PRICE VOLATILITY

Turning to prices, I think there is no one who would consider last year’s prices to have been reasonable. And hardly anyone can suggest that it was the fundamentals of supply and demand that pushed the oil price above $147/b last July.

With ample crude supply in the market and high stock levels, OPEC found no reason for this volatility other than the speculative investments flowing in and out of the futures markets.

And for more than a year, we recommended greater regulatory oversight of commodity futures trading.

But only time will tell if policymakers decide to do something. We feel it is vital to learn lessons from what has happened.

THE IMPACT OF LOW PRICES

Today, of course, the price situation is quite different.

The worsening real economy and massive redemptions in the speculative funds industry have brought the price of oil to extremely low levels.

Recently, they have been hovering around $40/b.

This current low price environment raises several problems:

- First, current prices will not sustain the industry.

They are at about half the level required to attract investments to the industry and ensure sufficient production capacity to meet future demand.

Current prices are also well below the level needed to cover the marginal costs of many projects — effectively stalling the exploration and development of any new frontiers.

Several oil sand expansion projects in Canada, for example, have now been delayed or cancelled.

And with construction costs relative to oil prices still up, not even conventional projects are investment-worthy.

The ongoing global crisis with its dwindling credit lines has already forced some companies — both IOCs and NOCs — to cancel or delay projects, and even announce layoffs.

At OPEC, we have already seen delays in more than 35 of 150 planned upstream projects. Some of these have been postponed until after 2013. The start-up dates of many other projects are also expected to slip.

Thus, current prices threaten the very sustainability of planned investments — in both conventional and non-conventional crude — and put future crude production at risk.

- Second, current prices are also detrimental to many of our Member Countries.

They use oil revenues to finance important health, education and welfare programmes for their populations.

This low price environment is, of course, not what any of us desires. Nor is it a situation from which the world’s businesses, consumers or economies will benefit.

I sincerely believe that all of us need to recognize the fact that if the current price environment does not change, then we will all face a far more challenging energy scenario in the future.

CONCLUSION

In times of trouble, many people look the other way, avoiding difficult decisions.

We don’t have the luxury of doing this in the oil industry. We need to make investment decisions now to ensure adequate supplies in the future.

It’s not only the fate of oil-producing countries that is at stake, but that of oil-consuming nations and hundreds of industries around the world.

But sound investment decisions can only be made when signals are clear.

And for this, we need:

OPEC has always tried to faithfully pursue its mission of ensuring stable, secure and reasonably priced crude. But the times in which we now live require new approaches.

Perhaps we should say that the current crisis offers us a chance to work together, with other stakeholders, to find ways to navigate the storm, to make renewed efforts to share data, make informed investment decisions and find common ways to ensure security of supply and demand.

The prosperity and well-being of people everywhere depend on this combined seriousness of purpose — so that when the global economy eventually recovers, we will all be ready to support the world’s engines of economic growth.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/258-10-february-2009.html"
"2009-01-29","Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organizers for inviting me to share my thoughts with you on this important subject.

The world faces an unprecedented financial and economic crisis, not witnessed for many years.

The credit crisis, still unfolding, is now deeply affecting real economies across the world. Credit markets are under continuous stress and equity markets are in freefall. Oil prices are today around $40, which is 70% lower than their peak of last July.

Why are we in such a dire situation? It is the result of greed, poor management and inadequate regulation. This is all well-documented.

Facing the danger of a collapse of the international financial system, governments and central banks have responded boldly and swiftly, by using a series of mechanisms, including interest rates cuts, liquidity provisions, capital injections, tax cuts and economic stimulus packages.

It is still too early to say whether such actions will be sufficient to restore confidence and jump-start the economy. It is likely, however, that 2009 will remain a difficult year and it is not known if a recovery will come later this year or in 2010.

No economic sector is shielded. And the knock-on impact has far-reaching implications for the oil sector.

OPEC has frequently said that high oil prices were not an indication of a shortage of oil, but were the result of speculative money inflows, with the volume of paper barrels traded in regulated exchanges or over-the-counter rising dramatically. There has been a total disconnect between physical and futures markets; and price and fundamentals.

OPEC has repeatedly stressed that extreme volatility is in the interest of no one and that extreme price levels, both high and low, are damaging for producers and consumers alike.

More recently, as the financial crisis deepened and the state of the real economy worsened, the price of crude oil tumbled. The growth in oil demand turned into negative territory and projections for 2009 have been continuously revised downwards.

This has had a huge impact on the oil industry in general and oil exporting countries in particular. Between July 2008 and today, OPEC’s export income has reduced by approximately $365 billion.

Moreover, OPEC has had to adjust downward its output, leaving idle a large level of capacity, sometimes only recently put on stream. Since the end of 2003, around 8 mb/d of new capacity has been added. [Note: around 4.5 mb/d net]

We are already witnessing the reaction of the oil industry to this low oil price environment, with reductions in investments, project delays, and even layoffs.

OPEC, with its actions aiming at balancing the physical market and, thus, at avoiding extreme volatility, is helping escape a repetition of the past, where low oil prices led to low investments and thus to a shortage of capacity when the economy recovered.

But, more importantly, confidence has to be restored and the world economy put back on track. The needed regulations to rein in financial speculation have to be put in place, everywhere, and in a coordinated manner.

At OPEC, we are committed to ensuring stable, secure, reasonably priced supplies of crude oil to the market at all times, in support of sound economic growth. And this is done by continually monitoring all the various inputs, analyzing the information available, and then making informed decisions.

We have much to deliberate when looking at oil demand today and in the future. Take the key drivers of economic growth and consuming countries energy policies. Both create huge uncertainties over how much oil is needed in the future and how much capacity should be developed.

OPEC welcomes diversity in the overall energy mix, as well as the push to develop renewables and nuclear, but we need to give careful thought to how we proceed. Oil market stability requires predictable policies and a reasonable balance of interest.

Let me put forward a couple of questions in this regard. Should fiscal and policy incentives that push other sources of energy, also discriminate against oil, despite the widespread calls to majorly ramp up oil production? And should oil producers invest in projects that might best be described as a ‘consumer back-up policy’ in case proposed targets for other energy sources are not met?

I feel the answer to both questions is ‘No’.

To put the overall risks in some context, allow me to provide you with some figures. OPEC scenarios show that demand for OPEC crude by 2020 could be as low as 29 mb/d or as high as 38 mb/d. This is a huge range.

There is much to take on board. And whilst all this can be a headache at times, they are issues that must be dealt with. Investment decisions have to be made. And these can only be made on the evidence and market signals before us.

I would like to finish by looking at the final question posed by this session: what opportunities does the crisis bring for the energy sector? In all challenges, there are opportunities, and in this instance one of the biggest is the chance to further enhance cooperation.

We need to look at such issues as the projects on the table, the investments, the costs, the policy targets, market regulation and demand. The goal is to have better understanding of each other. This can only be beneficial in an increasingly interdependent world.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/259-29-january-2009.html"
"2008-12-19","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the Right Honourable Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, for the opportunity to contribute, once more, to the debate on the impact which financial markets have had, and are continuing to have, on global energy markets.

Today, the financial crisis, triggered by the sub-prime mortgage difficulties in the US, is taking its toll. The world economy is dramatically slowing and, in some regions, even entering into deep recession.

This situation has real and far-reaching implications for the future outlook of the oil industry. It has a compounded, adverse impact on commodity-exporting countries, in particular those whose economies are highly dependent on petroleum export revenues.

These recent developments amplify the concerns expressed in Jeddah regarding the impact of unguided financial markets on the price of oil and its volatility. Now, there is a sense of urgency to the Jeddah Statement’s call for improved transparency and regulation of financial markets.

We welcome the focus of this Meeting on what is clearly a very important matter.

The extremely high volatility of the oil price during recent months has been well documented. In the summer, prices were driven to record highs by unlimited speculation, as the dollar weakened and investors sought cover in commodity markets. More recently, as the financial crisis deepens and the state of the real economy worsens, the price of crude oil has tumbled.

However, lower crude prices do not translate into equally lower prices at the pump. The price that the end-consumer pays comprises significant amounts of taxation. This is especially the case in Europe and Japan.

We have been through similar oil price cycles in the past. We all know that extreme oil prices, whether too high or too low, are as bad for producers as they are for oil-consuming countries.

Today, we are already hearing about cut-backs to spending on new projects, in response to deteriorating economics. The new-found difficulties in raising credit are also contributing to slowing investment across the whole industry.

OPEC has always responded – in an adequate and timely manner – to increases in oil demand and to weather-related supply disruptions. Such responses have been made possible thanks to the spare capacity, developed and maintained by its Member Countries.

The Organization increased its supply by close to 5.0 mb/d, for example, between 2002 and last year. Member Countries have also implemented huge investment programmes to increase production capacities.

The oil industry is now faced with a severe reduction in oil demand, due to the financial crisis that has its roots in the industrialized world. This is happening at a time when large new capacities are being put on stream in OPEC Member Countries. They were built, or planned, at a time when costs were very high and they are now in danger of being left unused or delayed.

OPEC took timely action and provided much-needed contribution when the world faced surges in oil demand growth. What is the contribution of large consuming countries in today’s environment of sharply declining demand?

I welcome again the opportunity offered today for a comprehensive and fruitful exchange of views.

I thank you all.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/260-19-december-2008.html"
"2008-12-02","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to thank the Institute for International Energy Studies for inviting me to deliver this keynote address in the capital city of one of OPEC’s five Founder Member Countries, the Islamic Republic of Iran.

This conference is being held at a critical time for the oil industry, with the plunging oil prices and high level of volatility, the turmoil on financial markets, and the steady slide into recession of many economies.

How did this situation arise?

Its roots can be found in the US subprime mortgage crisis, which began in summer last year, at a time of very little financial regulation, when loans were made beyond the true ability of many borrowers to service them in a credit-driven society.

To remedy the situation, the Federal Reserve Board tried to provide liquidity to the banking sector, through a series of interest rate cuts and other measures. However, these cuts, together with the worsening economic outlook, weakened the dollar and saw a flight from it into commodity markets, including oil, as investors around the world sought better financial returns.

Through hedging against the falling value of the dollar and inflation in this way, these international speculators were treating crude oil futures contracts as financial assets. Their actions greatly increased the amount of activity on futures markets and this had a big influence on crude oil prices.

These rose by an astonishing amount, from US $92 a barrel at the start of this year to a peak of $141/b in early July, for OPEC’s Reference Basket.

Significantly, this happened while the market was well-supplied with crude. In other words, prices were going firmly against market fundamentals.

During that period, we said many times in OPEC that the poorly regulated international financial sector was the main driving force behind the heavy volatility. And the global financial turmoil of the past two months has supported our statements.

The price collapse since July has seen the reverse side of the coin.

Without the support of sound market fundamentals, oil prices fell sharply, when the bubble burst and the world economic outlook weakened.

Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the sharp fall in oil prices within such a very short period, and the volatility that goes with it have serious implications for the future of the industry. With oil prices below half what they were at the beginning of the year, both producers and consumers should have cause to be concerned about the investment climate for the industry.

The short-term outlook for the oil market remains gloomy. The global economy is slowing down faster than expected, and it is looking more and more likely that world oil demand will actually fall next year. We need to take action or actions in this critical period in support of market order and stability for the short, medium and long terms.

OPEC Member Countries, being developing states, are heavily dependent on revenues from oil sales to meet their developmental obligations to their people, from social services to the provision of economic infrastructure for sustainable development. It follows naturally, therefore, that crude oil prices should be high enough to ensure that these countries receive reasonable and sustainable levels of revenue from the sale of their natural resources to assist them get on the path of sustainable development. In addition to meeting these obligations, these countries also need this revenue to invest in the industry.

OPEC has made it clear that it is prepared to act, whenever it considers it necessary in these critical, rapidly changing times. We shall continue to ensure that the market remains well-supplied with crude at all times, with sufficient capacity to cope with seasonal fluctuations and unexpected events, as well as meet the steadily rising demand over the longer term, provided that price is reasonable, widely acceptable and sustainable.

The reference case scenario from OPEC’s latest World Oil Outlook sees world oil demand rising by around a third in the coming decades, climbing from 85 million barrels a day in 2006 to 113 million barrels a day in 2030.

This is a big increase and it will create a major challenge for OPEC’s Member Countries, since they have more than three-quarters of the world’s proven crude oil reserves. Our Organization also possesses around half the world’s proven natural gas reserves.

Our host country, the Islamic Republic of Iran, is, of course, one of the world’s largest producers of both oil and gas, and is deeply involved in the challenges facing all of us.

Excellencies, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, allow me to observe that the organisers of this conference could not have chosen a better theme: Energy management. The high levels of price volatility and the worsening outlook for the world economy have made this a very difficult year for energy-managers. This is especially the case in developing countries, with their heavy reliance on oil revenue.

Few things are worse for a manager than uncertainty, and the volatility experienced this year has added greatly to the uncertainty that already exists in the market.

Indeed, in trying to reduce such uncertainty, we repeatedly call for greater transparency and predictability from consuming countries with their energy policies, as well as for better recognition of the legitimate concerns of other stakeholders in the industry.

Already, delays, cutbacks and cancellations of projects are being announced throughout the industry as a result of the fall in crude oil prices, and the fear that it is not going to be reversed soon. Moreover, this trend has been reinforced by the present severe restrictions on credit and the gloomy world economic outlook.

Our Member Countries are all affected by this, and there are tough decisions to make, at a time when we are all tightening budgets.

No one can really be sure how the situation is going to work out, either in the oil market or, more generally, in the world economy at large.

However, there are some measures that oil producers can adopt, and I believe these will ease the task of handling the present very volatile situation.

First is to remain focused. It is important at this critical time to retain a clear vision of the future direction of one’s oil industry. If one loses sight of this, then actions taken in the market may become disjointed and less effective, especially over the longer term.

Retaining a clear vision will also help prioritise areas where decisions and actions are needed, and sometimes this may occur at short notice and with reduced budgets, resources and personnel.

Second is to continuously monitor developments very carefully. This is very important at a time when events can change significantly overnight, as has happened sometimes this year. This monitoring should extend beyond the energy sector, to pick up signals at an early stage from the world economy at large. Developments in the world economy, as we have seen, can very quickly affect oil market behaviour.

Third is to be prepared to respond to signals at short notice in a considered and constructive manner.

My fourth advise is Do not Panic. Carefully study the situation, learn from past experience and take a rational decision. Rational decision-making, I believe, can benefit from having a good knowledge and understanding of the recent history of the oil industry. There are certain parallels, for example, between current events in the oil industry and those of the early 1980s.

There is a call for patience too. This year alone, prices rose quickly and they fell quickly. Who knows where they will be in three months’ time? If there is a ‘50-50’ situation and it is not necessary to make a decision, then there may be no harm in delaying the decision.

And finally, consult and dialogue. The present crisis provides an excellent opportunity to enhance dialogue and cooperation within the industry. Mutual help and support has an important role to play in unusual times like these, especially within the OPEC family. All parties stand to gain from this.

Conferences like this one, of course, are part of the process of dialogue.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/261-02-december-2008.html"
"2008-11-19","Vienna, Austria, 19 November 2008

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber for the opportunity to address such a distinguished gathering on behalf of OPEC’s Secretary General, His Excellency Abdalla Salem El-Badri. It
is indeed a pleasure to be here.

Energy use has been central to world economic development and social progress over many decades and centuries, providing light, heat and mobility. It remains crucial for alleviating poverty and expanding economic opportunities. More specifically, mobility, the subject of today’s roundtable discussion, has been fundamental to much of humanity’s progress over the centuries. And there is no doubt that it will remain so in the future.

Under all scenarios, energy use is set to rise. In OPEC’s World Oil Outlook reference case, it increases 50% by 2030. Renewable energy will grow fast, but from a low base. Realistically, fossil fuels will continue to satisfy most of the world’s energy needs, contributing more than 80% to the global energy mix over this period. And of all fuel types, oil will continue to play the leading role, although its share will be slightly lower in 2030.

Developing countries will account for most of these increases, by virtue of higher population and economic growth. However, energy use in developing countries will remain much lower on a per capita basis; for example, by 2030, a North American citizen will still consume on average five times more oil than a citizen of China. Moreover, a large part of the world population will continue to lack access to modern energy services.

At the sectoral level, transportation is the key for future oil demand growth, given the unique characteristics of this energy source. This potential is all the more so in developing countries, where levels of vehicle ownership are still very low. Indeed, four billion people live in countries with less than one car per twenty people. In OECD countries, such as here in Austria, this ratio is typically around one car for every two people, close to saturation.

It all clearly highlights why there is a need to focus on the transportation sector. It is critical to individuals, businesses and countries.

Now given this background, what are the challenges ahead?

In the transportation sector, a broad range of technologies will certainly be explored. However, it is essential to be realistic regarding what can be achieved in an affordable and sustainable manner. For example, it is evident that there is still room for significant efficiency improvements in areas such as powertrains and materials. This is something that is obviously welcome and which my colleagues in this roundtable will certainly cover.

I would like to now specifically focus on the oil supply perspective. Let me reassure you that the world has enough remaining oil reserves and resources to meet demand and satisfy consumers for decades to come. In addition to conventional oil resources, there is the huge potential for developing non-conventional oil, such as tar sands and shale oil.

Therefore, the issue is not one of availability; it is one of deliverability and sustainability.

On deliverability, standing in the way of turning resources into supply and implementing sound investment strategies is the large amount of uncertainty that exists about future oil requirements. This is a major challenge for oil producers in general and OPEC Member Countries in particular. On the one hand, there is the willingness to invest in sufficient capacity to ensure that future consumer’s needs are met, including the provision of an appropriate level of spare capacity. On the other hand, however, like in any sound business, there is no economic logic in committing vast amounts of capital to develop production capacities that may not be needed. It all underscores the importance of predictable energy policies, and reliable signals from the market and consuming countries.

Let me provide you with one example. This relates to what are increasingly being viewed as overly ambitious targets for biofuels. These have not only sent confused signals concerning oil industry investment needs, but have also led to their appeal being questioned due to unforeseen impacts in such areas as food prices and the diversion of land-use.

The other issue is sustainability, with its main two components: air quality and climate change.

I think we should recognize that the automobile and truck industries, as well as the refining industry, have a good track record in reducing the pollutant emissions of vehicles. For example, EU specifications for maximum sulphur content of petrol and diesel was reduced to 50 parts per million three years ago, and is set to fall to just 10 parts per million next year. And across the world I am optimistic that much can be progressively achieved in the near future.

Today, climate change is a central concern for us all, but there is no ‘silver bullet’ to solve this challenge. No doubt, addressing it will require a plethora of measures.

In this regard, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, such as power stations, the single largest source of emissions, could represent a significant low-cost path to climate change mitigation. Carbon dioxide capture & storage is a technology that has a high economic mitigation potential, and according to the IPCC, it could contribute to as much as 55% of the global CO2 mitigation effort needed to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere.

Of course, developed countries should take the lead in this mitigation effort, given their historical responsibility, as well as their technical and financial capabilities. This is in line with the United Nations Rio Summit and UNFCCC principles of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as the principle of equity.

Let me finally address a more immediate concern facing us today – the ongoing global financial crisis and its impact on the real economy.

It is still difficult to know how deep, how long, and how widespread this crisis may turn out to be. Clearly the short-term risks are skewed towards the downside. From an oil market viewpoint, all organizations including OPEC have reduced drastically their projections for oil demand in 2008 and 2009. And oil prices have declined by around US$90 in just four months, with associated increased volatility. Low prices send weak signals to investors in upstream and downstream oil projects, and, to a great extent, sow the seeds for possible sharp increases in prices and volatility. This was witnessed in the not so distant past, in both the 1980s and 1990s.

It is also important to recall events only a few months ago. We saw record high crude oil prices, which drew attention to the role of financial markets, as well as the then declining value of the dollar, in driving the crude oil price and volatility, in particular through increased speculative activity. Many believe that the proper functioning of futures markets has been altered by the various loopholes that effectively allow unlimited and undetected speculation, far beyond the limits of healthy liquidity-providing levels towards damaging price-distorting ones. The financial turmoil of the past two months has certainly provided more broad-based evidence of the possible adverse impacts of loosely regulated financial markets.

What I should like to add is that during these periods of price swings and volatility, the market has remained well-supplied. OPEC has, and continues to demonstrate its commitment to market stability at all times.

If I were to try to sum up, in one word, the future of energy, in line with what I have shared with you today, it would be: “interdependence”. And this is why we at OPEC believe that dialogue and cooperation is the way forward.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/262-19-november-2008.html"
"2008-10-28","Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I would like to begin my brief intervention with some factual statements:

The first is that more than any other previous conference organized by Oil and Money, this year’s conference is taking place in an environment of unprecedented global financial uncertainty.

Second is the fact that the speed at which we got to where we are today has taken most of us by surprise.

A third fact is that this is a phase in the global economy, which will come to pass.

Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, what is not a fact are the answers to the questions: how deep is this crisis going to be and how long will this phase last?

As I am sure we will all agree, the answer to these questions, particularly the latter question is very very important for the oil industry for many reasons.

In the first place, the oil market, like most businesses, cannot function well in an environment of huge uncertainty. This is especially so given the long lead times for investments in the industry.

Timeliness, as we all know, is critical in any sound investment strategy. No rational investor would want to invest too early or too late, as either way could result in losses. For this reason, it is important that the uncertainties surrounding the global economy clears so that plans could proceed to provide the world with the energy it needs for the future.

As OPEC has made clear on several occasions, our Member Countries are committed to capacity expansion to meet growing future energy demand.

We remain committed to adding net capacity of around five million barrels per day by the end of 2012, through investment of over US $160 billion, and additional US$ 60 billion plus in the downstream sector over the same period.

This brings me to the theme of this year’s conference: The New Realities of High-Cost Oil, a subject that has gained wide currency in recent years, given the dramatic rise and fall in oil prices especially since mid 2004.

As has been noted by many authorities of the industry, the rise in oil prices have been accompanied by a corresponding rise in the costs of all facets of the industry: exploration, production, transportation, refining and distribution. In some cases costs of service have grown more than four times since 2003. At the same time, skilled manpower has become a lot scarce.

All this takes me to the issue of the right price for oil.

Our position at OPEC is that the right price is that which avoids the extremes of high and low. It must not be too high as to make it unaffordable or have a negative impact on global economic growth. Nor must it be too low as to threaten the social and economic development of oil producing countries, whose economies rely heavily on oil revenues, and thus make any investment in future supplies impossible. Under both scenarios, OPEC assumes that fundamentals are the key drivers of the market. We are all living witnesses to the effect of underinvestment in recent decades on the industry. We should not allow that to happen again.

Allow me to conclude with some more statements of fact again.

The OPEC reference basket price rose to US$ 140.73 in early July and dipped to US$ 60.27 in October.

The average price for the ORB for 2002 to 2008 is US$ 54 per barrel. In OPEC, we will continue to work to ensure that the market remains well-supplied, and with sufficient spare capacity to cope with seasonal fluctuations and unexpected events.

The decision of the OPEC Conference last week to cut production by 1.5 million barrels per day with effect from November 1, 2008, should therefore be seen in the light of our commitment to stabilizing the world oil market.

I thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/263-28-october-2008.html"
"2008-10-22","Thank You Mr. Chairman

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

I would like to start by thanking the organizers for inviting me here to address you today. It gives me great pleasure to be part of such a high-level gathering.

Whilst we are here today to look at a time horizon of 2030, I feel it is important to share with you some thoughts about what is currently front page news all over the world: the global financial crisis.

The turmoil that has hit major financial markets and shaken many investment institutions over the past month has sent shock waves through the world economy. No-one is immune from the current situation, including of course the oil sector.

There are a number of questions we need to ask. For example, how might future economic growth and energy demand be affected? How might the shortage of liquidity affect everything from routine day-to-day operations to the devising and implementation of long-term investment strategies? How might the future international financial environment differ from the past? And how might it impact the emerging market and developing countries and the achievement of the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals?

The close links between the financial sector and the oil sector are already evident when looking at the volatility and level of oil prices over the past year or so. Prices have witnessed significant movements, firstly upwards and then downwards. Since the mid-summer highs, crude prices have fallen by more than 50 per cent. And there has been a rise of US$16 in just one day of trading, and a fall of $15 a barrel over three days. Volatility continues to characterize the market.

Yet I would like to stress that throughout this turbulent period, supply and demand fundamentals have been sound, thanks to the pro-active measures taken by our Member Countries. The market has remained well-supplied with crude, and stocks have been at comfortable levels. Supply has been, and continues to be, more than sufficient to meet demand. It leads me to a question: what do we make of these developments?

While prices were rising, we were stating that this was due to the influence of non-fundamental factors, notably the heightened levels of speculation, the falling value of the US dollar, geopolitical developments, downstream bottlenecks and misguided perception of market tightness promoted by investment bank reports.

Now that there have been significant changes to some of these factors, such as the recent strengthening of the dollar, the easing of geopolitical tensions and the expectations of a global economic slowdown, with its impact on oil demand, we have been witnessing big falls in the oil price. Speculators, for example, have liquidated their long positions on NYMEX, and this, in itself, has helped drive prices down. (For example, open interest in WTI futures has dropped from 1.5 to 1 million contracts since mid-summer).

This all supports what we have been saying over the past year about the enormous pressure that speculation and non-fundamental factors have been having on oil price volatility. Let me stress here: there is too much at stake across the world for such high levels of speculation and volatility to have such a major and damaging impact in the market. This has certainly been borne out in the recent financial sector developments.

It all points to the need to reduce the market role of excessive speculations, and the necessity for some form of regulation. This is something OPEC has called for. Industrialized countries have made some headway in this regard, which can be viewed in a number of recent measures. Whilst OPEC welcomes these, the progress of this needs to be monitored carefully.

We should also remember that low prices will, without any doubt, result in the cancellation of many upstream and downstream projects, and this will lead to future long-term supply problems.

Now, I would like to turn to the longer term and touch on three key areas: technology, the human resource and what links everything, market stability. The importance of these is evident from looking at the past, it is clear from looking at how things stand today, and each one will be essential to the industry’s future.

Allow me to start with technology. Given that today’s theme looks out over 20 years, I think it is relevant to take a few moments to look back at the past two decades, and see how technology has changed the global oil industry landscape?

What is evident is that when you look back 20 years, there were some tasks that seemed impossible. Yet, as I am sure you can all appreciate, many of these tasks are today taken for granted. Technology has transformed our industry and empowered it to be more effective and efficient. There has been the information technology revolution, moves to explore and develop deeper offshore, better sub-surface imaging and directional drilling.

This has helped expand production, improved recovery rates and at the same time facilitated a continuing increase in the estimates of global ultimately recoverable reserves. In fact, USGS estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves have practically doubled since the early 1980s and continue to rise. It is interesting to note that cumulative production during this period has been less than one-third of the increase. On top of this, there is also a vast resource base of non-conventional oil to explore and develop.

The issue is not whether the resources are there. We know they are. The world has enough oil resources to meet demand and satisfy consumers for decades to come. Availability is not a concern. The question is one of deliverability.

So given this, and the expectation that fossil fuels will continue to satisfy the overwhelming share of the world’s commercial energy needs for the foreseeable future, the challenge going forward is clear. It is making sure that the emphasis is placed on how to develop, produce, transport, refine and deliver oil to end-users in an efficient, timely, sustainable, economic, reliable and environmentally-sound manner.

Technology can help us to promote the early development and deployment of cleaner technologies. In this regard, Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) is a proven technology that can be cost effective, and it has the potential to contribute significantly to emissions reductions.

Another issue is the human factor. This is critical in developing, adopting and deploying technology. Yet today, there are questions being raised over the future adequacy of the human resource skills base. There are a number of reasons.

Our industry continues to expand leading to the need for more skilled labour, but at the same time we face more competition for talent from the expanding service and knowledge economies. And it should not be forgotten that a significant percentage of the current workforce is expected to retire in the next ten years.

There is a need to broaden the ways and means to find, hire, train and keep talented people and transfer knowledge to the next generation. They will be the ones that drive our industry in the decades ahead.

This brings me to market stability. The importance of this is readily apparent today. And it will be the platform on which we continue to develop and expand our industry. It is something OPEC has been committed to since the Organization was founded in 1960.

What I should like to underline here is both the supply and demand perspectives, and the fact energy security is a full circle. Security of demand is as important to producers, as security of supply is to consumers.

Some people say that oil producers are not investing enough to be able to cater for future demand from consuming countries. While I cannot speak for other producing countries, the opposite is indeed the case for OPEC countries. For example, in the upstream sector, investments of more than $160 billion are expected to increase crude production capacity by around 5 mb/d by 2012 from current levels. With this, spare capacity is set to grow. And downstream, investment levels over the same period exceed $60 billion.

Looking to the future, it is clear there is much at stake. Scenarios developed by the OPEC Secretariat that by 2020, the additional amount of oil required from OPEC ranges between 32 mb/d and almost 41 mb/d. In monetary terms, the range for Member Countries upstream investments is as high as $320 billion. This represents a huge uncertainty for Member Countries upstream investment requirements.

In addition, risks over possible future demand patterns are skewed towards the downside, due to a range of drivers. For example, the current financial situation, recent energy and environmental policy initiatives and higher tax rates that tend to push towards a reduction in demand.

It is clear that this could lead to situations of over-investment, or under-investment. On the one hand, for producers there is a real prospect of wasting precious resources on capacity that may not be needed. And on the other, without the confidence that additional demand for oil will emerge and the market signals that long-run prices are supportive, the incentive to invest can be reduced. This may lead to a situation where consumer’s needs are not met. Neither is it conducive to a healthy and balanced market.

I should like to stress, however, that despite the current financial stress and its inherent uncertainties, and the increasingly tight access to credit for businesses in all industries, OPEC remains committed to ensure the market is adequately supplied at all times.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Here in Moscow later this week, as part of the OPEC-Russia Energy Dialogue, we will hold a joint workshop to discuss oil market developments and outlook, multilateral issues and prospects for cooperation. This is in line with the committed and coordinated approach that OPEC places so much value on.

Clearly, the energy industry is much better off when we have an understanding of each of our viewpoints and objectives. All of us associated with the industry have a role to play in developing and promoting solutions that can overcome the challenges that lie ahead. It will help us find the right balance in handling the core issues before us, and it will be essential for the healthy evolution of the oil industry and the global economy.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/264-22-october-2008.html"
"2008-07-02","Mr Chairman,
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for arranging this official OPEC/IEA luncheon and Aramco for sponsoring it. Let me also congratulate the World Petroleum Council on its 75th anniversary and for the outstanding contribution it has made to the industry during this time. Long may this continue!

Some of us here today attended the Jeddah Energy Meeting ten days ago. It was interesting to note how often the subject came up of the need for OPEC and the IEA to work together closely and take the lead in restoring calm to the oil market, with the IEF forming the third corner of the triangle.

As some of you know, there has long been a strengthening of relations between OPEC and the IEA, on both a formal and informal basis, especially in technical areas. This includes the holding of joint high-level workshops and OPEC’s participation in the IEA’s Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme. Also, we were both heavily involved in setting-up the IEF and the Joint Oil Data Initiative.

I am sure my friend Nobuo Tanaka will agree with me that, as a result of all this, there is much common ground between OPEC and the IEA on oil matters. And this is supportive of the continued healthy development and evolution of the industry in the years ahead.

Mr Chairman,
Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I shall focus on four issues in this address.

The most pressing of these is oil price volatility, which has increased over the past ten months, with effects that are being felt, increasingly, in other parts of the world economy. Of special concern here is the impact on the least-developed countries.

The volatile price behaviour was discussed at length at the Jeddah meeting, which was called specifically for that purpose. There was widespread agreement that a combination of factors has been behind this behaviour.

OPEC’s Member Countries stressed that speculation has been playing a significant role in the volatility and rising prices. This is evident in the fact that more than 70 percent of oil futures contracts on the NYMEX are currently held by speculators. This represents a dramatic rise.

It is becoming increasingly clear that some form of regulation is needed to moderate this. Industrialised countries have made some headway in this regard, which can be viewed in a number of recent measures. OPEC welcomes these. Better regulation should eventually affect the price behaviour of not just oil, but also other commodities, which have suffered in a similar way from excessive speculation.

Let me state clearly that market has no shortage of physical crude, with comfortable stock levels. Today, supply is higher than demand. OPEC output currently stands at 32.2 million barrels a day, well above the forecast average level of demand for its oil for the whole of 2008, of 31.8 million barrels a day.

OPEC has played a big part in stabilizing the oil market, by increasing output when needed and by aiming to ensure that there is always a comfortable cushion of spare capacity. Indeed, OPEC supply has risen by 7.4 million barrels a day since 2002, compared with just 3.2 million barrels a day from non-OPEC.

Let us be clear about this. If more crude is needed, we will supply it. But what is the point of supplying more volume, if it is not needed? Does anyone behave like this in any other economic sector? The problem is not volume. It is price.

My second issue concerns resources. The world has plenty of oil. Ultimately recoverable reserves of conventional oil worldwide have doubled since the early 1980s and continue to rise. Technology has resulted in new discoveries, increased recovery rates and improved efficiency.

In addition, there is vast potential for the expansion of non-conventional sources of oil, such as tar sands, oil shale, heavy oil, gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids and biofuels.

The IEA has also looked closely into this issue and has reached the same conclusions. We know that oil is a finite resource, but there is clearly enough of it to meet global needs for generations to come. The world has plenty of energy resources, but bringing them to the market obviously involves significant challenges. This brings me onto my third issue — investment.

The outlook for the coming years is sound. Despite rising costs, there are more than 120 upstream development projects underway in OPEC countries, with over US $160 billion in cumulative investment to 2012, to add net capacity of around five million barrels a day.

With this, spare capacity is set to grow.

Downstream too, our Member Countries are also investing heavily in refinery capacity and delivery infrastructure. This will help address the refinery bottlenecks in some consuming countries, which have been adding to the general oil price volatility.

Our commitment to bring secure, stable supplies of oil to the market is as strong for the future as it is for today. Our Member Countries are ready, willing and able to meet this commitment for the foreseeable future.

However, as was widely accepted in Jeddah, producers must be assured that demand will actually be there, when they invest heavily in expanding production capacity. A climate of uncertainty is detrimental to sound investment strategies. The upfront costs for investment are enormous in the oil sector, and it should not be forgotten that most of the world’s leading producers are developing countries.

Therefore, every effort must be made by consumers to maximise transparency and predictability, especially in regard to policy-making.

And finally, there is the issue of technology, which applies right across the supply chain and can bring enormous gains in efficiency and output, as well as addressing environmental concerns.

Notable here is the technology for carbon capture and storage, whose potential for combating climate change is receiving greater international recognition, as again was clear in Jeddah. But the technology needs further development and finance, as the process advances to mainstream commercial viability. Industrialised countries are best equipped to take the lead in this.

However, technology alone is not enough! We also need to focus on the human resource. More effort must be made to attract highly skilled personnel to the industry, to support its future development.

We believe that cooperation should be enhanced among international, national and service companies from all producing and consuming countries. The challenges facing the oil sector are many and varied in today’s interdependent world. A committed, coordinated approach from all parties is needed to address them, and the World Petroleum Council will clearly continue to have a major role in supporting this.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/265-02-july-2008.html"
"2008-06-09","Excellencies, distinguished ladies and gentlemen;

Thank you for inviting me to speak at this gathering which is to discuss Energy poverty in Africa.

Allow me first to commend the OPEC Fund for International Development, OFID, for putting this workshop together. It demonstrates OFID’s abiding commitment to economic and social development in the developing countries, especially in Africa, where four of OPEC’s member countries - Algeria, Angola, Libya and our host country for this event, Nigeria - come from.

This two-day gathering will no doubt offer participants the opportunity to critically examine the issue of lack of access to modern energy services on the African continent and how this impacts on its quest for economic and social development.

Access to modern energy services has for long been looked at from essentially one perspective, namely, the ability to switch on the light, power the air conditioning system, the television and such other house-hold appliances that make life worthwhile. However, lack of access to modern energy services entails more than our not being able to enjoy some of these comforts of life that are taken for granted in developed countries. It is indeed, one of the greatest impediments to social and economic progress.

The United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development has described access to energy as crucial for human activity as well as for economic and social development. It is critical to halting the growing rate of poverty, epitomized in high child mortality rates, poor maternal health care, poor educational and other infrastructure, limited opportunities to realize the fullest potentials of some of the brightest minds, recurrent social instability and underdevelopment, in poor countries. In a very serious way, energy poverty stalls progress on worldwide development programmes including the quest to achieve the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Energy poverty is a vicious cycle.

The challenge, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, is : how can we ensure reliable, sustainable and affordable energy when the price of energy and oil in particular keeps rising, further removing it from the reach of the poor?

Currently, oil is selling for more than 130 USD dollars per barrel, bringing in its wake, calls on OPEC to increase supply. As an Organization of developing countries, OPEC is mindful of the adverse effects of high oil prices on poorer nations. It has therefore, always taken measures to increase supply whenever the need arises.

For now, the shared opinion, based on major data and leading indicators show that while oil prices may be going up, there is no shortage of oil in the market, and that inventories of major consumer regions are at comfortable levels. OECD commercial stocks are standing above the five-year average, while OPEC spare capacity has been on the rise, thus continuing to provide adequate cushion to ease market concerns about possible supply shortfalls.

The existing volatile situation in the market is therefore, a clear indication that oil prices have been vulnerable to factors other than market fundamentals. The sharp increase in crude oil prices over the last ten months has coincided with a continuing decline in the value of the US dollar, which has encouraged asset portfolio substitution as investors seek to hedge against inflation and the decline in value of the dollar by switching directly to commodities or indirectly via index trading.

This has caused crude oil prices to become disconnected from the dynamics of supply and demand fundamentals and the heightened levels of speculation have been a principal driving force behind the volatility as oil, like other commodities, has been turned into a financial asset. This increasing role of speculation is of great concern to all of us.

The continued volatility in the oil market is unsettling for normal day-to-day activities, as well as hampering sound investment planning for the future, and worsening the plight of the poor.

Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me reiterate what we have always said: OPEC has no influence over speculation. Our ability to influence the market is limited to working to ensure balance in supply and demand. To this end, our Member Countries have committed themselves to investing more than $160 billion USD towards crude oil capacity expansion programmes that will add additional 5mb/d by the end of 2012.

OPEC’s reference projection to 2030 reflects the widely held view that energy demand will continue to grow for the foreseeable future and that oil will maintain its leading position in the world energy mix. Average annual growth of 1.4 per cent will see world oil demand reach 118 mb/d by 2030, with OPEC expected to supply 41.5% of that amount.

In all these, it is necessary to consider what provisions, if any, are being made for poorer countries that do not produce oil, and lack the financial power to buy from the market.

Since it was founded nearly half a century ago, OPEC has had three landmark summits through which heads of state of our Member Countries gave directives that have positively shaped the Organization’s focus in carrying out its mandate. The first summit held in Algiers in 1975, produced the OPEC Fund for International Development, OFID, which has been working to alleviate poverty in more than 120 poor countries across Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America, through the provision of aids and grants. This gathering, ladies and gentlemen, demonstrates that OFID is still living that objective by organizing this workshop to critically examine the issue of energy and poverty in Africa. In addition to OFID, our Member Countries also render assistance to poorer developing countries through various arrangements including bilateral and multilateral aid institutions.

Today, more than a third of the world’s population live with no access to modern energy services; an estimated 2.5 billion people in developing countries rely on biomass for their cooking and heating needs, while about 1.6 billion live with no access to electricity. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, it is estimated that over 130 million people rely on firewood, cow dung and crop residues for their cooking and heating needs. This has enormous health implications for the people and it gives them no escape route from the poverty cycle.

In addition, the impact of indiscriminate felling of trees on the environment is best imagined. OPEC and its Member Countries are concerned about the environment. This is evidenced in the decisions of the 3rd OPEC Summit of Heads of State and Governments that took place last November in Riyadh, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where USD750 million was pledged by some of our Member Countries towards funding research relating to energy, the environment and climate change.

But how can Africa overcome this lack of access to energy services which is threatening to stall the continent’s development efforts and initiatives? How can they provide greater access to energy services to their people? These are the challenges that this workshop should hope to address.

Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, permit me to say that in your search for solutions to Africa’s energy poverty, you should spread your nets far and wide, looking into the various energy mixes which Africa has in great abundance.

I wish you very fruitful deliberations and thank you for your kind attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/266-09-june-2008.html"
"2008-04-21","Thank you, Mr Chairman, for your introduction.

Let me begin by thanking the Italian Government for hosting this event, and also the co-hosts, India and Mexico.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

OPEC recognises the International Energy Forum as a leading platform for producer-consumer dialogue.

[Slide 2]
Genuine, multilateral, well-targeted and constructive dialogue and cooperation are essential in meeting the challenges facing an increasingly interdependent energy world. These benefit all parties.

Progress made at previous Forums has led to a better understanding of the views and interests of countries, industry and other stakeholders on important energy issues. This is undoubtedly a positive development.

We need to continue along this path, since further progress is required in some important areas, to seek a convergence of views and an enhancement of mutual understanding.

In the short time available, I shall focus on some key issues during my address.

[Slide 3]
First, however, let me briefly summarise some key findings from the oil outlook presented in OPEC’s background paper for the period up to 2030.

In the reference case, world energy demand grows at an annual average rate of 1.7 per cent, to satisfy the needs of a rising, more urbanised world population, as well as to meet continued economic growth.

Fossil fuels will continue to provide more than 85 per cent of the world’s total commercial energy needs; there are no viable substitutes in such quantities on even the most distant horizons.

And oil and gas will be the leading sources, together accounting for more than 60 per cent of the total energy mix.

Average annual growth of 1.4 per cent will see world oil demand reach 118 million barrels a day by 2030.

Most of the new demand will come from developing countries, with consumption doubling to 58 mb/d, and Asia will account for more than half this increase. Nevertheless, energy poverty will remain an important challenge. By 2030, developing countries will consume, on average, about five times less oil per person than OECD countries. In sector terms, transportation will be the main source of the world rise.

[Slide 4]
Now, I should like to look at the first of the key issues: volatility. This continues to have a serious impact on the oil market, together with the persistent upward pressure on prices.

Non-fundamental factors have been mainly responsible for this. Indeed, as is well-known, in today’s market, crude oil prices have become detached from the dynamics of supply and demand.

[Slide 5]
The heightened levels of speculation have been a principal driving force behind the volatility, with oil becoming a financial asset. The falling value of the US dollar has encouraged additional inflows of money into the crude oil futures markets. We welcome recent moves by many industrialised countries and key intergovernmental bodies to address the financial turmoil and help reduce speculation. This comes nearly a year and a half after OPEC and the European Union held a joint workshop on the impact of financial markets on crude oil prices.

Also contributing to the volatility are the ongoing geopolitical developments, perceived market tightness and bottlenecks in the refinery sector. The last factor is compounded by the fact that the expansion of refinery capacity is under pressure to keep pace with rising demand for lighter products and more stringent specifications.

[Slide 6]
OPEC has played a vital role in keeping the market well-supplied during the recent volatile period, with our Member Countries increasing crude output, as needed, and accelerating capacity-expansion plans. There are, for example, more than 120 upstream development projects, and cumulative investment in new capacity exceeds US $150 billion.

These countries have also been increasing their presence downstream, at home and abroad, with more than $60 billion of investment in refining.

[Slide 7]
Another longstanding issue requiring attention is the persistent uncertainty about future demand trends. This is affecting the ability of our Member Countries to devise and implement effective investment strategies in production capacity, from which the market at large will benefit.

Important drivers of uncertainty include future world economic growth, consuming countries’ policies, technological developments and non-OPEC performance.

Uncertainty can be very costly for oil producers. Scenarios we have prepared, based on plausible higher and lower world economic growth assumptions, show that, even by 2020, there is an estimated range of uncertainty for required investment upstream by OPEC producers of around $270 billion.

Without the confidence that additional demand for oil will emerge, and without the market signals that long-run prices are supportive, the incentive to invest can be affected. Just like anyone else, oil producers do not want to invest in capacity that will not be used.

There is a clear need, therefore, to increase security of demand. One important area where consumers can act is in policy-making — through the introduction of greater predictability, consistency, stability and transparency. The Joint Oil Data Initiative has, of course, been a good starting point in this respect.

[Slide 8]
Adding to the uncertainties about investment is the sharp increase in the unit cost of adding capacity, with one research body noting that upstream costs have nearly doubled since 2005. On top of this, the industry is experiencing a shortage of skilled personnel for both construction and operations, with a large section of the existing workforce approaching retirement.

Both issues need to be addressed, as a matter of urgency, if the industry is to meet rising demand in a timely and effective manner in the future.

[Slide 9]
However, one area where there is a high level of certainty is the oil resource base. There is no doubt that the world has enough resources of oil to satisfy consumers for decades to come.

Estimates from the US Geological Survey of ultimately recoverable reserves have practically doubled since the early 1980s, from just under 1.7 trillion barrels to over 3.3 trillion barrels — while cumulative production, during the same period, has been less than one-third of this increase.

Improved technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery have enabled the world to increase its resource base to levels well above the expectations of the past, and this will continue in the future.

However, there is still further to go with recovery rates, which average around 35 per cent globally. With the appropriate application of technology, recovery rates of double the present average are seen as achievable.

More than three-quarters of the world’s proven recoverable crude oil reserves lie in OPEC’s Member Countries, and these states are committed to ensuring that consumers receive their oil in a secure, orderly and sustainable manner. This is, of course, subject to the appropriate demand conditions being in place, and here I refer back to my comments about minimising uncertainty.

[Slide 10]
In addition to conventional oil, there is also a vast resource base of non-conventional oil to explore and develop. This includes heavy oil, tar sands, oil shale, gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids and biofuels. Their importance will grow over time, and the challenges lie more on the technological, environmental and economic hurdles regarding their production and processing.

This brings me onto the subject of biofuels.

The hard facts are that biofuels are increasingly in competition with land-use, water resources and, consequently, food. Also, there is very little benefit, in terms of greenhouse gas emission reductions.

All in all, the environmental aspects and sustainability of biofuels are being seriously questioned by many people and institutions at the present time, even in the oil-consuming regions.

[Slide 11]
Let me now focus on the environment and the need for oil production to meet the tightest regulations, addressing both local pollution and climate change concerns. The industry has made substantial progress in meeting these challenges in recent years, and further advances are expected in the future.

OPEC has been very committed to this, acting in many important areas. Indeed, last November, four of our Member Countries pledged a total of US $750 million towards research into energy and the environment.

Clearly, technology-based solutions are essential for a carbon-constrained world.

OPEC is a keen advocate of carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, a big leap forward is needed now, in terms of the development and deployment of this technology on a broader scale. This offers great potential for consuming countries, with their superior financial and technological resources.

While it is difficult to predict the pace and the extent of advances in technology, cooperation in this area should be treated as a high priority within the industry at large and supported by governments.

In addition, OPEC welcomes any measures that enhance the global energy mix. But people should be realistic about switching capital resources to developing renewables. Such resources could get better returns in developing cleaner fossil fuel technologies.

And finally, we must remember that energy is central to poverty eradication, sustainable development and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.

Even though oil consumption may double in the developing world by 2030, not all the countries in this group are benefiting from such growth. At the present time, an estimated 1.6 billion people across the world have no access to electricity, and 2.5 billion people still rely on traditional biomass for cooking.

We all have a responsibility to help poorer nations set out on the road to sustainable economic and social development, with access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sound energy services.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

[Slide 12]
During this address, I have discussed seven key issues affecting the industry today.

• Market speculation is a major cause of volatility and the rising prices of oil and other commodities.
• Market uncertainty is undermining the effectiveness of oil investment strategies.
• Urgent attention is needed for rising costs and skill shortages.
• The world has enough oil resources to meet increasing demand for decades to come.
• The sustainability of biofuels is being reassessed.
• A more intensive technology-based approach is required for addressing environmental concerns, such as CCS and cleaner oil technologies.
• Much effort should be directed to reduce energy poverty and improve access to modern energy services for all.

These issues will be best handled in a cohesive environment, with the full support of the international community, which is well-represented at the highest level in this Forum.

Energy interdependence calls for broader dialogue and well-targeted cooperation among all parties, as well as greater transparency and predictability.

Indeed, at the recent Third OPEC Summit, the Heads of State and Government of our Member Countries strengthened their resolve to in-depth dialogue and cooperation.

They have long recognised that this is essential, if the oil sector is to meet all its goals successfully in the future.

"2008-02-04","Thank you Mr Chairman for your introduction …

Ladies and gentleman, I am delighted to be here today to deliver this keynote address on ‘Energy Security and Supply’.

Let me begin this afternoon by putting forward the question: what does energy security actually mean? Of course, at OPEC we appreciate the importance of energy security and supply, the theme of this session. This is clearly visible in OPEC’s actions, something I will return to later. But I feel that when examining energy security we need to paint a more complete picture.

The reason is that globalisation is bringing us all closer together and there is no avoiding the fact that we live in an increasingly interdependent world. From the energy perspective, there is a shift away from longstanding self-interested views of energy security to a greater appreciation of its broader, more universal nature.

So allow me to put forward a brief OPEC perspective focused on a number of energy security characteristics …

Energy security should be reciprocal. It is a two-way street. Security of demand is as important to producers, as security of supply is to consumers;

It should be universal, applying to rich and poor nations alike, with the focus on the three pillars of sustainable development and in particular the eradication of poverty;

It should focus on providing all consumers with modern energy services;

It should apply to the entire supply chain. Downstream is as crucial as upstream;

It should cover all foreseeable time-horizons. Security tomorrow is as important as security today;

It should allow for the development and deployment of new technologies in a sustainable, economic and environmentally-sound manner; and

It should benefit from enhanced dialogue and cooperation among stakeholders.

Turning to the title of this session — ‘Energy Security and Supply’ — we appreciate that consuming countries’ concerns focus on the secure and predictable flow of energy. With this in mind, and regarding oil, I would like to make two things clear. Firstly, the fact that conventional and non-conventional petroleum resources are plentiful and increasing. For OPEC Member Countries, these resource figures can be viewed in our Annual Statistical Bulletin. And secondly, from OPEC’s perspective, we are ready, willing and able to supply oil – as we have always done.

Our Member Countries continue to increase their production capacity substantially and are accelerating plans to bring on-stream new projects, so as to respond to future demand, both at home and abroad, while offering a comfortable cushion of spare capacity, for the benefit of the world at large. Overall, they have already committed more than $150 billion towards a crude oil capacity expansion of up to 5 mb/d by the end of 2012.

And, where possible, they have been increasing their presence downstream, at home and abroad, to ease some of the severe bottlenecks that have emerged in the refining sectors of consumer countries in recent years. For example, major crude distillation refinery projects in OPEC Member Countries are expected to add over 3 mb/d of additional capacity by 2012, representing an investment of close to $50 billion.

These are huge investments for OPEC Member Countries that have other pressing demand, such as the provision of healthcare, education and basic economic infrastructure.

It is also important to note that petroleum revenue plays a central role in the economic and social development of our Member Countries, with 75 per cent of OPEC’s total export revenue coming from that source in 2006; for many of these countries, the figure even exceeded 90 per cent.

This is why they need assurances of secure oil markets, predictable demand and stable prices, and why, in particular, they have gone to great lengths over the years to achieve these.

Today, the markets continue to be well supplied with crude, commercial crude and product stocks remain within the five-year average, and there has been no recent interruption in crude supplies. However, we do recognise that in terms of price, the current level is not supported by market fundamentals and OPEC is concerned about this situation …The reasons behind this divergence need to be examined.

What is clear is that it is not just about high price levels. It is also about price volatility.

In the near term, this creates a climate of nervousness and uncertainty, eroding confidence among stakeholders in the industry and making everyday transactions more complex and unpredictable. For the longer term, it makes it very difficult to devise and implement effective investment strategies.

The present rising oil prices are being driven largely by market speculators. Oil has become a financial asset, like other commodities. In addition, persistent refinery bottlenecks, ongoing geopolitical problems and fluctuations in the US dollar, also continue to play a role in pushing oil prices higher.

Clearly, nobody gains from such a situation. Volatility is damaging to all responsible parties in the industry, on both the producer and consumer sides. It is because of this that OPEC constantly monitors the market’s activity and continues to seek a balance between supply and demand, as well as a fair, stable price that is acceptable to both consumers and producers.

OPEC attaches great importance to this, which can be viewed in the recent Riyadh Declaration that concluded the Third OPEC Summit of Heads of State and Government in the Saudi capital last November. The “stability of global energy markets” is one of the three principal themes of the Declaration, and the provision of “reliable, affordable and competitive energy supplies” is central to this.

The importance of stability is also clear when we look at energy security and demand. And what I should like to highlight here is that this goes hand-in-hand with energy security and supply. As the Riyadh Declaration also stated, there is a need to “underscore the interrelationships between global security of petroleum supply and the security and predictability of demand.” This is the business we are in.

Demand unpredictability can be viewed clearly when we look at the past. Here, I am talking about the price collapse and the halving of demand for OPEC oil in the 1980s. Many oil-producing countries were hit hard, leaving many heavily in debt and with much idle capacity. With vulnerable, single-product economies, it would take years for them to recover.

Thus, the huge investments OPEC Member Countries are making today, requires any demand uncertainties to be examined in detail. It is easy to see why.

To 2020, scenarios developed by the OPEC Secretariat highlight that the additional amount of oil required from OPEC ranges between 32 mb/d and almost 41 mb/d. In monetary terms, the corresponding range for Member Countries is somewhere between $230 billion and $500 billion, representing a huge uncertainty for Member Countries upstream investment requirements.

Existing policies and new initiatives that discriminate against oil, involving subsidies for other sources of energy, could impact oil demand in the short term but will not solve the overall production of energy security.

We welcome diversity in the overall energy mix, as well as the push to develop renewables. However, we need to give thought to how we proceed. For example, biofuels have recently been given impetus by fiscal and policy incentives, but the sustainability of large-scale supply and use of biofuels is becoming the subject of serious discussion, in terms of competition for land and scarce water resources, biodiversity and impacts on food prices. This I know is something being debated here in the UK.

The situation is also not helped, at the present time, by the low value of the US dollar, which means an erosion of purchasing power, and the uncertainties surrounding the global economy as the world continues to be impacted by the US subprime crisis. In addition, there are rising costs within the industry, as well as shortages of skilled labour.

What this means for producers is that there is a real prospect — in an industry with large upfront investment and long-lead times — of wasting precious resources on capacity that may not be needed. And on the other hand, without the confidence that additional demand for oil will emerge and the market signals that long-run prices are supportive, the incentive to invest can be reduced. This may lead to under investment and a situation where consumers’ needs are not met.

It all underlines the fact security of supply and security of demand cannot be decoupled. It is in our best interests to work together, and share the responsibility for a healthy and stable energy interdependent world.

This statement also touches on one of the other major global issues of the day: the protection of the environment. OPEC has long been active in this area, with regard to both local pollution and climate change and this was also a principal theme of the Riyadh Declaration. Indeed at the Summit, four Member Countries – Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE – announced that they would contribute a total of $750 million towards funding research into energy, the environment and climate change.

Given that fossil fuels will continue to satisfy the overwhelming share of the world’s commercial energy needs and that there are adequate resources, the challenge going forward is clear. It is making sure that the emphasis is placed on how to develop, produce, transport, refine and deliver oil to end-users in an efficient, timely, sustainable, economic, reliable and environmentally-sound manner.

Central to this is technological innovation. Technological progress and innovation have contributed much to the industry in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. Our Organization is an advocate of developing and deploying cleaner fossil fuel technologies, notably carbon capture and storage. It is a proven technology that will not only enhance energy security, but also significantly reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from conventional fossil fuels.

In this regard, it is important to emphasise that developed countries having the technological and financial capabilities, should take the lead in the development and deployment of these technologies, as well as in its transfer to developing countries.

Ladies and gentlemen,

In this address, I have explained how OPEC and its Member Countries are proactively responding to international concern about energy security and supply. In doing so, I hope I have been able to convey to you that we remain committed to ensuring secure, stable, reasonably priced supplies of crude oil to the market at all times, in support of sound economic growth and the general welfare of mankind.

Though, what should also be recognised is that in today’s world none of us can act alone. It is important that all stakeholders work together, and continually dialogue and cooperate. Those of us who are in the energy business have a responsibility to do everything we can to provide energy to those without, and at the same time maintain and enhance security and confidence in the sustainability of the energy system on which the whole world depends.

I thank you all.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/269-17-november-2007.html"
"2007-11-15","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to thank Ms JoAnne DiSano for her excellent background paper.

I fully agree with your conclusion, Ms DiSano, that there must be an integrated approach to energy for sustainable development, accommodating the three mutually-supportive pillars of economic development, social progress and environmental protection.

Energy is crucial for sustainable development. Indeed, increased use of energy, in particular fossil fuels, has allowed billions of people to see their living conditions improve, prosperity grow and life-expectancy increase.

But this has been mostly in developed countries. The story is very different elsewhere.

As you rightly emphasize, more than two billion people have no access to modern energy services. Instead, people living in the rural areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America, must rely on firewood, dung and plant residue. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 1.5 million people die each year from inhaling biomass smoke.

As was made clear in Johannesburg five years ago, poverty alleviation should remain an overriding priority.

And this means ensuring continuous access by the poor to affordable modern energy services.

This is a challenging target. And it is an achievable one, through: adopting balanced economic and social policies tailored to the needs of poorer nations; providing adequate financial support; developing and transferring affordable and environmentally-sound technologies; sharing knowledge and best practices; and, in general, ensuring that the eight UN Millennium Development Goals are met by the international community.

It is well known that energy use will grow by almost 50 per cent by 2030, due to rising populations, growing economies and improved living conditions.

To help meet this growing demand, all energy sources are welcome.

The contribution of renewables will remain modest in the foreseeable future,\ because of the competition, by some of them, for water and land otherwise required for food production.

In short, the world will continue to rely on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, to satisfy the energy needs of the growing populations and give them a better life.

But how can this be done in an environmentally friendly way?

There is no silver bullet. However, it is clear that a key element of the response is the development, deployment and transfer of cleaner fossil fuel technologies.

And how is OPEC handling such challenges?

First of all, let me stress that, just like anyone else, the citizens of our Member Countries wish to live in a cleaner, safer world, and, moreover, to pass this on to our future generations.

We are, therefore, acting on numerous fronts in this complex arena.

We aim to reduce our environmental footprint as much as possible.

Significant progress has been made with gas-flaring in recent years. Our Member Countries have ambitious programmes aimed at stopping this in the near future. Several Members are actively engaged in the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership.

Much has been done already to reduce tailpipe emissions from vehicles and to phase-out the use of lead.

Our Member Countries have been investing billions of US dollars in upgrading refineries to meet the most stringent product specifications.

OPEC has recently joined the International Energy Agency’s Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, whose purpose is to cover a wide range of technology options aimed at reducing such emissions.

More importantly, one of the three worldwide Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) demonstration projects is in an OPEC Member Country, Algeria. Other countries are exploring the possibility to widely use CO2 for enhanced oil recovery.

However, we believe that, over and above our own efforts, industrialized countries should take the lead in the funding and execution of large CCS demonstration projects, under the accepted principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me conclude by reminding you of OPEC’s most important role in sustainable development. This is to provide the fuel of choice, petroleum, to satisfy the world needs, in a reliable, secure, efficient and environmentally-sound manner. This, by itself, is already a great achievement — and it is repeated, without fail, every day.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/270-15-november-2007.html"

"2007-11-08","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to this gathering.

I am delighted to be able to participate in this important event, concerning the challenges facing a changing international energy market.

Maybe today, the challenge which comes first to mind is related to the price of oil. It is in all the news and it is indeed a subject of concern, both for consumers and producers alike. I would like to state clearly: OPEC considers both too high and too low oil prices as undesirable. High volatility is to the benefit of no one, except speculators.

The market remains well supplied with crude. There has been no recent interruption in crude supplies, and OECD commercial inventories remain above five-year average levels. They cover around 53 days of OECD consumption, which is more than comfortable.

Are today’s high oil prices the result of a shortage of crude? They are definitely not.

Why then do we have these high oil prices? I believe that, today, the reasons are not related to supply-demand fundamentals. Supply is sufficient and demand growth is moderate.

Other factors are in play, such as persistent refinery bottlenecks, ongoing geopolitical problems, a decline in the value of the US dollar, and most importantly, market speculation. Oil is now a financial asset, as other commodities. Large amounts of money are flowing into the commodities markets to balance portfolio risks and to seek higher returns.

Let us remember: the market faced a dramatic supply interruption in 2005, with the US losing most of its production and refining capacity in the Gulf of Mexico, due to hurricanes. Even then, the market did not witness such sharp price fluctuations as today.

This phenomenon has indeed been recognised as an area of concern to be addressed in our dialogue with the European Union. In this wonderful Hofburg Palace, nearly one year ago, OPEC and the EU held a joint two-day workshop on the ‘Impact of financial markets on the price of oil’, during which we discussed the adverse effects of speculators causing price trends to be exaggerated, such as high and sustained levels of volatility. One of the points that was emphasised was the role of regulation and the need for a supporting policy framework that would benefit all market participants.

We recognise the importance of markets, in particular for price discovery, as well as the need for liquidity. However, we do believe that excessive volatility is damaging to all responsible parties in the industry, on both the producer and consumer sides; in the shorter term, it makes everyday transactions more complex, unpredictable and erratic, while, in the longer term, it is seriously detrimental to effective investment strategies.

OPEC constantly monitors market activity and continues to seek a balance between supply and demand, as well as a fair, stable price that is acceptable to both consumers and producers.

Our Member Countries invest heavily in crude oil capacity, to ensure that markets are adequately supplied at all times and that there is a comfortable cushion of spare capacity, for the benefit of the world at large.

Capacity expansion plans already in place are expected to result in an increase of capacity by 2012 of over 5 million b/d, underpinned by more than 120 projects, and these are estimated today to correspond to more than US $150 billion.

In addition, many Member Countries are investing in the downstream, both inside and outside their borders, to help address the bottlenecks that have been troubling the industry in recent years.

Looking forward, our oil outlook reference case sees world oil demand rising by around 40% to 2030. Developing countries account for most of this rise and the transportation sector will be the main source of future oil demand.

Fortunately, the world’s oil resources are plentiful and sufficient to meet future demand.

In addition to crude, many other sources of oil will increasingly contribute to world supply: non-conventional oil, biofuels, natural gas liquids and others.

OPEC’s share in global oil supply by 2030 will not be very different from what it is today.

In addition, large uncertainties are associated with the demand for OPEC crude oil.

OPEC has the capability and the will to bring this oil to the market, as and when it is needed, but its Member Countries’ investment strategies are confronted by a major obstacle, in the shape of uncertainty over the amount of oil that will be required in the future. Much of this uncertainty stems from consuming countries’ policies.

Uncertainty can prove extremely costly for oil producers, especially with the long lead-times and payback periods involved. OPEC has looked into this matter carefully, and its alternative lower- and higher-growth scenarios show, for example, that, even over the medium term to 2010, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment in the OPEC upstream, increasing to $160 billion by 2015.

It must be noted here that petroleum accounts for 75 per cent of OPEC’s export revenue, averaged out across the 12 Members, and, for five of these countries, it exceeds 95 per cent. Therefore, they are heavily dependent upon oil revenue for their economic and social development and want to be certain that it is invested well, benefiting their citizens, rather than being diverted to expanding production capacity to levels that are ultimately not needed.

This brings me back to the title of my address — “Balancing the interests of producing and consuming countries”. This is essential if the industry is to successfully meet the day-to-day challenges of the market, as well as cater for the needs of the future.

Furthermore, it is the responsibility of all of us, regardless of our position in the supply chain.

Of central importance here are the oil companies. The contrasting roles of national and international oil companies (NOCs and IOCs) have evolved over the past three decades. This has, for example, resulted in differing levels of participation by the IOCs in the upstream sectors of oil-producing countries and an appreciable level of participation by NOCs in the downstream, both domestically and abroad.

Also, the oil industry is more integrated than it used to be, vertically and horizontally, and major advances in such areas as communications, technology, and dialogue and cooperation have eased some of the barriers and structural rigidities that existed in the past.

OPEC attaches great importance to the NOC/IOC relationship. We believe that successful collaboration between these actors can play an important role in helping the industry meet the challenges that face it.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me close by referring briefly to the important issue of dialogue, which is fundamental to achieving balance within the oil industry. Many advances have been recently made in dialogue. OPEC has formal dialogues with the EU, China, IEA and others. OPEC is also actively involved within the International Energy Forum, which is based in Riyadh and constitutes a key component of producer-consumer dialogue. This evolution is conducive to establishing a consensus on, at least, the major issues that concern all parties — such as market stability, security of demand and supply, investment, and sustainable development.

Clearly, the industry is much better-off when there is such a consensus. It will help us find the right balance in handling such issues and it is essential for the healthy evolution of the oil industry in the years ahead.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/272-8-november-2007.html"
"2007-10-20","OPEC would like to reiterate to the distinguished delegates attending the IMFC its continued commitment to maintaining oil market stability. This commitment is exemplified in the recent decision taken at the OPEC Ministerial Conference to increase crude oil production despite considerable uncertainty about the actual market requirements. This decision provides a clear demonstration of the Organization’s ongoing concern about the health of the world economy, as well as its long-standing commitment to ensure adequate supplies in the market.

Since the last meeting of the IMFC, crude oil prices have experienced considerable volatility. From March until the end of July, the OPEC Reference Basket rose steadily, reaching $73.67/b on 20 July. Prices fell sharply by $6/b in the first two weeks of August before rebounding again to a record high of $77.46/b on 12 October, although due to the strong depreciation of the US dollar, the price hike was felt differently in different currencies. Among the main factors contributing to this high volatility have been the continued downstream tightness exacerbated by a series of unexpected refinery outages in the USA, which have led to exceptionally low gasoline inventories, particularly over the driving season. Geopolitical developments and the Atlantic storm season have also contributed to higher prices as have increased speculative activity in the crude oil futures market, which magnifies the impact of other factors. The weaker dollar also supported prices, encouraging new investment in the futures market from non-dollar investors. It should be noted that throughout this period, crude oil inventories have remained at comfortable levels, at time well-above the five-year range, an indication that the crude oil market continues to be well supplied.

Apart from these factors, the recent price volatility reflects the growing economic uncertainties in the wake of the recent financial turbulence, which have further clouded the outlook for the US and world economic growth, and hence demand for oil. Like other organisations OPEC is monitoring the regional and global economic conditions very carefully. The recent credit squeeze will certainly have an effect on the real economy; however, the lag before the full impact is felt along with the time it will take for the credit market to re-price risk and the real economy to adjust remains unclear as the situation is still unfolding. Fortunately, the turmoil catches the world economy at a time of strength when the negative shocks can be endured more easily.

At present, our forecasts reflect a continued strong world economy, with growth expected at 5.1% in 2007 and at a slightly lower but still healthy pace of 4.9% in 2008. As it is still too early to gauge the extent of the negative effects of the current credit crunch on economic prospects in the US and globally, there is a need to continue to carefully monitor developments in the financial markets and their impact on the real economy. Much will depend on the efforts of monetary authorities to contain the crisis as well as the reaction of consumers, businesses and financial institutions in the coming months.

These economic uncertainties have already had an impact on the outlook for world oil demand, with the potential for significant revisions to growth numbers in the coming quarters. World oil demand is estimated to increase by 1.3 mb/d in 2007 and continue at the same level in 2008. Transport and industrial fuels are expected to show the strongest sectoral growth rates in 2008 while non-OECD countries are expected to account for almost 80% of incremental world oil demand, mainly from Asia, specifically China, India and the Middle East. OECD oil demand growth is expected to come primarily from North America. In addition the economic outlook, weather-related uncertainties and geopolitics remain the key wild card for oil demand growth in the coming quarters.

Non-OPEC supply has experienced continuous downward revisions this year since the initial forecast. A key factor behind the downward revisions have been project delays due to higher service costs and the complexity of most new projects. Deeper and heavier than planned field maintenance and a general trend toward extended field shut-downs have contributed to lower-than-expected growth. From an initial forecast of 1.1 mb/d, non-OPEC supply in 2007 is now expected to grow by 0.8 mb/d. For 2008, non-OPEC supply is forecast to increase by 1.1 mb/d. Additionally, OPEC NGLs and non-conventional oils —which are not included in OPEC crude oil production figures — are expected to grow by 330,000 b/d to 4.4 mb/d in 2007 and by 520,000 b/d in 2008.

Despite lower than expected non-OPEC supply, crude oil inventories remain at comfortable levels overall. The most recent data at the end of August show total OECD commercial oil stocks are 68 mb above the five-year average. In terms of days of forward cover — which takes into account demand expectations — this corresponds to a healthy level above 53 days. In the US, crude oil stocks have declined since August. This is mainly due to declining crude oil imports and the re-emergence of backwardation in the crude futures market, after more than two years in contango, which has removed economic incentives to stockpile oil. Despite the recent declines, US crude oil inventories are still more than 28 mb above the five-year average. The pressure on crude oil inventories could ease in the coming weeks as crude oil demand declines with US and European refiners moving into a relatively heavy maintenance schedule, taking as much as 2 million barrels of refinery capacity out of the market. However, this would not help improve the ongoing tightness in the US product market, which is likely to persist in the coming year as refining capacity is not projected to increase until the end of 2008.

The large uncertainties surrounding both non-OPEC supply and world oil demand have translated into even larger uncertainties regarding the demand for OPEC crude. Despite the uncertainties about the volume of crude oil required, OPEC decided at its September Ministerial Conference held in Vienna to increase production by half a million barrels per day effective 1 November. The OPEC Conference is scheduled to meet again in Abu Dhabi on 5 December to review the market situation and has expressed its readiness to respond swiftly if needed to any developments which might undermine oil market stability.

In addition to increasing current supply to the market, OPEC Member Countries are also continuing to invest to expand their crude oil production capacity. As a result, OPEC spare capacity in the coming quarters is expected to rise above 10%, providing a comfortable cushion to meet unexpected supply shortages. Such levels should reassure the market that OPEC is ready and willing to meet the needs of the world oil market.

Moreover, the upcoming Third Summit of Heads of State and Government of OPEC Member Countries, which will take place in November in Saudi Arabia, will provide further long-term guidance to enhance OPEC’s stabilizing role in the market; reinforce its continued commitment to meaningful dialogue and cooperative efforts with consuming nations; and ensure adequate supplies to meet the growing energy needs for sustainable development.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/273-20-october-2007.html"
"2007-09-13","Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

It gives me great pleasure to present to you today the 2007 OPEC World Oil Outlook.

Allow me to turn straight to some of the main take-aways from this publication.

Firstly, it is clear that energy demand is set to grow for the foreseeable future. Moreover, oil is expected to maintain its leading position in the energy mix.

Demand growth is stronger in developing countries throughout the period; however, oil use per capita will remain well below that of OECD countries.

In meeting this demand, the resource base is clearly sufficient, and both OPEC crude and other sources of oil supply will increase. However, there are considerable uncertainties that might affect the demand for OPEC oil in the future. This signifies a heavy burden of investment risk and a large uncertainty over future OPEC member countries’ oil-related export revenues.

In our assessment, we also identify the downstream as being important for market stability, probably more today and in the future than in the past.

The outlook also highlights that increased use of fossil fuels could be made compatible with the protection of the environment, in particular through the use of cleaner fossil fuel technologies, such as carbon capture and storage.

Finally, another feature that emerges from this assessment is the increasing energy and economic interdependence between nations, which is a welcome development, as interdependence is the way forward for enhanced energy supply and demand security.

This graph shows how, in the reference case, energy demand increases by an annual average rate of 1.7%, rising by more than 50% by 2030 compared to 2005.

Fossil fuels will continue to provide more than 90% of the world’s total commercial energy needs.

Oil will remain the leading source of energy, with its current share declining only slightly over the next two decades.

Gas is expected to continue to grow at fast rates, steadily approaching coal in its importance in the energy mix, although coal has seen impressive recent growth.

The total contribution of hydropower, nuclear and new renewables will remain relatively modest, despite the extreme high growth rates for some renewables.

Turning specifically to oil demand, the reference case sees demand rise by 34 mb/d from 2005 to 2030, reaching 118 mb/d by 2030, which translates into an annual average increase of 1.4 mb/d.

As can be seen from this slide, developing countries are set to account for most of this rise, with consumption doubling from 29 mb/d to 58 mb/d.

Nevertheless, throughout the years to 2030, developed countries will continue to consume more oil than developing nations.

However, as shown on this figure, oil consumption on a per capita basis continues to throw up sharp contrasts. As we can see, by 2030, North America will be consuming close to 20 barrels per person annually, and Western Europe over 10 barrels, whereas China will be using just 4 barrels per head, while other Asian countries will be at even lower levels, below two barrels per capita.

Focussing upon demand by sector, transportation will be the main source of future oil demand increases, by 18 mb/d over the period 2005-2030, or at an annual average rate of over 0.7 mb/d, slightly higher than over the past 25 years.

In the OECD, transportation demand is expected to continue to rise, by 4 mb/d to 2030, while in developing countries, demand from the transportation sector will rise by 13 mb/d. This illustrates in particular the greater potential for growth of the stock of vehicles in developing countries, where car ownership is still far below those levels seen in OECD countries.

This graph also demonstrates that no significant growth in oil demand can be expected in the electricity generation sector. Some increases are expected, however, in the industrial and residential sectors, for example as urbanisation supports the gradual shift away from traditional fuels.

Turning to the supply side, as I have mentioned, we see resources as being sufficient to meet future demand. Ultimately recoverable reserves of conventional oil have practically doubled since the early 1980s. In addition, there is a vast resource base of non-conventional oil to explore and develop.

In meeting the growing demand, both OPEC crude and other sources of oil supply will rise.

The call on OPEC crude by 2010 will likely not exceed 2005 levels in the reference case. In the longer term, OPEC crude oil supply rises, to reach 49 mb/d by 2030. Other sources of oil increase to 69 mb/d by 2030 in the reference case. This means that OPEC crude will account for around 40% of world oil supply by then, not far different from the situation today, while other sources of oil supply will account for close to 60%.

Of these other sources, increases will come mainly from a rise in crude oil supply from Brazil, Russia and the Caspian, and increases in biofuels and other alternatives and Canadian non-conventional oil, compensating for declines elsewhere, in particular the North Sea.

OPEC non-crude supply, primarily natural gas liquids, is also set to rise strongly.

The reference case sees more than 10 mb/d of non-conventional oil supply plus biofuels coming from non-OPEC by 2030, 8 mb/d more than in 2005, as demonstrated in this figure.

Biofuels are a welcome addition to the diverse sources of oil supply. Nevertheless, the potential growth for biofuels supply must be balanced against sustainability issues.

The impacts of large-scale production and trade of biofuels must be addressed in terms of land-use changes, competition with food supply and water resources, and impacts upon biodiversity.

Even the impact of large scale biofuels use on air quality in urban areas has not yet been fully assessed.

Moreover, greenhouse gas mitigation costs using biofuels are extremely high, and, in many regions, the energy and environmental balance of these fuels is negative.

Let me turn now to alternative scenarios.

This slide shows estimated required OPEC crude oil under three scenarios, and clearly illustrates the wide range of possible demand levels for OPEC oil.

By 2020, the range of demand of OPEC crude is as high as 41 mb/d or as low as 32 mb/d, that is an uncertainty range of 9 mb/d.

By 2030, while the reference case sees OPEC crude at 49 mb/d, a lower growth scenario leads to only 36 mb/d of OPEC crude being required.

In addition, we see downside risks to demand being more substantial than upside potential.

Moreover, recent pronouncements of ambitious biofuel targets amplify uncertainties for future demand for OPEC oil.

Here we see how uncertainties over future oil demand translate into a wide range of possible levels of necessary investment in OPEC member countries. Even over the medium-term to 2010, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment in the upstream, increasing to $140 billion by 2015.

The issue of security of demand is therefore a real one, and is a legitimate concern for OPEC Member Countries. Why?

Well, firstly, there is the very real prospect of wasting precious resources on capacity that would not be needed.

Secondly, a possible effect of the emergence of large levels of unused capacity would be downward pressures upon oil prices, resulting in a huge loss of revenues; and OPEC Member Countries, as developing countries, would be adversely affected in terms of available resources for education, healthcare, infrastructure, and so on.

Thirdly, lower revenues would, in turn, negatively affect available resources for future investment, with further subsequent market instability a distinct possibility.

On the other hand, another implication of this uncertainty can be to raise questions over whether future capacity will be sufficient.

All of this demonstrates the inseparability of security of demand and security of supply.

Let me now turn to the important element of the supply chain of refining.

In addition to increased demand for refined products and the resulting need for distillation capacity expansion, there is globally a continued move towards lighter and cleaner products. Thus, the downstream sector will require significant investment to ensure that sufficient distillation capacity is in place supported by adequate conversion and desulphurisation.

However, scenarios for refining needs, as reflected by the orange range in the slide, compared with scenarios for distillation capacity additions in the coming years (represented by the columns) indicate a continuing tightness in the refining sector, at least up to 2010. This is on top of expected persistent tightness in conversion and hydrotreating.

Global downstream investment requirements related to the expansion and maintenance of required refining capacity up to 2020 are projected to be $450 billion in the reference case.

Moreover, inter-regional oil trade should increase by 13 mb/d, with trade patterns evolving towards an increased importance of Asia as a crude and products import hub.

Despite challenges that include rising costs, shortages in skilled labour and experienced professionals, rapidly changing policies that put a strong emphasis on alternative fuels, and other policy initiatives that make demand prospects uncertain, OPEC Member Countries are investing in both the upstream and the downstream.

In the upstream sector, over 120 projects amounting to investments of more than $120 billion are expected to increase crude production capacity by more than 5 mb/d by 2012 from current levels.

In the downstream, while the main responsibility for expansion lies with consuming countries, existing projects in Member Countries should result in more than 3 mb/d of additional distillation capacity by 2012, with investment levels exceeding $60 billion.

All of this is a clear demonstration of OPEC’s commitment to supporting oil market stability.

No discussion of the World Oil Outlook is complete without addressing the need for environmental protection, one of the three pillars of sustainable development, together with economic development and social progress. The oil industry has a long history of success in developing and introducing cleaner oil technologies, cleaner products, reduced flaring, and so on. Indeed, the trend for more stringent fuel quality specifications is set to continue.

At the global level, expected increases in CO2 emissions give rise to concerns over possible impacts upon the climate. This points to the need for developing, deploying and transferring cleaner fossil fuel technologies. One example is the technology of carbon capture and storage, with its large potential for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions at relatively low cost. To this end, developed countries bear a historic responsibility, and, with the means at their disposal, should take the lead.

So, some concluding remarks. Firstly, increasing interdependence between nations is a fact – and it is important to recognise that energy security is a two-way street, with security of demand the flip side of the coin of security of supply.

Climate change concerns mean that we must make the consumption of fossil fuels consistent with a carbon-constrained future.

In the quest for sustainable development, the overriding priority is poverty eradication facilitated, to an extent, by improved access to modern energy services. In this regard, it is useful to recall the role played by our sister organisation, The OPEC Fund for International Development, or OFID. Indeed, you may have noticed the World map in our foyer, which documents the presence throughout the globe of this important organization.

I would also like to reiterate that OPEC is committed to supporting market stability as, indeed, was reaffirmed in its Long-Term Strategy that was adopted by the Ministerial conference in September 2005, copies of which are also available.

Finally, open, positive, pragmatic dialogue with all parties must constitute the main means of turning future challenges into opportunities. The World Oil Outlook can be seen as an integral part of that process.

Thank you for your attention, I’d be happy to take any questions you may have.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/274-13-september-2007.html"
"2007-09-13","OPEC first published its Annual Statistical Bulletin in 1965. At the time, the bulletin was intended only for the use of staff at the Secretariat and in MCs. Several years later, it became available for public distribution. Through the years the content and layout were also improved. Since 1994, a digital copy was included in the bulletin, first as a floppy diskette, and now as a CD-ROMs. Also since the year 2000 it is available in internet and intranet.

Data for OPEC Member Countries are based on official sources such as government ministries and national oil companies. OPEC Secretariat maintains direct data communication, both on monthly basis and through the dispatch of its Annual Questionnaire. We also request for data on various topics of research through specially designed questionnaires.

I would like to emphasize here that continuous improvement on data quality takes place using various means, which include regular meetings of the Working Party on Flow of Statistics where representatives of MCs responsible for data submission discuss areas of concern with members of DSD. In addition regular visits by the Secretariat to Member Countries are organized through which the statisticians get a chance to know their counterparts.

As I mentioned earlier, the tables in ASB are grouped into 5 sections. First section includes the summary tables about the various socio-economic as well as oil industry data with an emphasis on OPEC MCs. The data in this section go back as far as to 1986 in print and 1960 in the electronic version. Second section presents oil and gas data, detailing upstream and downstream activities, with emphasis not only on OPEC but also leading countries within each category.

Section 3 contains data on developments in transportation capacities and freight rates, while Sections 4 offers tables on the prices of crude and petroleum products. Finally Section 5 presents information on the evolution of financial and operational indicators related to the activities of the major oil companies.

Let me move on to the second part of my presentation by showing some graphs on selected topics contained in the ASB. (read slide)

This slide shows the evolution of OPEC’s oil export revenues. Although the nominal value of 2006 is considerably above the high values achieved in the early 1980s, in real terms, it is almost at the same level as during those years.

Let me highlight some of the data on reserves.

The share of OPEC Member Countries in World's proven crude oil reserves is 77%. The major part of it lies in OPEC Middle East, which accounts for 61% of Total World Reserves.

In addition to its high share in oil reserves, OPEC Member countries also hold a high share, namely 49%, of total World gas reserves. Two Member Countries namely, Iran and Qatar, account for the biggest share.

This graph indicates the trend in the upstream activities as measured by the number of drilling rigs in the Non-OPEC and in OPEC Member countries. It clearly shows a significant rise in the OPEC drilling activity since 2004. It shows OPEC’s commitment to create a balanced market situation, even though this period was accompanied with a very steep rise in the costs of drilling rigs.

Let me now proceed to crude oil production.

Although they are the most important crude oil producers, only in the mid-70s OPEC MCs accounted for more than half of world production. The share went down to its lowest level in mid-80s, but has then started to increase again and currently stands at 44.5%.

Total world crude oil production has increased by 4.7 mb/d during the last three years. Over 91% of the additional production needed to meet the increasing demand has come from OPEC during this period. Besides the FSU, and a few other countries like Brazil, Ecuador and China contributed to the increase, while at the same time in the US and the North Sea production fell by over 1.6 mb/d.

I could also add here that our Member Countries have been advancing their production capacity expansion plan. Within the next 5 years, we will have the capacity to supply additional 4-5 mbpd of crude oil, with another 1.5 mbd of NGL. This should be more than adequate, and would leave reasonable spare capacity, at the projected demand growth over the coming 5 years.

How about the downstream activities?

On refinery sectors, ASB data show that the growth of refinery capacity for the last 20 years has taken place only in Asia and OPEC MCs, while other major markets specially USA have remained relatively stagnant.

This graph is indicative of investment activities of the major international oil companies, the dominant players in North America and Europe. As ASB2006 shows, although petroleum product margins have been growing rapidly in recent years, oil company investments have been concentrated mostly in the upstream sector.

Companies considered include: Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, Total, Chevron.

Let me now move on to our data on consumption

Our ASB2006, noted that world refined product consumption has been constantly increasing during the last 20 years. Biggest consumers remain North America and Europe, while developing countries, especially China and India have grown significantly and became more important oil consumers.

Finally a last word to exports.

This higher rate of crude imports from OPEC MCs can mainly be attributed to rising demand in China and India where energy consumption is growing rapidly.

Also Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, who together represent a significant economic and trading center, are strongly dependent on oil imports.

And one should not forget the smaller countries in the region which are, from an energy point of view, in an upswing phase.

Finally a last word to exports.

Ladies and Gentlemen, as you see, the ASB, not only provides a comprehensive source of data on oil and gas industry, but it also illustrates the vital role of OPEC in that industry. I am sure that you will even find more interesting information as you go through the Bulletin.

In the meantime, OPEC Secretariat intends to further improve the ASB. With the support of our Member Countries, we will maintain the reputation of our Annual Statistical Bulletin as a valuable source of data.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/275-13-september-2007.html"
"2007-05-10","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to share with you the following messages:

1. OPEC strongly supports dialogue between energy producers and consumers, at the same time as pursuing its longstanding objective of greater market stability. Both policies have a positive impact on the prospects of sustainable development for all, developing and developed countries alike;

2. OPEC welcomes greater diversity in the energy mix;

3. Energy should be used more effectively and efficiently;

4. The development and deployment of cleaner fossil fuel technologies, including carbon capture and storage, are crucial for sustainable development.

It is important to recall what was clearly expressed in Johannesburg in 2002, that the eradication of poverty is the greatest challenge facing the world today, and that access to energy facilitates the eradication of poverty.

I am sure you are all acquainted with the following basic facts:

Access to modern energy services is essential for poverty eradication and sustainable development, and plays a crucial role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals we have all pledged to reach.

In OPEC, we welcome any diversification in the energy mix, which can contribute to reaching the Millennium Development Goals and sustainable development. We believe that the introduction of new fuels, such as biofuels, could be a good step forward. However, their contribution towards meeting the world’s energy needs will remain modest, at best. Furthermore, their expansion will create greater competition for land, water and food, and this is detrimental to the Millennium Development Goals.

It is clear that fossil fuels will continue to satisfy the lion’s share of the world’s growing energy needs for decades to come. Demand for energy is expected to increase by more than 50 per cent by 2030, and most of that increase will be provided by fossil fuels. Cumulative total investment requirements in energy are estimated to be in the order of US $20 trillion. 40 per cent of this, or some $8 trillion, is needed in the oil and natural gas sectors. Therefore, if we are to tackle climate change with the sense of urgency that is being called for in many quarters, it is important to continue to promote the development and deployment of cleaner fossil fuel technologies.

In this connection, carbon capture and storage is an existing technology, with the potential to contribute up to 40 per cent of emission reductions by the middle of the century. However, industrialised countries, having the financial and technological capabilities, should take the lead in developing and deploying this technology.

With today’s technology, petroleum provides the most accessible, useable and affordable energy source for many countries seeking to develop and modernise their economies. Fuels derived from petroleum have become increasingly cleaner over the years.

As was clearly expressed in Johannesburg in 2002, the eradication of poverty is the greatest challenge facing the world today. In particular, urgent action is required to reduce indoor air pollution from traditional biomass cooking and heating, through access to modern energy services.

It is clear that, in taking on such a challenge, we must all work together to achieve a balanced, and realistic outcome— and, perhaps most importantly, a sustainable one — at this session is essential. Developing countries will need more energy, and not less, to meet their social and economic needs. And so we must all play our part in achieving a sustainable world.

Finally, OPEC believes that the legitimate interests and views of oil-producing developing countries, which supply the world with a valuable, exhaustible natural resource, should be considered at all times in multilateral discussions involving energy, development and the environment.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/276-10-may-2007.html"
"2007-05-08","","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/277-8-may-2007.html"
"2007-05-07","Ladies and gentlemen,

1. I should like to thank you Excellency, for inviting OPEC to this side event of Vienna-based intergovernmental organisations.

Let me say too that OPEC has enjoyed the excellent hospitality provided by the Federal Republic of Austria and the City of Vienna for more than four decades. We look forward to continuing this relationship well into the future.

2. My contribution is about the dialogue between energy producers and consumers. With three messages:

3. The world is indeed increasingly interdependent. We are in an era of globalisation, expanding international trade, instant mass communications, interconnected financial markets, rapidly advancing technology and greater mobility. Total world energy exports have more than doubled over the past two decades, rising faster than GDP.

4. Looking ahead, our reference case projections to 2030 show that global energy demand will increase by more than 50%, and around 1.7 per cent annually. It also highlights that fossil fuels will continue to provide more than 90 per cent of the world’s total commercial energy needs, with oil remaining the leading source in the global energy mix, with a 36 per cent share.

5. Our projections also indicate that there will be even greater interdependence in the future. For example, in volume terms, trade in crude and oil products is expected to rise by more than 25 per cent over the years to 2020 alone.

Thus, the energy system, which is already a global one, is even more global, complex and interconnected in the future. This is all the more true that relationships are becoming more complex with the development of bio-fuels, which will create new links between energy supply and food supply, as described in an earlier speech, with the risks of one system being compounded with the risks of the other system. Consequently, there is no room for an independent approach to energy supply.

6. Let me now emphasise my second message, that energy security is very much a two-way street. On the one hand, oil is important to the economic growth and prosperity of consuming/importing countries, but on the other hand it is also crucial to the development and social progress of producing/exporting countries. For example, while net oil imports in OECD countries account for around 60 per cent of their total demand, oil exports from OPEC’s Member Countries account for no less than 77 per cent of their total exports, and for some of them, more than 90%.

The concern of consuming countries for the secure flow of oil at reasonable and stable prices is matched by the concern of producers for predictable demand, at adequate prices for their exhaustible resources, in order to provide the much needed revenues for their socio-economic development, with access to markets and non-discrimination against their products.

7. OPEC is well acquainted with the issue of energy security. It is enshrined in its Statute and refers to the necessity of its Member Countries securing “an efficient, economic and regular supply of (oil) to consuming nations”.

We have seen some successful examples of this recently, with OPEC’s decisions to increase production and accelerate capacity-expansion plans, after the sharp rise in demand in 2004, and following the large and lengthy hurricane-caused supply interruptions from the US in 2005.

8. OPEC’s Member Countries possess around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves. As such, they are acutely aware of the role they can play in ensuring that the consumers continue to receive their oil in a timely, efficient and orderly manner. And, OPEC is totally committed to carrying out this role.

9. On the other hand, OPEC is facing large uncertainties over how future oil demand plays out and over the amount that it will eventually need to supply, signifying a heavy burden of risk. For example, up to 2020, our scenarios highlight the fact that these countries’ upstream investment requirements could lie within a huge range of US $230 billion and $500 bn — competing with funds required for such areas as health, education and infrastructure. Furthermore, a large amount of idle capacity would put much downward pressure on prices and be detrimental to vital export revenue.

In fact, the risks have heightened recently. For example, recent policy initiatives, in the European Union and the United States of America, that discriminate against oil, involving subsidies for competing fuels and higher taxes, may see even lower demand for oil products in general, and for OPEC oil in particular.

Many of these policies are packaged as environmentally-driven. But we all know that increased use of fossil fuels is consistent with the protection of the environment, through the development and dissemination of advanced cleaner fossil fuel technologies, and in particular the promising technology of carbon capture and storage.

10. Let me turn to my third message. When we look at all the challenges facing the energy system today and in the future, it is clear that strengthening and deepening the dialogue and cooperation among producers and consumers is extremely important. I am glad to say that much progress has been made with dialogue and cooperation since the early 1990s.

Over the past 15 years, OPEC has also been actively involved in the establishment and development of the foremost producer/consumer dialogue at the political level, the International Energy Forum. It is a process of informal, global dialogue on energy at the level of ministers involving at present some 60 key energy countries. It also involves the industry within the Business Forum.

Moreover, the Forum has set up in 2003 a Secretariat, based in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is also the home of the Joint Oil Data Initiative, which OPEC has helped develop with other five intergovernmental organisations, into an internationally-recognised entity, whose focus is on advancing the transparency, quality, timeliness and flows of energy market data.

11. OPEC has recently expanded and enhanced dialogue with , for example, the EU, China, Russia, Japan and the International Energy Agency.

The EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue has been particularly dynamic. Three Ministerial Summits has been held, up to now. Workshops on oil markets, on the impacts of financial markets on the price of oil have also been held. A joint Roundtable on Carbon Capture and Storage has been organised in Riyadh in September last year, as both groupings consider this technology as an extremely promising mean to reduce GHG emissions in the future. A joint study on refining is also being conducted.

12. With China, regular Roundtables are being held to exchange views on OPEC and Chinese energy policies. Similar Roundtables are also held with Japan.

13. Cooperation with the IEA has also been strengthened, with in particular an annual joint workshop being organised, the forthcoming being held this month in Bali, Indonesia. OPEC is also joining the IEA GHG R&D Programme, a programme which focuses on the technology of carbon capture and storage.

14. Dialogue with other producers is also important. One could mention the annual meetings with Russia as well as the OPEC-non-OPEC producing country meetings.

15. With developing countries, over the years, OPEC’s Member States have sought to ease the plight of such countries in diverse ways and have established many effective bilateral and multilateral cooperation and aid institutions. These include our sister organisation, the OPEC Fund for International Development, also based in Vienna, which is active in no less than 119 developing countries.

It is our belief in OPEC, all members being developing countries, that, as stated in Johannesburg, poverty eradication is the greatest challenge facing the world today.

16. Let me sum up by saying that OPEC is convinced that in this increasingly interdependent world, dialogue and cooperation are the way forward.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/278-7-may-2007.html"
"2007-05-02","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let me start by thanking HE Ali Al-Naimi for inviting me to participate in this distinguished gathering of Ministers from across the East and West Asia region. I have very much enjoyed the presentations here today on such an important topic as the energy and economic interdependence between East and West Asia and I look forward to the discussions that follow.

It is easy to see how the regions of East and West Asia complement each other. This stems from their closeness geographically, their peaceful coexistence over many centuries, their close trade ties and technology expertise, and from the shared oil supply and demand perspective. It is the latter I will concentrate on today.

Going forward, the Asian region is expected to see the biggest energy and oil demand growth rates of any region in the world. In OPEC’s reference case scenario world oil demand is expected to climb from 85 mb/d in 2007 to 118 mb/d in 2030. Developing countries comprise most of this rise and more than two-thirds of this growth will be in Asian developing countries. By 2030, Asian oil demand is expected to rise to 43 mb/d, an increase of around 18 mb/d.

This demand will of course be driven by regional economic growth; in a similar manner to recent years. For example, in terms of GDP growth over the past year, China has grown over 10 per cent, India over eight per cent, Indonesia and Malaysia over five per cent, and South Korea and Thailand just under five per cent.

On the supply side, to the East there is Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, all OPEC Member Countries (MCs), as well as other suppliers such as Bahrain and Oman. The region supplies a significant share of the world’s oil and also holds considerable reserves. In fact, taken as a whole, OPEC MCs today hold approximately 78 per cent of the world’s proven crude oil reserves with much of this in the Middle East.

Bringing these two strands together it is clear that East and West Asia interdependence is already clearly defined. The two regions are mutually supportive. This is further emphasised by the fact that if we take crude oil exports for Asia, Europe and the US, OPEC supplies more to Asia than the other two regions combined. At present, almost 50 per cent of OPEC oil exports are bound for Asia.

What all this points to is the fact that any talk of energy security must take into account both supply and demand perspectives. The role of oil is equally important to the economic growth and prosperity of consuming-importing countries, as well as to the development and social progress of producing-exporting countries.

The concern for consuming countries is for the secure and predictable flow of oil at reasonable prices. I would like to stress up front that OPEC is ready, willing and able to supply oil – as it always has done – and there are still plentiful reserves.

For producing countries, concerns centre on demand uncertainties. For example, to 2020, scenarios developed by the OPEC Secretariat highlight that the additional amount of oil required from OPEC could range by close to 9 mb/d. In monetary terms, the corresponding range for MCs is somewhere between $230 billion and $500 billion, representing a huge uncertainty for MCs upstream investment requirements, all with competing needs in such areas as health, education and infrastructure. In addition, a large amount of idle capacity would put much downward pressure on prices and be detrimental to vital export revenues.

With these figures in mind, it is easy to appreciate the importance of producers and other investors having a fair idea of how much will be required and who their main consumers will be so that they may invest with confidence.

The uncertainties also impact the downstream, which is currently witnessing much tightness. It is interesting to note going forward that the largest number of capacity additions and investments are taking place in Asia and the Middle East, but as with the upstream timely investment needs to take into account policy initiatives. For example, uncertainties related to the levels of future products demand and non-refined supplies are currently resulting in additional risks, for a sector traditionally characterised by low margins and high volatility.

In response to meeting this upstream and downstream investment challenge we also recognise the importance of cross investments, particularly in the East and West Asia region. New refining capacities in Asia will be increasingly dependent on incremental supply from the West and thus cooperation in product movements in areas such as the physical swaps for supply and the sharing of storage infrastructure will be significant. We need to build relationships beyond just the buyer and seller.

We also hope to see enhanced relationships among National Oil Companies (NOCs), as well as between NOCs and International Oil Companies (IOCs). For example, in today’s environment we need to look at collaboration on technological options that allow the continued use of fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained world, such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).

Elsewhere we also need to aid further information exchange and help evolve larger and more developed research and development networks. One particular area of global concern is that surrounding manpower development and training as a large shortage of engineers and other key personnel is threatening the timely completion of essential projects. Furthermore, such cooperation can also help bring down the high costs of services, which are creating further pressure on well-devised output expansion strategies.

It is also important that we look to continually develop and explore existing and new avenues of cooperation at the level of governments and international organizations. Efforts at expanding dialogues are something our Organization has, and continues to devote much energy to. The most recent result of this was the establishment of energy dialogues between OPEC and a number of other industry stakeholders: the EU, China, Russia, a number of other non-OPEC producers and the IEA.

This year will also witness OPEC broadening its talks in the Asian region. In late March, there was a meeting with the Asian Refinery Community in Bangkok, and early talks will be held with Japanese officials from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Tokyo.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

The regions of East and West Asia already have some excellent economic and energy links. And the relationship from the perspective of the oil market is very much complementary. We need each other. By this I do not mean only as producers and consumers, but as partners. It is important that together we make the right decisions for our futures, particularly given the challenges and uncertainties I have just outlined.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/279-2-may-2007.html"
"2007-05-01","Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking our speakers for excellent presentations. All well thought out and offering an interesting perspective on some of the key issues facing the petroleum industry.

My OPEC colleague, Mr Al-Zayer, provided an excellent scene setting overview of the short- medium- and long-term prospects for the oil market, highlighting some of the key challenges the industry faces. His address also touched on the topic I will present on today: the role of OPEC spare capacity in providing stability to the market.

In this presentation I will go into far more detail on this topic. Highlighting not only the importance of OPEC spare capacity, and the role this has played in the past and is expected to play in the future, but also emphasizing the real concerns of possible over-expansion of capacity, and in turn the investment risk burden to OPEC Member Countries.

[Slide 2]
The best place for me to start is by providing you with the most recent trends in OPEC capacity and production, as well as an historical perspective on spare capacity. As this slide underlines, OPEC’s spare production capacity has shown signs of tightness on a couple of occasions over the past 15 years or so. Firstly, in the early 1990s, and then most recently in 2004 and in both cases this was due to unexpected high demand and/or unplanned production losses. Since 2004, however, the levels of spare capacity are much improved despite some ongoing geopolitical tensions in countries such as Iraq and Nigeria.

What is also interesting to note are the periods of large levels of spare capacity, particularly in 1999 and 2002. These are attributed mainly to rising non-OPEC supply, chiefly in Russia. Large levels of idle capacity are obviously a concern for producers and I will document worries surrounding this type of phenomenon later in the presentation.

The key take away here is that OPEC production has always risen to meet market needs. There has always been enough supply to meet the required demand. In fact, OPEC oil production and capacity increased during the 2002-2005 period despite unintended capacity losses in some countries. During this period our Member Countries increased production by around 4.5 mb/d.

Total capacity also advanced during the past year, even though OPEC production fell. The overall production fall was due to the fact that towards the end of last year crude oil supplies were well in excess of actual demand, as the high level of crude stocks in OECD countries demonstrated. The imbalance in the supply and demand fundamentals was destabilizing the market, and thus OPEC reduced production.

The result of all this is that, with OPEC’s upstream capacity on course to rise to around 34.8 mb/d by the end of the year, against an expected average output of 30.9 mb/d for the year, our spare capacity should be at levels that are comfortable for the market.

[Slide 3]
OPEC’s policy has, indeed, ensured that the trend of ample production and sufficient spare capacity will continue for years to come, benefiting producers and consumers alike and enhancing stability. OPEC capacity growth is underpinned by over 130 E&P projects, 50 per cent of which are with International Oil Companies (IOCs). Total cumulative capital expenditure is likely to exceed $130 billion. Due to the timing and nature of projects, the largest increases are expected to be concentrated in Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Angola, UAE, Libya and Algeria. These projects are in addition to all energy infrastructure projects, such as pipelines, export terminals and downstream expansion.

[Slide 4]
Moves to maintain a healthy level of spare capacity are emphasized clearly in this slide. OPEC has plans in place that are expected to result in 39.7 mb/d of crude capacity by the end of 2010, representing an increase of about 5 mb/d from end 2006. Similarly, production capacity of NGL and other liquids will be expanded by almost 1.7mb/d to 6 mb/d by 2010.

[Slide 5]
Another important element of OPEC’s capacity expansion is that the crude quality of new projects is overwhelmingly medium and light. In fact, over the next three years the predominant crude quality will be light. This is in contrast to conventional wisdom and underlines that OPEC is developing the right projects to help alleviate some of the downstream problems that were touched on by Mr Al-Zayer. It is not only inadequate past investment that has caused lack of effective global refining capacity in the past few years, but also increasingly stringent product specifications. It is extremely important for the downstream market that we look to tap into more medium and light crudes.

[Slide 6]
To complete the picture, I will now turn to non-OPEC supply. The impact of Engineering & Procurement capital expenditure increases on non-OPEC growth since 2002 has been positive. In fact on average, production has increased at record rates. Increased investment has also resulted in the stabilization of production in many mature fields by slowing the decline rate of many, enabled the development of marginal fields, allowed for more exploration and the application of more technology, and kicked off an expansion of projects under development and fields in production.

The one significant blip was 2005, when the Gulf of Mexico witnessed its most intense storms in 100 years.

Other events, such as the sinking of the world’s largest floating production platform in Brazil in 2001 and the collapse of Russia’s largest oil company in 2004 had very little impact on non-OPEC supply. In the six year period from 2000 non-OPEC oil production growth averaged 800,000 b/d per year, nearly five times higher than the period 1990-99, and one of the highest growth rates in 20 years.

However, the fact that non-OPEC production growth fell behind that of world demand growth for the years 2003-06 – reversing earlier trends of exceeding or matching demand growth – combined with the frequency of accidents and of downward forecast revisions, led the analytical community to under appreciate non-OPEC’s recent performance and to essentially write off its potential.

Going forward, the OPEC Secretariat’s medium term assessment of world liquids production capacity indicates that non-OPEC has significant potential and that it will continue to grow. Non-OPEC growth has the potential to average 1.2 mb/d annually in the 2007-2008 period and more than 750,000 b/d in 2009-2010. Non-OPEC production growth is underpinned by over 300 greenfield and brownfield developments, most of which are in construction or in advanced planning stage.

Regionally, Russia and the Caspian region will lead non-OPEC growth, with the bulk of the increase expected to come from the Caspian. Outside these areas, supply growth is driven primarily by increases in offshore West Africa, offshore Latin America, Gulf of Mexico and non-conventional in North America. The Middle East, OECD Asia and other parts of Asia will show modest gains, while Western Europe is expected to decline driven by a fall in output from the North Sea.

[Slide 7]
In all this talk of supply, however, we need to appreciate the flip side of the coin: demand. Although practically all forecasts point to a significant growth in global demand over the medium and long term, there are also several uncertainties that might well contribute to destabilizing the market. As you can see from the slide in front of you, on the one hand, demand growth could be driven up by an increase in the transport sector, the industrialization of developing countries, and a wish for building inventories. On the other hand, demand growth could be negatively affected by a range of consuming countries’ energy and fiscal policies as highlighted by Mr Al-Zayer, as well as new technologies. These factors raise important questions about the future scale of investment that will be required of producers.

[Slide 8]
What I would also like to highlight is that the market has been well-supplied during the recent period of significant demand growth between 2003 and 2006. Investments made some years ago ensured that the market was well supplied. And during this time OPEC raised its production level to help satisfy the increased demand for oil and ensure adequate inventory levels, while accelerating the expansion of crude oil production capacity to meet future increases in demand and maintain sufficient spare capacity. Despite the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on oil facilities in the US Gulf Coast region, OPEC’s assurances of healthy supply helped prevent this supply interruption from developing into a crisis.

If we look at the future, however, the issue of security of demand, which is intrinsically linked to the issue of security of supply, is of very real concern. Without confidence that there will be demand for OPEC oil, the incentive to undertake investment will also be reduced because of concerns that this will lead to large levels of unused capacity and, in turn, to downward pressures on oil prices.

This would result in huge revenue losses and OPEC Member Countries, as developing countries with strong competing needs for financial resources, would be adversely affected in terms of available resources for education, healthcare and infrastructure.

[Slide 9]
This slide shows the estimated capacity of crude and NGLs until 2010. It also highlights the expected required OPEC crude, based on reference case demand assumptions and non-OPEC supply growth expectations. Please note that we do not expect a significant increase in the demand for OPEC crude until 2009, which means that there will be time to build capacity. Of course, if the demand is lower, then excess capacity will be much larger. Similarly, if non-OPEC supply or demand are higher, then spare capacity will increase but at a slower rate. However, we think the risks are to the down side. This needs to be carefully monitored.

[Slide 10]
OPEC capacity expansion plans therefore give rise to the expectation that significant increases in spare capacity will occur over the medium-term. Indeed, the reference case scenario would involve OPEC spare capacity rising to 6-9 mb/d during this time. Yet as this slide also highlights there are both weak demand and high demand growth scenarios that could impact spare capacity. Again, this needs to be carefully monitored.

[Slide 11]
Allow me now to touch on an issue also highlighted by Mr Al-Zayer. What this means for producing countries in financial terms. As this graph shows, different demand requirements translate into huge ranges of anticipated capital outlay needs. As early as 2010, it is estimated that there will be a gap of $60 billion between the high and the low economic growth case, this gap could increase to $110 billion by 2015 and by 2020 the gap is $170 billion. This demonstrates the key challenge of anticipating, in a timely and effective manner, the appropriate scale of investments needed to maintain and expand upstream capacity and the corresponding downstream infrastructure.

But as a result of these uncertainties affecting security of demand, OPEC Member Countries will be reviewing their future capacity expansion plans. It also begs question: with these investment uncertainties where does the onus of maintaining sufficient spare capacity lie?

[Slide 12]
To conclude, there are challenges and uncertainties, but we believe the overall picture for the industry is positive. During the next few years we expect to see a strong increase in non-OPEC supply and OPEC capacity. OPEC spare capacity is expected to continue to rise in the medium term and the required OPEC crude is likely to drop or remain flat at best until 2009. In order to ensure market stability, however, players in OPEC and non-OPEC countries must collaborate strongly.

This is all the more important given the challenges that the industry is currently facing and the uncertainties driven by factors like the growth of the world economy, consuming country energy policies (substantial downside risk to demand) and technological developments.

From OPEC’s perspective, we will continue to support market stability with regular and steady supplies to consumers, and the maintenance of a adequate level of spare capacity. Yet, in all this, we need to also appreciate security of demand and the importance of this in the determining levels of spare capacity. Spare capacity levels that are too high are a concern for producers, and when too low, they are a concern for consumers. A healthy balance is the best way forward.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/280-1-may-2007.html"
"2007-05-01","It gives me great pleasure to be here today at the Offshore Technology Conference 2007 and to be part of such a distinguished panel of oil industry experts put together by the OPEC Secretariat. On behalf of OPEC, I would like to thank you all for accepting our offer to be part of this panel. All in all, I believe we have all the ingredients for an interesting and insightful session focused on the new realities ahead for the petroleum industry.

So where should I start? Well, before I look at some of the ‘new realities’ this session alludes to, I feel it is appropriate to provide you with some of the consistent and perpetual realities we view when we picture the past, present and future petroleum industry. This also allows me to lay the basic foundation that underpins OPEC’s perspective for the world oil market going forward.

[Slide 2] The first constant concerns resources. We may have had predictions of the end of the oil age for over 100 years, but as I am sure you are all aware resources have continually expanded both geographically and by volume, and we expect this to be the trend for the foreseeable future.

Putting figures to these statements, estimates from the US Geological Survey of ultimately recoverable reserves have practically doubled since the early 1980s, from just 1,700 billion barrels to over 3,300 billion barrels. Almost a 100 per cent increase. This has been driven by innovation, with our industry continually finding new ways to enhance reserves and meet ever rising demand, particularly through technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery from existing fields. For example, ten years ago the limit of development in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico was 3,000 feet. Now it is 8,000 feet. We expect to see new technological developments further expand the world’s ultimately recoverable reserves.

[Slide 3] A further constant for the oil industry has been the growth in energy demand. And there will be no departure from this trend. Our reference case projections to 2030 show global energy demand increasing by around 1.7 per cent annually. It also highlights that fossil fuels will continue to provide more than 90 per cent of the world’s total commercial energy needs, with oil remaining the leading source in the global energy mix, although its share may decrease from 39 per cent to 36.5 per cent.

[Slide 4] Regarding oil, the reference case scenario displays world demand rising at an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent during this period, climbing from 84.1 mb/d in 2006 to 118 mb/d in 2030. Developing countries will increasingly capture a higher share, with consumption doubling from 29 mb/d to 58 mb/d. This is under the assumption that no particular departure in trends for energy policies and technologies takes place. For oil, the main source of future growth will continue to be in the transportation sector. With this in mind, the industry is obviously very sensitive to any technology and policy developments in this sector. These are issues I shall return to later.

[Slide 5] And finally, another constant is that OPEC is continuing to respond to the need for additional oil, underlining its longstanding commitment to market stability, which dates back to the establishment of our Organization more than 45 years ago.

Today, OPEC Member Countries (MCs) are investing heavily in maintaining existing capacity and building new capacity, to ensure that markets are adequately supplied at all times and there is a comfortable level of spare capacity.

Going forward, OPEC crude capacity expansion plans already in place are expected to result in almost 40 mb/d of crude capacity by the end of 2010, underpinned by more than 140 projects totaling more than $120 billion. In addition, many MCs are investing in the downstream, both inside and outside of their borders. OPEC is doing its share and is committed to ensuring order and stability in the international oil market, with secure supply, reasonable prices and fair returns to investors. The goal is a market where the fundamentals of supply and demand are balanced.

[Slide 6] Talk of supply and demand fundamentals, leads me nicely onto the ‘new realities’ and the first focuses on where supply will come from. According to our projections, non-OPEC crude oil supply – excluding non-conventionals – is expected to rise over the coming years and reach a plateau of 48 mb/d, before beginning a gradual decline from around 2020. This plateau is initially maintained as increases from Latin America, mainly Brazil, as well as Russia and the Caspian compensate for decreases elsewhere. The outlook is a little more conservative that previous assessments due to the inclusion of Angola in the OPEC grouping.

Additionally, OPEC’s most recent assessment of the market out to 2030 introduces a specific section on non-conventional oil supply and biofuels from non-OPEC countries In total, more than 10 mb/d of non-conventional oil supply plus biofuels will come from non-OPEC by 2030, 8 mb/d more than in 2005. The most significant growth is expected to come from Canadian oil sands, with some increases elsewhere, primarily in China. From OPEC’s perspective, the amount of crude oil that it is expected to supply increases markedly post-2010, rising to 38 mb/d by 2020 and 49 mb/d by 2030. Thus, going forward, the new reality is that OPEC MCs will be increasingly called upon to supply the incremental barrel.

[Slide 7] This anticipated reference scenario, however, is fraught with uncertainties. This is particularly relevant to those countries slated to step up the plate and meet the expected future demand growth. For example, doubts over future oil demand translate into large uncertainties over the amount OPEC MCs will eventually need to supply, signifying a heavy burden of risk. Out to 2020, scenarios developed by the OPEC Secretariat highlight that the amount of oil required from OPEC could range by close to 9 mb/d.

In monetary terms, the corresponding range for MCs is somewhere between $230 billion and $500 billion, representing a huge uncertainty for MCs upstream investment requirements, all with competing needs in such areas as health, education and infrastructure. In addition, a large amount of idle capacity would put much downward pressure on prices and be detrimental to vital export revenues.

[Slide 8] In fact, the risks have heightened recently. For example, recent policy initiatives that discriminate against oil, involving subsidies for competing fuels and higher tax rates, may see even lower demand for oil products in general, and for OPEC oil in particular. In the EU, Member States have agreed to adopt a binding 2020 target to increase renewable fuel use by 20 per cent. There are also ambiguities as to how each Member State will meet this goal. And the US is promoting the use of ethanol with subsidies and has set out ambitious targets for increasing the use of alternative fuels. The most recent proposal in the US – the Alternative Fuels Standard Programme – sees alternative transport fuel hitting almost 2.3 mb/d by 2017. This is approximately 1.5 mb/d more than what has been laid out in OPEC’s reference case over the same period.

The new reality in this situation leads us to the question: will producing countries need to revisit their investment plans, in the face of policies that lean towards a movement away from oil? Investments in capacity that will just lie idle do not make sense. While OPEC has offered in the past, and will continue to offer in the future, adequate levels of spare capacity for the benefit of the world at large, it cannot be expected to invest in what to all intents and purposes is a back-up security policy in case alternative fuel policy initiatives fail to materialize. It is important that there is more transparency in energy sector policy-making among consumer countries, so that better assessments can be made to undertake the appropriate capacity expansions and prevent the waste of precious financial resources.

[Slide 9] These uncertainties also impact downstream investment. OPEC analysis reveals that tightness in the refining sector, especially in light, clean products for transportation, has increased pressure on oil prices generally. The extent to which refining tightness will ease will depend on the evolution of what is currently a neck-and-neck race between refinery capacity growth and demand growth.

OPEC’s assessment of existing refinery projects indicates that investments, including new units and maintenance and replacement, total $455 billion, with the largest number of capacity additions and investment taking place in the Middle East. As with the upstream, however, timely investment needs to take into account policy initiatives. The new reality is that uncertainties related to the levels of future products demand and non-refined supplies are currently resulting in additional risks, for a sector traditionally characterized by low margins and high volatility.

[Slide 10] Alongside the investment issues I have highlighted, it must also be appreciated that we are presently in a period when costs are significantly inflated, in part, as a result of the low oil price environment ten years or so ago. This led to the implementation of downsizing and cost-cutting strategies in particular in the services sector. According to CERA, upstream costs have increased by 53 percent over the last two years. It leads me to the question: is this cost behaviour structural or cyclical? Whatever the answer, it is a huge challenge facing the industry and an issue that needs to be continually monitored.

The industry’s expansion is also being significantly constrained in the area of human resources. A shortage of skilled labour for drilling, engineering, procurement, construction and other services and a downturn in the number of students in energy fields are serious reasons for concern.

[Slide 11] The reality is that as an industry today it often appears that we have an image problem and we are becoming less attractive as a career choice. One of the reasons is that the industry is unfortunately often painted as one in its twilight years or the cause of many of the worlds’ ills. In fact, it is often difficult to fathom just how quickly viewpoints on our industry can change, as this slide underlines. To counteract these often less than positive views, the industry needs to make concerted efforts to help facilitate education and training in energy disciplines. We need to focus on how we can attract, develop and inspire the talented young people who will lead our industry into the future. It is this ‘next generation’ that will be at the fulcrum of our industry’s future technological and economic development.

[Slide 12] My final ‘new reality’, well it is something that has always been a reality, is the protection of the environment, both locally and globally. We can all see that this is becoming an increasingly global challenge, but let me stress that the oil industry has a long history of successfully improving its environmental credentials, for both the production and the use of the world’s leading energy source. For example, in the global environment arena our MCs have invested billions of dollars over the past decades in flared gas recovery projects. This represents a significant contribution to the reduction – by more than half since the early 1970s – of the amount of gas that has been flared per barrel of oil produced.

[Slide 13] What needs to be recognized is that our industry is vital to the future of all countries of this world. So, the creation and nurturing of technology that can be made compatible with the objective of limiting or reducing the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is a must. We need to look at technological options that allow the continued use of fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained world.

One promising option is carbon capture and storage (CCS), applied to large stationary sources of CO2 emissions, such as power stations and industrial sites, which together account for over half the energy-related CO2 emissions. CCS can also be used in conjunction with CO2-enhanced oil recovery. Last year, OPEC held a workshop with the EU in Riyadh on CCS, a demonstration of its commitment to this technology. It is also joining the IEA GHG R&D Programme.

In the area of CCS and similar technologies, industrialised countries, having the financial and technological capabilities, should take the lead, by promoting large-scale demonstration projects. This includes through the possible use and probable redesign of the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

[Slide 14] What all these realities point to is the fact we live in an energy interdependent world. It is a two-way street. The role of oil is equally important to the economic growth and prosperity of consuming-importing countries as well as to the development and social progress of producing-exporting countries. The concern of consuming countries for the secure flow of oil at reasonable price is matched by the concern of producers for predictable demand, non-discrimination against their products, access to markets, reasonable and stable prices for their exhaustible resources and adequate revenues for their socio-economic development.

It means that we need to develop and explore, existing and new avenues of cooperation, in the context of an increasingly interdependent world. Efforts at expanding dialogues are something our Organization has, and continues to devote much energy to. The most recent result of this was the establishment of energy dialogues between OPEC and a number of other industry stakeholders: the EU, China, Russia, a number of other non-OPEC producers and the IEA. This year these have already and will be broadened. In late March, there was a meeting with the Asian refinery community in Bangkok, and early talks will be held with Japanese officials from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Tokyo.

Ladies & gentlemen,

[Slide 15] In all this talk of realities, perhaps the one word that springs to mind is balance: between the interests of producers and consumers; between security of supply and security of demand; between technologies – old and new; between NOCs and IOCs; between the various energy types; in the promotion of new policies; and perhaps most importantly between the three pillars of sustainable development. The focus is on ensuring healthy economic growth, rapid social progress and environmental protection in a mutually-supportive manner. In this regard, we also cannot forget that 1.1 billion people are currently living on less than $1 a day, almost two billion have no electricity and many people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating in unsustainable ways. The new realities for our industry, offers both challenges and opportunities. In the end, if challenges are to be met and opportunities seized, more cooperation is required to develop a more detailed understanding of the long-term development of the industry. OPEC is ready, willing and able to play its part.

"2007-05-01","Ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome to this OPEC-organized session at the Offshore Technology Conference 2007, titled: ‘The Petroleum Industry: New Realities Ahead’. The Conference is one of the preeminent in our industry, covering the latest and most important topics, technologies and innovations, and at OPEC we are delighted to be directly involved in putting together this session.

Today’s agenda was constructed to focus on the key challenges, the major uncertainties and the foremost opportunities we envisage in the petroleum industry going forward. And to ask the question: what are the new realities ahead? It will be interesting to see how each panellist views the market.

Turning to the panelists themselves, I am sure you will agree that we have some highly thought of energy industry experts here and I would like to thank each and every one of you for accepting our invitation. I look forward to an extremely productive and stimulating session.

So, what will be the main topics discussed? To set the scene, there will be an overview of the short- medium- and long-term prospects of the oil market and highlighting some of the challenges facing the petroleum industry. This will also outline the importance of maintaining market stability with a market well balanced between supply and demand.

Following this there will be more focused presentations on some of the most fundamental industry questions and concerns. This includes:

There is certainly plenty there to prompt much debate and I hope that everyone here will have an opportunity to express their thoughts and put questions to our panelists during the wrap up. With this in mind, allow me to leave you with a few simple questions that might be worth considering during the session.

Firstly, how do you view the market today? Secondly, what do you see as the challenges and uncertainties, as well as the opportunities, going forward? Thirdly, how do we continually improve the environmental credentials of oil? And finally, how can we further advance the producer-consumer dialogue?

Without further ado, I shall now introduce our keynote speaker, Mr Fuad Al-Zayer, head of OPEC’s Data Services Division, who will provide a petroleum market overview, Mr Al-Zayer, the floor is yours.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/282-1-may-2007.html"
"2007-04-27","Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me first begin by thanking the organizers for their kind invitation to deliver this keynote address on “The future of oil and gas and the challenges and opportunities for NOCs”. On a personal level, the theme of this conference is especially dear to me since I worked for an NOC for more than 20 years.

If I were speaking to you four decades ago, our attention would, most likely, be focused on multinational oil companies, notably the so-called “Seven Sisters”. However, the early 70s witnessed the birth of a stronger, high performance NOCs we know today. The fact that this occurred about a decade after the birth of OPEC is no coincidence. During the 60s, OPEC spent a lot of time examining the role of the then weak NOCs, to help them coordinate their activities in the international oil market and undertake appropriate programmes of action. A Landmark declaration statement of petroleum policies in Member Countries encapsulated OPEC concern in 1968, key clauses include that “Member Countries should be in a position to undertake themselves directly the exploitation of their hydrocarbon resources”. During the 70s, the situation changed. Many producing countries nationalized their oil industry, thus reaffirming sovereignty over their natural resources. By 2005, NOCs controlled 77 per cent of global proven oil reserves. Today, 14 of the top 20 oil producers are NOCs or newly privatized NOCs. This includes Saudi Aramco, National Iranian Oil Company, INOC of Iraq, PDVSA, Sonatrach and NNPC from OPEC Member Countries.

I wanted to start with this brief background in order to appreciate the importance of advanced, dynamic NOCs to oil-producing developing countries. In turn, this will help us pursue our discussions today in a more meaningful and rounded manner.

So, what is the outlook of the oil and gas industry today? Overall, we can say that the future of oil and gas is very bright.

On the demand side, all forecasts point to a rise in demand for both oil and gas. Oil demand is expected to rise by an average of 1.4 p% per year, and to make up around 36.5% of the world energy mix by 2030 or about 120 mbpd, according to the OPEC reference scenario. The share of gas, on the other hand, is expected to climb to over 27% cent by 2030, up from over 23 per cent at the moment. Industrialized countries will continue to consume most of the energy, while the bulk of demand growth is expected to come from the Asian developing countries, in particular from the booming economies and populations of China and India, accounting for about 86% of the global demand. As you can see, oil has long been the leading source in the global energy mix, and this is expected to remain the case for the foreseeable future. As a result, NOCs will continue to play a significant role to deliver the additional barrel.

Please allow me to underline that OPEC understands the importance of energy for the social and economic development of the world, in particular for developing countries. We know that societies cannot develop without energy: roads and bridges cannot be built, large-scale agricultural projects cannot be implemented, and the communications infrastructure that is so crucial in enabling citizens to participate and compete, in the global economy cannot be laid without energy. As an organization constituted by developing countries lucky enough to have been endowed with natural resources, we support poorer nations in their quest for realizing their economic growth objectives. Since it was founded in 1976, the OPEC Fund for International Development has extended a total of over US$8.5 billion in development assistance to non-OPEC developing nations.

As for the supply side, we see that OPEC’s role as a world oil supplier is forecasted to rise during the first quarter of the twenty-first century. We fully expect that the petroleum industry will be able to meet these increases in demand. What is notable is the projected shift in the origin of the supply: in the short term, growth of supply is likely to come from non-OPEC countries, but OPEC will be responsible for an increasing share of global oil supplies in the long term. NOCs of OPEC Member Countries are presently undertaking numerous capacity expansion plans that will result in almost 40 mbpd of crude capacity by 2010, an increase of 5 mbpd, underpinned by more than 100 projects totalling US$100 billion.

Moving Downstream, our analysis reveals that tightness in the refinery sector has been the result of tightness across all basic functions of the refineries. OPEC NOCs are also taking on the burden of investing downstream both in their own countries and in consuming countries. OPEC NOCs alone are planning to expand refinery capacities by 5 mbpd.

These two aspects—growth of supply from OPEC Member Countries and increased demand—clearly point to a strengthened role for NOCs in the global oil industry. NOCs will continue to be called upon to provide reliable sources of energy to the world, as they have been throughout the industry’s history. While the industry has been discussing how risky it is for NOCs to control reserves, perhaps it is worth recalling that NOCs have always met demand for every single barrel of oil. Nonetheless, we believe that NOCs are part of a larger whole and will not be able to meet the challenges without collaborating closely with IOCs and other key players. Together, oil companies—whether national or international—are the central driving force in the oil industry, right across the supply chain, from exploration and production, through processing and transportation, all the way to marketing, sale and distribution. Strong partnerships between the public and private sector are to be encouraged, especially given the challenges that the oil industry is facing.

So, what are these key challenges facing the Oil & Gas Industry in general and NOCs in specific? The first has to do with technology. Oil companies must continually seek to develop new technologies, for example to enhance recovery from mature oil fields and deep offshore locations. Technological developments have already brought important changes in the industry in the past. For example, with regards to deepwater exploration, 10 years ago the limit of development in the Gulf of Mexico was about 3,000 feet. Today it is 8,000 feet. Technological advances also promise to blur the distinctions between conventional and non-conventional oils by making it easier to extract and refine tar sands. The oil industry has a history of innovation and we are confident that this will continue.

Another challenge facing the industry is that of the rising costs of projects: drilling costs alone have increased by 5% since 2003, with steel prices rising by 40% since 2004.

A related challenge that contributes to high rise projects is that of labour shortage. This has contributed to increasing wages by about 15% in 2005 alone. Over the past 18 months, the situation has worsened mainly due to the early retirement of professionals. While the average age of employees in the oil and gas sector is around 47 years, the average retirement age is just 55. Clearly, the industry as a whole must become more proactive in recruiting and training new engineers, geologists, technicians and managers. Given their close relationship with their respective governments, NOCs can work with governments to facilitate the educational and professional mobility of citizens in this sector. OPEC Member Countries and NOCs are taking action to reduce this shortage by developing programs that facilitate the development of engineering expertise and build a trained workforce capable of contributing to the local economy. This is an area that can benefit a lot from NOC-IOC and NOC-NOC cooperation.

The environment debate poses another challenge, one that the industry takes very seriously. NOCs have been active in combating local pollution—for example through initiatives that prevent oil spills and reduce gas flaring—as well as tackling the larger issue of global warming. OPEC supports the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which hold great promise for making the use of fossil fuels more environmentally friendly. OPEC is committed to reconcile the forecasted rise in hydrocarbon use with a cleaner, safer global environment. The industry has a long history of improving the environmental credentials of oil, in both production and use. This will remain a priority in the future for our NOCs. This also can benefit great deal from NOC-IOC cooperation.

Another challenge facing NOCs relates to uncertainties of demand. Until recently, the matter of energy security has been viewed primarily from the perspective of the need to secure constant and abundant supplies of affordable energy for consumers. The oil industry is beginning to understand that energy security requires a much more comprehensive approach, one that also acknowledges producing nations’ need for security of demand.

Consuming countries are sending mixed signals on future demand. On the one hand, there is a call for security of supply based on expectations that the world economy will continue to grow and that greater amounts of oil will be needed. At the same time, many countries are repeatedly taking measures to move away from fossil fuels. For example, the US Government has launched its “Twenty in Ten” initiative, which aims at reducing gasoline consumption in the United States by 20% over the next decade. While these are decisions that sovereign nations are fully entitled to make, it is worth reminding that OPEC Member Countries have, to date, spent large sums of money to provide ample supply for now and for the future. But, in the light of these uncertainties and out of concern that upstream investments might decrease, OPEC Member Countries might have to review their future capacity expansion plans. After all, it would make no sense for them to channel funds into facilities that might remain idle, especially in developing countries where these funds compete with the provision of basic services to citizens. Long term demand Roadmap is crucial to meeting producers own social & economic interests.

We believe that the key to overcoming the challenges listed above and minimizing uncertainties is through increased transparency, dialogue, partnership and cooperation. Dialogue should be widened and deepened to cover more issues of mutual concern. OPEC is presently engaged in formal Energy Dialogues with the International Energy Agency (IEA), the European Union (EU), China and Russia. We are also strong advocates of the role of the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI).

Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

Please allow me to conclude that, we believe that successful collaboration between national and international oil companies, can play an important role in helping the industry meet the many and varied challenges that lie before it, especially when the consensus view is that world oil demand will continue to rise for many years to come.

The industry will see the emergence of stronger highly competence NOCs that will focuses both on its social obligations to its own governments & citizens; as well as being competence, profitable, and huh performance NOCs, that will continue to be reliable suppliers of energy to the world.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/283-27-april-2007.html"
"2007-04-05","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let me start by thanking the organisers for the invitation to present on behalf of OPEC’s Secretary General, HE Abdalla Salem El-Badri, to such a distinguished gathering and on such important topics. Given the history and nature of our industry, the use of the words ‘challenges’ and ‘cooperation’ for today’s session could not be more apt.

The oil industry has successfully dealt with many challenges in the past; through technology development, extended reach, innovative ways of doing business and by continuously creating and developing new opportunities. Today, in a more global and interconnected world the challenges continue, some new, others the result of past actions and behaviours, but all necessitating innovative thinking, collaboration, timely adaptation and swift action.

[Slide 2] To the fore and perhaps the overriding challenge is that related to sustainable development. The focus is on ensuring healthy economic growth, rapid social progress and environmental protection in a mutually-supportive manner. Like in the past, energy will be essential in this respect.

Our reference case projections to 2030 show global energy demand increasing by around 1.7 per cent annually. It also highlights that fossil fuels will continue to provide more than 90 per cent of the world’s total commercial energy needs, with oil remaining the leading source in the global energy mix, although its share may decrease from 39 per cent to 36 per cent.

[Slide 3] Regarding oil, the reference case scenario displays world demand rising at an average annual rate of 1.4 per cent during this period, climbing from 84.6 mb/d in 2006 to 118 mb/d in 2030. Developing countries account for most of this rise, with consumption doubling from 29 mb/d to 58 mb/d. More than two-thirds of this growth will be in Asian developing countries. For oil, the main source of future increases will be in the transportation sector. Thus, the industry is very sensitive to any technology, policy and economic developments in this sector.

[Slide 4] To complete the future demand outlook, what I need to underline are the uncertainties in all this. Doubts over how future oil demand plays out translate into large uncertainties over the amount that OPEC Member Countries (MCs) will eventually need to supply, signifying a heavy burden of risk. For example, to 2020, scenarios developed by the OPEC Secretariat highlight that the amount of oil required from OPEC could range by close to 9 mb/d. And this is where we come to the security of demand challenge; for the oil industry as a whole and for OPEC MCs specifically.

In monetary terms, the corresponding range for MCs is somewhere between $230 billion and $500 billion, representing a huge uncertainty for MCs upstream investment requirements, all with competing needs in such areas as health, education and infrastructure. In addition, a large amount of idle capacity would put much downward pressure on prices and be detrimental to vital export revenues.

[Slide 5] In fact, the risks have heightened recently. For example, recent policy initiatives that discriminate against oil, involving subsidies for competing fuels and higher tax rates, may see even lower demand for oil products in general, and for OPEC oil in particular. In the EU, Member States have agreed to adopt a binding 2020 target to increase renewable fuel use by 20 per cent. And the US is promoting the use of ethanol with subsidies and has set out ambitious targets for increasing the use of alternative fuels. The most recent proposal in the US – the Alternative Fuels Standard Programme – sees alternative transport fuel hitting almost 2.3 mb/d by 2017. This is approximately 1.5 mb/d more than what has been laid out in OPEC’s reference case over the same period.

It begs the question: will producing countries need to revisit their investment plans, in the face of policies that lean towards a movement away from oil? Investments in capacity that will just lie idle do not make sense. While OPEC has offered in the past, and will continue to offer in the future, adequate levels of spare capacity for the benefit of the world at large, it cannot be expected to invest in what to all intents and purposes is a back-up security policy in case alternative fuel policy initiatives fail to materialise.

[Slide 6] With regards to policies, it is also worth mentioning the continuing upward trend in the taxation of oil products. This has evolved over the past three decades despite the up and down nature of crude price behaviour. This throws up a challenge to the industry as a whole as most of the end-consumer price ends up in the budget of the consuming country government. It means that only a relatively small fraction is left to recover costs and provide returns to producers and those investing in the industry.

[Slide 7] The uncertainties I have just described also impact the downstream. Our analysis reveals tightness in the refining sector in the form of inadequate refining capacity which has been putting much pressure on oil prices generally. The extent to which refining tightness will ease will depend on the evolution of what is currently a neck-and-neck race between refinery capacity growth and demand growth.

OPEC’s assessment of existing refinery projects indicates that investments, including new units and maintenance and replacement, total $455 billion, with the largest number of capacity additions and investment taking place in the Middle East. As with the upstream, however, timely investment needs to take into account policy initiatives. Uncertainties related to the levels of future products demand and non-refined supplies are currently resulting in additional risks, for a sector traditionally characterised by low margins and high volatility.

[Slide 8] Alongside the investment issues I have highlighted, it must also be appreciated that we are presently in a period when costs are significantly inflated, in part, as a result of the low oil price environment ten years or so ago. This led to the implementation of downsizing and cost-cutting strategies in particular in the services sector. According to CERA, upstream costs have increased by 53 percent over the last two years. It leads me to the question: is this cost behaviour structural or cyclical? Whatever the answer, it is a huge challenge facing the industry and an issue that needs to be continually monitored.

The industry’s expansion is also being significantly constrained in the area of human resources. A shortage of skilled labour for drilling, engineering, procurement, construction and other services and a downturn in the number of students in energy fields are serious reasons for concern.

[Slide 9] As an industry today it often appears that we have an image problem and we are becoming less attractive as a career choice. One of the reasons is that the industry is unfortunately often painted as one in its twilight years or the cause of many of the worlds’ ills. To counteract these views, the industry needs to make concerted efforts to help facilitate education and training in energy disciplines. We need to make the industry attractive to prospective graduates – this includes making it easier for students to enrol in universities across national borders.

[Slide 10] Let me stress at this juncture that despite the many uncertainties surrounding the future demand for its oil, in spite of the extremely high costs and the shortage of skilled labour, OPEC MCs are investing heavily in maintaining existing capacity and building new capacity, to ensure that markets are adequately supplied at all times and there is a comfortable level of spare capacity.

Going forward, OPEC crude capacity expansion plans already in place are expected to result in almost 40 mb/d of crude capacity by the end of 2010, underpinned by more than 140 projects totalling more than $120 billion. In addition, many MCs are investing in the downstream, both inside and outside of their borders, thus contributing to alleviating the current downstream tightness. OPEC is doing its share and is committed to ensuring order and stability in the international oil market, with secure supply, reasonable prices and fair returns to investors.

[Slide 11] What all this points to is the fact that the energy security challenge is one that requires a shift from talk of one-way dependence to interdependence. It is a two-way street. For example, while net oil imports in OECD countries is around 60 per cent of their total demand, oil exports in OPEC MCs account for no less than 77 per cent of total exports.

The role of oil is equally important to the economic growth and prosperity of consuming-importing countries as well as to the development and social progress of producing-exporting countries. The concern of consuming countries for the secure flow of oil at reasonable price is matched by the concern of producers for predictable demand, non-discrimination against their products, access to markets, reasonable and stable prices for their exhaustible resources and adequate revenues for their socio-economic development.

[Slide 12] I would like now to turn to another extremely important challenge for the future of the oil industry: the protection of the environment, both locally and globally. Up front, let me stress that the oil industry has a long history of successfully improving its environmental credentials, for both the production and the use of the world’s leading energy source. For example, as this slide shows, tailpipe emissions of non-CO2 substances have been enormously reduced over the past three decades.

In the global environment arena our MCs have invested billions of dollars over the past decades in flared gas recovery projects. This represents a significant contribution to the reduction – by more than half since the early 1970s – of the amount of gas that has been flared per barrel of oil produced.

[Slide 13] Globally, it is extremely important to underscore that an increase of fossil fuels use, as painted by all scenarios, can be made compatible with the objective of limiting or reducing the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We need to look at technological options that allow the continued use of fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained world.

One promising option is carbon capture and storage (CCS), applied to large stationary sources of CO2 emissions, such as power stations and industrial sites, which together account for over half the energy-related CO2 emissions. CCS can also be used in conjunction with CO2-enhanced oil recovery. Last year, OPEC held a workshop with the EU in Riyadh on CCS, a demonstration of its commitment to this technology. It is also joining the IEA GHG R&D Programme.

In the area of CCS and similar technologies, industrialised countries, having the financial and technological capabilities, should take the lead, by promoting large-scale demonstration projects. This includes through the possible use and probable redesign of the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

[Slide 14] The challenges described all point to the need to develop and explore, existing and new avenues of cooperation, in the context of an increasingly interdependent world. Efforts at expanding dialogues are something our Organization has, and continues to devote much energy to. The most recent result of this was the establishment of energy dialogues between OPEC and a number of other industry stakeholders: the EU, China, Russia, a number of other non-OPEC producers and the IEA.

This year will also witness OPEC broadening its talks. In late March, there was a meeting with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok, and early talks will be held with Japanese officials from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in Tokyo.

I would also like to highlight the role of the International Energy Forum (IEF) in promoting the producer-consumer dialogue. Its Secretariat in Riyadh is also the home of the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI) and OPEC is extremely proud to have played a significant part in the development of JODI. The initiative has quickly evolved into an internationally-respected initiative focused on advancing the transparency, quality, timeliness and flows of energy market data.

[Slide 15] Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Allow me to conclude by bringing you back to the issue I mentioned at the beginning of my speech: sustainable development. The goal in every decision we make needs to take into account its three pillars: economic growth, social development and environmental protection. With all OPEC Member Countries, developing ones, the issue of sustainable development is one close to the Organization’s heart. In fact, His Excellency Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah, the Second Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Energy and Industry for Qatar, holds the Chair at the present 15th session of the influential United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.

What needs to be recognised is that sustainable development means different things to different people. In this world, it is abundantly clear that many social and economic disparities exist. Today, 1.1 billion people are currently living on less than $1 a day, almost two billion have no electricity and many people rely on traditional biomass for cooking and heating in unsustainable ways. For them, energy is not just about the pumps being full, the public transport infrastructure ticking over, or the DVD player being to hand. It is about having the basic energy services to help eradicate poverty, support health care and education, provide the rudimentary conditions for economic development and enhance living standards. I am proud here to mention our sister organisation, the OPEC Fund for International Development, which is contributing its share to poverty alleviation, through developmental actions in 119 countries.

So just as oil played and continues to play a key role in fuelling the development of industrialised countries, so it will also help fuel the growth of today’s developing nations. It is thus essential that we continue to meet the challenges our industry faces.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/284-5-april-2007.html"
"2006-12-17","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the Regional Clean Sea Organisation for inviting me to address this prestigious Conference and its distinguished audience. Special thanks go to Dr Khamis Bu-Amim, who has kindly agreed to revise the programme, so as to ensure OPEC’s participation.

In introducing the theme of the conference, Recso refers to “finding solutions to energy and environmental challenges”. This is central to OPEC’s thinking too.

We have always looked upon the exploitation of our exhaustible hydrocarbon resources as providing a stepping stone to socioeconomic development.

We have, at the same time, taken a keen and active interest in the issue of sustainable development, as epitomised by the Plan of Implementation resulting from the World Summit on Sustainable Development, held in Johannesburg in 2002. In particular, we consider that poverty eradication — as the first UN Millennium Development Goal — is an overriding priority. We maintain that sustainable development should be approached in a balanced manner through its three mutually supportive pillars; these are economic development, social progress and the protection of the environment. And we believe in the need for developing countries to have improved access to modern energy services that are reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sound.

We often hear about the impact of energy use on the environment, but far too little is said about the opposite phenomenon. This concerns the positive effects of a sound energy system on people’s day-to-day lives, especially in the poorer nations. For example, the provision of modern energy services means less smoke-filled dwellings, less carrying of heavy firewood, less deforestation, more efficient cooking, easier access to doctors, greater mobility for jobs, and so on.

Clearly, energy and environmental challenges occupy much common ground, and, if managed carefully, they will benefit from coordinated solutions!

[Slide 2] In my presentation today, I shall first see how the world energy scene may evolve in the future, with increasing reliance on OPEC oil and gas , especially from the Middle East. This may present greater challenges than ever before for the region — both in meeting the steadily rising demand and in doing this in a manner that is in full harmony with the environment. I shall then identify some of the environmental challenges before making some conclusions on these important issues.

[Slide 3] As we look into the future, demand for energy is clearly set to continue growing. Fossil fuels will continue to provide more than 90 per cent of the world’s total commercial energy needs, accounting for 95 per cent of the growth in demand over the next 20 years, and will provide essential support for the forecast sustained pattern of healthy global economic growth. Oil has been in the leading position in supplying the world’s growing energy needs for the past four decades, and there is a clear expectation that this will continue, accounting for close to 40 per cent of energy demand over the next two decades. Gas is expected to grow at fast rates, while coal will maintain its importance in the energy mix. The total contribution of hydro, nuclear and new renewables will flatten out: indeed, despite the extremely high growth rates for some new renewables, the rather low initial base makes the growth in absolute terms rather limited.

[Slide 4] Turning specifically to oil demand, OPEC’s reference case scenario puts average annual oil demand growth at 1.6 per cent for the period up to 2025, reaching 113 million barrels a day. For gas, the figures are 2.6 per cent and 79 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. It is important to stress that the global resource base is sufficient to deal with such large rises in demand for decades to come.

There will be a growing call on the vast quantity of oil and gas reserves in OPEC and, notably, the Middle East. According to our projections, non-OPEC crude oil supply is expected to reach a plateau of around 58–60 mb/d after 2015, after continuing to rise up to that time. Then OPEC will be relied upon increasingly to supply the incremental barrel.

[Slide 5] In turn, this will help iron out the discrepancy between OPEC holding 78 per cent of the world’s proven crude oil reserves and yet accounting for only 42 per cent of its production.

[Slide 6] However, the situation is not as straightforward as this. Investment strategies can be adversely affected by uncertainties over such key factors as world economic growth levels, advances in technology and policy measures in consuming countries. Over the next 15 years, for example, our scenarios show that the amount of oil required from OPEC could range by close to 10 mb/d. Even over the medium term to 2010, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment, and this increases to as much as $240 bn by 2020. Thus there is a heavy burden of risk for producer countries, with the huge amounts of capital that must be committed up front and the long lead times that characterise our industry. This is why OPEC calls repeatedly for more transparency in energy sector policy-making among consumer countries. For oil-producing developing countries, security of demand is as important as security of supply.

Let us now look more closely at the implications of all this for the Middle East.

[Slide 7] Our projections show that exports of crude oil and oil products will continue to increase from the Middle East. Oil exports are expected to rise from around 20 mb/d in 2005 to almost 24 mb/d by 2015 — that is, by around 20 per cent in just a decade. The major destination for these exports will be Asia, which will account for more than 75 per cent of them.

[Slide 8] Consequently, this rising level of oil exports, in combination with growing volumes of other traded goods, will result in a substantial increase in tanker traffic in the Gulf region and hence constitute an enhanced challenge for the environment in the area. The sea lanes in this region are already among the busiest in the world, and it is estimated that close to one-third of global oil tankers pass through them.

The waterways are also relatively shallow and highly vulnerable to pollution, with the accompanying severe public health risks. Unregulated dumping of waste materials, including oil sludge and waste oil, remains a common problem, and even the practice of reballasting at sea comes with known environmental impacts.

It is well known that the countries of the region have been exceptionally proactive in rising to these challenges. This is well reflected in the activities of our hosts, Recso. Most of these countries have ratified the ‘MARPOL’ International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. Other important regional institutions and agreements do exist, such as the Regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment.

[Slide 9] Turning now to local environmental concerns arising from oil product use, it is important to note that the global oil industry has a long history of successfully improving the environmental credentials of oil, both in production and use . As can be seen from the chart on the right, emissions from cars have been dramatically reduced over the last 30 years. Carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions have declined by an order of magnitude. These improvements are expected to continue in the future.

Regarding domestic fuel use in this region, the chart on the left shows clearly that the Gulf countries have made significant recent progress towards introducing tighter product quality specifications, especially for gasoline and automotive diesel. The sulphur content, for example, in products consumed both on land and in tankers, is set to decline dramatically, thus improving air quality substantially.

[Slide 10] However, to enable this, substantial investment would be required in the region’s refining sector, and our own calculations indicate that we are looking at a sum in excess of US $30 billion within the next ten years or so.

In the broader context of the downstream, some $310 billion of investment will be necessary across the globe in additional capacity during this period.

Nevertheless, it is reassuring to know that, in the Middle East, investment is on the way, and there are many projects that will expand the existing refining capacity for both crude distillation and upgrading processes.

Let us now look at another important subject, gas flaring.

[Slide 11] OPEC’s Member Countries have invested billions of dollars over the past decades in flared gas recovery projects. This has represented a significant contribution to the reduction, by more than half since the early 1970s, of the amount of gas that has been flared from a produced barrel of oil.

In OPEC, much of the reduction has been achieved by reinjecting associated gas into oil reservoirs to improve recovery or through monetizing associated gas through liquefaction, such as in Nigeria. There are plans to continue to devote resources to further reduce flaring in the future.

OPEC is interested in furthering partnership opportunities, such as that offered by the World Bank and Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), where we are active participants.

[Slide 12] Before concluding, Mr Chairman, ladies and gentleman, I should like to tackle another important question. As I said earlier, the world will continue to increase its use of fossil fuels for years to come. Is this increased use compatible with the third pillar of sustainable development — environmental protection? In OPEC, we believe so.

One promising means is carbon capture and storage (CCS), where carbon dioxide is captured from large stationary sources , such as power stations and industrial sites, which account for over half the energy-related CO2 emissions, and is then injected into deep geological formations, where it is stored. The technology already exists, and commercial projects are already underway. What is required now is action to raise awareness of this. Indeed, CCS can also be used in conjunction with carbon dioxide-enhanced oil recovery, which offers a ‘win-win’ opportunity by not only storing CO2, but also increasing oil reserves in mature fields. Moreover, we also believe that, in accordance with the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” and respective capabilities, the developed countries should take the lead in the area of providing cleaner oil and gas technologies by promoting large-scale demonstration projects, including the use of the clean development mechanism (CDM).

OPEC has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to CCS, through, for example: its involvement in the International Energy Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Research and Development Programme; the roundtable it held on CCS jointly with the EU in Riyadh in September; and, shortly before that in the same city, its active participation in the First International Conference of the CDM.

In conclusion, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

[Slide 13] It is clear from everything I have said so far that OPEC in general, and the Middle East in particular, will grow in importance in meeting the world’s energy needs. This has important implications for the environment, in terms of air quality and broader-based concerns about climate change.

Notwithstanding the progress made so far, many more energy and environmental challenges lie ahead, both within this region and in the world at large. But, with the challenges come the opportunities for enterprising, far-sighted visionaries to ensure that the world receives the energy it needs in a cleaner, safer and more harmonious environment.

The activities of the Regional Clean Sea Organisation have clearly indicated the direction in which all of us should go.

OPEC too is committed to environmental protection, as reflected in its recently launched Long-Term Strategy.

It is necessary to deal with the issue holistically, in the context of the three mutually supportive pillars of sustainable development — economic development, social development and environmental protection.

Finally, let me remind you that the 15th Session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD15) will be held in New York on 30 April – 11 May next year. Significantly, the CSD15 Bureau is chaired by His Excellency Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah, Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy and Industry of the State of Qatar. His chairmanship provides an excellent opportunity to address these key concerns.

[Slide 14] Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/285-17-december-2006.html"
"2006-11-25","Your Excellency Mr. Ali Naimi,
Ambassador Walther,
Excellencies,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

First of all, I would like to thank the International Energy Forum and its Secretary General, Ambassador Arne Walther, for the invitation to OPEC to speak at this 6th Joint Oil Data Initiative Conference.

It truly gives me pleasure and pride to be with you today.

It is incredible to think that the 6th JODI Conference is already upon us. In fact, it is hard to believe that as many as 15 years have passed since the first meeting of what has become known as the IEF, was held in Paris.

The achievements of both in a relatively short period of time are remarkable. For anyone coming new to the industry, it might be presumed that JODI has been in existence for much longer than it has.

Its success in continually enhancing the transparency and the flow of information within the industry should be lauded by us all. As for the IEF, it has raised producer-consumer dialogue to new heights, giving it an authority and a presence that have exceeded many people’s expectations.

What is interesting is that it is very easy to take the activities of both the IEF and JODI for granted; a sure sign that they are considered integral to the global energy industry.

I would like to take this opportunity to praise the dedication and commitment of the various stakeholders and stress that OPEC sees the IEF and JODI as vital to the efficiency and effectiveness of our industry in the 21st century.

OPEC is proud to have been closely associated with the IEF from its humble beginnings and to have played a significant part in the development of JODI. We are also pleased that its permanent headquarters are located in an OPEC Member Country, and this, in turn, is symbolic of the importance we attach to dialogue and cooperation within the industry.

Please allow me first to return to the core theme of this conference: JODI. As many of you will remember, the Joint Oil Data Initiative was born out of the 8th IEF Meeting in Osaka in 2002. This eventually led to the seven international organizations behind this initiative opening the JODI World Database on the occasion of the inauguration of the IEF Secretariat just over a year ago.

This broad collection of responsible international organizations underscores the scope of the initiative. The term ‘World’ is not something we use lightly, but here we have a meeting of ‘World’ bodies focused on advancing the transparency and flows of global energy market data. As I am sure we all appreciate, any initiative on this scale is evolutionary, with continual improvements and updates part and parcel of the process.

The decision to open the JODI World Database this time last year was a bold one.

But, we feel that its development and the advancements in transparency since – set alongside actions to further strengthen the reporting expertise in countries and raise political awareness – has proved that the decision was the right one indeed.

We all realize that challenges remain – for example, expanding the number of countries taking part, reducing the delay in data submissions and further enhancing data quality.

OPEC, and I am sure all participating organizations, are committed to these objectives. It is important that JODI continually raises the industry bar with regards to data transparency, harmonization, quality and timeliness, and at the same time helps strengthen producer-consumer dialogue.

It is this final point I would like to conclude with. OPEC very much believes that enhanced international dialogue and cooperation gives the oil industry the best platform and advantages from which to collectively address current and future market challenges and opportunities.

To this end OPEC continues to devote much effort in this direction, with dialogue now being widened and deepened in an open, constructive and transparent industry. The most recent result of this was the establishment, last year, of energy dialogues between OPEC and, the EU, as well as with China, and Russia, and many other stakeholders.

The goal, and one OPEC very much adheres too, is a secure, stable and orderly market; a market where supply and demand are balanced and the necessary levels of investment, as well as prices, are acceptable to producers and consumers alike.

The focus must be on understanding the needs of each stakeholder and viewing the entire energy market holistically as it needs to be recognised that neither the public, or the private sector, or any one country, region nor organization can act alone. Global challenges require a global commitment.

The JODI community is demonstrating that these global challenges can be met head-on and have shown that the producer-consumer dialogue is not just about talk, it is about direct action.

Let me stress that you have OPEC’s full support and we hope that the JODI initiative will continue to go from strength-to-strength in harmonizing global energy statistics and enhancing dialogue.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/286-25-november-2006.html"
"2006-11-20","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking His Excellency Sayed Kazem Vaziri Hamaneh, the Minister of Petroleum of the Islamic Republic of Iran, for generously inviting me to address the 11th Annual International Oil and Gas Forum of the Institute for International Energy Studies. I am also indebted to the institute for making me feel so welcome here in Tehran, to participate in an event which promises to reveal valuable insights into the way the energy industry is run, particularly from the perspective of a leading hydrocarbons producer.

Although the purpose of the two-day meeting is to look at developments in world oil and gas, I shall focus on the oil sector, since OPEC is essentially an oil Organization. However, in doing this, I am not overlooking the fact that many OPEC Member Countries — and especially the Islamic Republic of Iran — have a strong base in the gas industry, as well as that of oil, and collectively account for around half the world’s proven natural gas reserves. This compares with nearly four-fifths of global proven crude oil reserves.

It is always very special to be in Iran, because this is a very interesting Member of OPEC in a number of ways.

[Slide 2] First of all, it has a heritage closely linked with the birth of civilisation as we know it today in the wider world. Its history has been traced back more than five millennia and has witnessed many remarkable advances which continue to shape our fundamental perceptions of life, even in the present digital era. And yet, just 27 years ago, Iran bravely embarked upon a new path of socioeconomic revolution which is visionary, principled and progressive, and has provided a compelling, viable alternative to the way modern societies can be run in the best interests of their peoples. In just one generation, there have been major advances in such important areas as health and education. It is no surprise that, in conformity with this progressive stance, the Islamic Republic is asserting its sovereign right to choose how it powers its national domestic, commercial and industrial infrastructures, in peaceful coexistence with other nations.

Secondly, Iran is an OPEC Member with a heavy involvement in both the oil and gas sectors. There is a neat symmetry about this, since the country possesses the world’s second-largest proven reserves of both crude oil and natural gas and is also ranked number four in terms of production of both — “marketed production” in the case of gas. Therefore, the Islamic Republic has a formidable presence in the international energy community and the potential to expand upon this in a big way in the future. In particular, the development of its gas export sector has huge implications for both the established consumer societies, such as those of the European Union, and the emerging economies, such as those of the neighbouring Indian sub-continent.

And thirdly, Iran is more than just an important, committed and very active Member of OPEC. It is also one of the five Founders of the Organization, playing a major role in its establishment in Baghdad nearly half a century ago. Indeed, it was only last year that the Islamic Republic hosted the 135th Meeting of the OPEC Conference in the historic city of Isfahan and treated us to the warm hospitality for which this country is famed. It was at that meeting that a major change was made in the way we assess world oil prices, when the Conference agreed to change the composition of the OPEC Reference Basket of crudes, which had been in operation for nearly two decades, to one which better reflected modern-day realities.

Indeed, that was not the first time that a Conference held in Iran had had a special historic significance. The 22nd Extraordinary Conference of early 1971 — held in this very city of Tehran — occurred in the midst of protracted negotiations between six OPEC Member Countries and many leading international oil companies, and, ten days later, this resulted in the signing of what became known as the ‘Tehran Agreement’. That agreement marked a major breakthrough for our Organization, when developing country oil producers, for the first time, acquired a major influence on the pricing of oil on world markets — oil that was extracted from within these countries’ sovereign territories.

Therefore, speaking to you in Tehran today, I feel that I am in a land that epitomises everything that is good about our cherished Organization!

[Slide 3] It is, indeed, very important to have the total commitment of all our Members to handling the challenges and opportunities that face us in the international oil market, as we seek to ensure that it functions in a stable and orderly manner at all times, in the interests of producers and consumers alike. It is a constantly shifting landscape, requiring continuous monitoring and the readiness and capability to take timely remedial actions, as and when necessary.

[Slide 4] If we look at the present situation, for example, we see that the past three months have witnessed a significant reversal of the trend of protracted upward pressure on prices that has been a dominant feature since spring 2004, and this is indicative of an over-supplied market. Indeed, the scale and speed of the decline in crude oil prices has caught the market by surprise. The OPEC Reference Basket has fallen by around $18–19 a barrel from a peak of $72.7/b on 8 August, the sharpest drop since 1991, as a result of changing fundamentals and easing geopolitical tensions.

[Slide 5] Additionally, very much as a result of OPEC’s production increases in recent years, commercial crude oil inventories in the OECD have risen to comfortable levels, well above the five-year average. Also, with the approach of the winter season, seasonally-important middle distillate stocks in the USA, including heating oil, are also at high levels and once again well above the five-year average as reported by recent weekly stocks data.

[Slide 6] The demand picture for the remainder of 2006 and for 2007 appears far from robust. The strong demand growth seen in 2004 declined sharply in 2005, and this deceleration has continued into 2006. This has happened, despite the strong momentum in the global economy. Demand growth in 2006 is now expected to remain moderate, at around 1.0 million barrels a day, and to reach 1.3 mb/d in 2007, although this requires a rebound from current trends.

On the supply side, the outlook for non-OPEC has changed dramatically, after non-OPEC supply growth had fallen behind world demand growth over the past few years — which had led to OPEC unexpectedly meeting the bulk of rising demand, to the tune of around 4.5 mb/d since 2002, while also accelerating plans to expand production capacity. Non-OPEC supply has already picked up by 0.9 mb/d in 2006 and is expected to grow next year at 1.8 mb/d, the highest rate since 1984, pointing to a clear imbalance between supply and demand. Growth in non-OPEC supply is expected to exceed growth in world demand by around 0.7 mb/d in 2007, indicating the need for measures to rebalance a market already flush with stocks. As a result, the demand for OPEC oil will be 28.1 mb/d, around 1.6 mb/d lower than total OPEC production in September.

Overall, the recent developments have triggered a strong bearish sentiment in the market, leading to concern that the downward momentum might persist and take prices lower than might otherwise be expected. Past experience has shown that it is in the long-term interest of both producers and consumers to maintain prices at levels that both support healthy economic growth, as well as encourage investment in capacity to meet current and future demand, particularly in an industry with long lead-times and high financial risks and in an environment of rising costs. In fact, this matter was discussed at length at the Informal Meeting of High-Level Experts from OPEC and Non-OPEC Producing Countries in Mexico a fortnight ago.

It also constituted the sentiment that prevailed at a special Consultative Meeting of the Conference OPEC held in Doha, Qatar, on 20 October. After reflecting on the outlook for the rest of this year and all of 2007, the Conference decided to realign its production by 1.2 mb/d to 26.3 mb/d, with effect from the beginning of this month, so as to help stabilise the market. A further review of the situation will take place at the next Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference in Nigeria on 14 December.

The Doha Conference effectively marked a turning-point for OPEC, in line with the changing market outlook. After a two-year period in which it had focused its efforts on increasing production levels and accelerating capacity-expansion plans, in order to counter the exceptional, volatile upward pressure on prices at that time, the Organization responded to the evolving new need to resist, at its early stages, a possible heavy downward price spiral, which was as potentially damaging to the market at large as the upward trend. Such flexibility in its actions is typical of OPEC, as it seeks to achieve lasting order and stability in the market, at prices acceptable to producers and consumers alike.

This policy extends across all time-horizons, as was made clear at the Third OPEC International Seminar in Vienna two months ago, which attracted participants from the highest levels of government, industry and academia in both richer and poorer nations. An overriding message to emerge from that event was that fossil fuels will continue to dominate the global energy mix for decades to come and will remain vital for supporting the forecast expansion in global economic growth. This ties in very much with our own forecasts.

[Slide 7] OPEC’s reference case scenario puts average annual oil demand growth at 1.6 per cent for the period up to 2025; this is a sizeable 36 per cent taken across the entire 20-year period. [Slide 8] The transportation sector will be the main source of future oil demand growth, due to its heavy reliance on liquid fuels and the absence of viable alternatives on a large commercial scale. Developing countries, especially from Asia, are set to account for four-fifths of the rise, with consumption almost doubling to 53 mb/d. However, in 2025, OECD countries will remain the dominant oil consumer and will continue to use, on average, five times more oil per person than developing countries. Similar conclusions appear in the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) recently-released World Energy Outlook 2006, although there are variations in the actual figures.

[Slide 9] The global resource base is sufficient to deal with the forecast increases in world oil demand well into the future. Estimates of global ultimately recoverable resources for conventional oil have been increasing, due to such factors as technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery from existing fields. Technological progress should also allow the development of large amounts of unconventional oil at lower cost, such as gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids, tar sands and heavy oil. With specific regard to biofuels, these are still expensive to produce and generally require government support to make them competitive.

Indeed, when you think about it, it is rather ironic that many influential interests in the developed world are all too ready to criticise the governments of oil-producing developing countries for subsidising domestic fuel supplies, and, yet, at the same time, these same interests condone the use of subsidies for the development of their own biofuels and other renewable forms of energy! And they are very often the same people who keep reminding us of the virtues of the free market!

[Slide 10] Non-OPEC supply has the potential to rise substantially in the medium term, but this is forecast to reach a plateau after 2015, at 58–59 mb/d. Thus, in the longer term, it is expected that OPEC, with nearly four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel of demand, to ensure that the market remains well-supplied with crude, at reasonable prices that are compatible with robust growth in the world economy. We are also seeking to produce oil in a cleaner and more efficient way than ever before, so as to meet the increasingly stringent demands of the modern consumer in rich and poor countries alike. Our projections show that OPEC production levels, including natural gas liquids, will rise to 54 mb/d by 2025, which will be slightly below that of non-OPEC.

[Slide 11] Moreover, if we look at the major interregional flows of crude oil from the perspective of exporters, as expected by 2015, we can see the major role of the Persian Gulf as a whole and, notably, the heavy concentration of its exports to Asia. With 18 per cent of the region’s proven crude oil reserves — as well as more than double this proportion of its natural gas, at 38 per cent — clearly Iran will remain a major player in this hydrocarbon-rich area.

[Slide 12] The figures are equally impressive in global terms, with Iran possessing 12 per cent of the world’s proven crude oil reserves and 15 per cent of its natural gas. Indeed, if we return to the reserve strength and production level discrepancy, to which I referred at the start of this address, we see that Iran accounts for just 5.7 per cent of world crude oil production — in other words, in percentage-point terms, less than half the figure for reserves. The discrepancy is even greater for natural gas, where marketed production is just 3.3 per cent of the world figure — in percentage-point terms, just over a fifth of its global reserve share.

The underlying message of all this is the huge potential the Islamic Republic has to expand its presence within the global hydrocarbons sector for decades to come, and the Iranian Government’s recognition of this and plans to invest heavily in further developing this vital industry right along the supply chain and increasing its global outreach are crucial to the future of the country. On top of this is the fact that the relatively low costs of production make upstream investment highly conducive to its profitability.

The challenges and opportunities facing the Islamic Republic are recognised by OPEC at large and are mirrored across the Organization, in accordance with individual resource endowments, domestic policies and other national attributes. Significantly, they demonstrate the willingness and ability of OPEC and its Member Countries to supply the incremental barrel and the seriousness they attach to the future of the oil industry.

[Slide 13] But it is not all plain sailing and, when the wind picks up, many practical difficulties can manifest themselves. Among them are the problems for effective investment strategies created by uncertainties over such key factors as world economic growth levels, advances in technology and policy measures in consuming countries. OPEC scenarios have illustrated how, even over the medium term to 2010, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment, and this increases to as much as $240 bn by 2020. Thus there is a heavy burden of risk for producer countries, with the huge amounts of capital that must be committed up front and the long lead times. Similarly, the IEA’s World Energy Outlook expresses concern about the impact of uncertainties.

This is why OPEC repeatedly calls for more transparency in the evolution and implementation of policies among consuming countries, so that better assessments can be made to undertake the appropriate capacity expansions and prevent waste of precious financial resources. Perhaps the international oil companies with substantive investment portfolios in oil-producing developing countries should do everything they can to impress this fact upon their host governments in consuming countries.

[Slide 14] Another aspect is the cost of infrastructure, such as rigs and tankers, as well as the cost and availability of human resources. For example, drilling costs have increased by 50 per cent since 2003, with steel prices rising by 40 per cent since 2004. In 2005 alone, wages in the industry increased by about 15 per cent. We believe that better cooperation between the international and national oil companies could lead to significant cost reductions in such areas. Furthermore, the number of students enrolling in petroleum-related courses has also shown a significant decline since the mid-1980s, and we need to make the industry attractive to prospective graduates and employees the world over.

Notably, enhancing cohesion among Member Countries is of crucial importance here. As the OPEC Long-Term Strategy puts it: “The Organization should expand intra-OPEC interactions, networking and dialogue at the level of Ministers of Petroleum/Energy and national oil companies. Cooperation should also be pursued in the technological and scientific areas of higher education in Member Countries.”

[Slide 15] In addition, downstream tightness, in the form of inadequate refining capacity in some leading industrialised countries, has been putting a lot of pressure on oil price levels and differentials over the past couple of years. Despite the number of major refining projects worldwide, the long construction lead times, combined with typical delays and project terminations, will most likely mean that the existing refining tightness will not ease until at least 2009 or 2010.

[Slide 16] It is estimated that $160 bn in downstream capacity investment will be required by 2015, with another $150 bn needed for maintenance and replacement of lost capacity. However, present commitments leave a shortfall of around $100 bn. Our Member Countries are very concerned about this part of the international supply chain and have a growing amount of investment downstream, including joint ventures in refining and petrochemicals in key markets. However, there is only so much OPEC can do downstream, since this is essentially and traditionally the domain of consuming countries, which have the primary responsibility for investment in this sector.

[Slide 17] OPEC is also very committed to efforts to protect the environment, as one of the three pillars of sustainable development, as defined at the world summit on this crucial human issue in Johannesburg in 2002. Both collectively and at individual Member Country level, with mutual encouragement and collaboration all round, the Organization has participated actively and with resolution in all the major meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as well as the Kyoto Protocol. Indeed, we were well represented at the 12th Conference of the Parties to the Convention which has just been held in Nairobi, Kenya.

This topic is, of course, a familiar one to our friends in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which ratified the convention in 1996 and the protocol in 2005.

However, we are quite clear in OPEC about the nature of our commitment, since it must be centred around the principles of ‘common, but differentiated responsibilities’ and ‘respective capabilities’. Developing countries, including Members of our cherished Organization, have not been responsible for the historic emissions that are having such an impact on the world environment today. Their root causes can be found in the industrialised societies that emerged in Europe in the 18th century and subsequently proliferated among what are now considered to be the richer nations of the world. Furthermore, developing countries are neither technologically or financially capable of adapting to the negative impacts on the environment. Indeed, policy measures adopted by major industrialised countries to combat climate change can easily have a negative impact on the economic wellbeing of our Member Countries. Therefore, we fervently believe that any ‘post-Kyoto’ agreement must adequately and comprehensively address these concerns, so as to ensure a fair and balanced global approach to handling these very serious issues.

The other two pillars of sustainable development are social and economic development, and OPEC is deeply aware of the needs of other developing countries, as they seek access to modern energy services to transform their domestic infrastructures, sometimes from a state of extreme poverty. Without outside assistance, many appear to have no means of escape from the poverty trap. As developing countries ourselves, we are constantly mindful of the fact that poverty eradication is the first UN Millennium Development Goal.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The theme of this forum encompasses a wide range of global energy issues, and, even though I have confined my comments to the oil sector, I feel that time constraints have prevented me from doing full justice to some important subject-matter.

[Slide 18] Nevertheless, I hope I have managed to convey to you the true extent of the challenges facing oil-producing developing countries like the Islamic Republic of Iran and my own Federal Republic of Nigeria. In a nutshell, these are to provide regular supplies of crude to consumers at reasonable prices both now and in the future and to use the resulting revenue for several distinct purposes beyond the normal commercial ones: first, to help develop our domestic economies and provide better life-styles for our citizens; secondly, to plough back into the industry to ensure that future consumer needs are well-catered for the world over; and thirdly, to provide assistance to other impoverished nations in the true spirit of sustainable development, as encapsulated at the World Summit in Johannesburg four years ago.

[Slide 19] To address such challenges, there is widespread agreement on the need for a constructive, sustained process of dialogue at a global level, involving all the interested parties and prepared to tackle all the major topical issues affecting the industry. In today’s globalised environment, interconnected through trade, no individual country or group of countries can comprehensively carry out this formidable task alone.

Such an awareness led to OPEC’s pioneering collaborative efforts to initiate producer-consumer dialogue 15 years ago and this has since been transformed into the International Energy Forum, which has its headquarters in another OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been an active participant in the forum since its inception, and, indeed, an official from this country has served with distinction on the forum’s Executive Board. This, in fact, is just one example of many forms of dialogue and cooperation our Organization and its Member Countries have been involved in over the years. Another form worthy of mention here relates to the formal energy dialogues OPEC set up with the European Union, China and Russia last year, and these have enormous potential for an enhancement of the already good relations between the respective groups. The EU-OPEC energy dialogue has led to a series of concrete proposals to jointly examine in depth topical matters of mutual interest, as well as embracing a proposal to establish an EU-OPEC technology centre.

Let me state here that full, meaningful dialogue is always preferable to other more direct and less constructive means of handling issues, and here I refer back to what I said at the start of this address — that every country has a sovereign right to decide how it powers its national domestic, commercial and industrial infrastructures, in peaceful coexistence with other nations. The choice of an optimal energy mix is the inalienable right of every country.

I should also like to point out that one of the difficulties facing oil producers from this part of the world especially is that their rich endowment of heavily demanded natural resources means that the international spotlight will always be focused on them, and — as we know too well — very often in a negative manner. In today’s world, this is unavoidable and something we must live, unfortunately.

[Slide 20] However, we should never allow this to distract us from the central task of meeting growing energy needs of the global community and, most especially, those of the world’s poorest nations in their long-overdue quest for sustainable development.

It is, therefore, up to all of us to rise to these challenges, and OPEC — including its esteemed Founder Member, the Islamic Republic of Iran — maintains its longstanding resolve to do this, to the benefit of producers and consumers alike and in support of sound, sustained growth across the global economy.

[Slide 21] Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/287-20-november-2006.html"
"2006-11-17","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

At the outset I would like to express my gratitude and deep appreciation to the Government and people of Kenya for their warm hospitality and excellent arrangements.

We are on African soil and in a Continent that is the cradle of humanity. This elevates the responsibility put on all of us to deliver and achieve successful outcomes.

It also reminds us that for developing countries, poverty alleviation, economic development and social progress are the overriding priorities. Climate change is adding more challenges and creating additional vulnerabilities for these countries, although they are not responsible for the current state of our planet.

OPEC therefore reiterates the importance of The United Nations Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol and calls for strict adherence to their fundamental principles, and in particular to common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

OPEC also calls for Annex-I Countries, in particular the large industrialised countries, to abide by their commitments and to take a decisive lead in combating climate change, both today and tomorrow.

Fifteen years have passed since the Rio Convention laid the foundations for addressing climate change, but industrialised nations are still far from contributing significantly to reducing their overall emissions level. These nations are also not fulfilling their many obligations vis-à-vis developing countries in general, and in particular to those whose economies are highly dependent on the export of fossil fuels as enshrined in Article 4.8 of the Convention and Articles 2.3, and 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol.

Energy is fundamental for economic development and social progress. While the use of all forms of energy is welcome, it is clear that fossil fuels will continue to satisfy the lion’s share of the world’s growing energy needs for decades to come. Consequently, OPEC considers that it is extremely important to promote cleaner fossil fuel technologies, including carbon capture and storage (CCS), a promising technology that has the potential to contribute significantly to emissions reduction by the middle of the century. Industrialised countries should take the lead in the funding and execution of large CCS demonstration projects. It is also vital to make this technology eligible to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), sooner rather than later. OPEC has recently organised, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and jointly with the European Union, a Roundtable on CCS.

More generally, while we have taken note with interest of the increasing role of the CDM, OPEC considers that this mechanism has to be reformed to overcome its limitations, posed by – inter alia – unequal regional and sectoral distribution of projects, financing barriers, operational efficiency and additionality requirements.

OPEC considers that efforts should not be limited to mitigation, but should increasingly encompass adaptation to climate change, in particular for developing countries, and as such welcomes the recent advances regarding the Adaptation Fund.

OPEC calls for increased financial contributions to all the funds that have been established in the context of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol and stresses that further progress needs to be made in the essential CDM components of capacity building and technology transfer.

In closing, I would like to say that we all recognise the importance of this meeting. It is a critical juncture in the further development and strengthening of a truly global and multilateral climate change regime. One where we build a future that not only recognises disparities between the North and the South, but actively works to address them.

Thus we need to work together, not against each other. This is the spirit that originally brought us together under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol and it is the spirit we need in order to crystallise a successful second commitment period. I will therefore press upon industrialised country Parties to steer clear of insisting on calls to discuss further commitments for developing countries at this stage. This will not solve the climate change problem we are facing today and it is certainly not conducive to a productive and convivial atmosphere.

Rather, I would call on you to demonstrate to developing countries, in a transparent manner, your willingness to fulfil current commitments under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. The aim should be to assist developing countries in the advancement of their capabilities and to tackle the dichotomy posed by economic growth and rising greenhouse gas emissions. If this is the aim, I feel we can work together constructively in meeting the climate change challenge.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/288-17-november-2006.html"
"2006-10-30","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me first thank the organisers for inviting me to address this plenary session of the Sixth Russian Oil and Gas Week. ‘Moscow week’ has now become an established part of the international energy calendar and provides an outstanding forum for high-level discussions on topical issues affecting the industry.

As a major player in the global energy arena, Russia’s views on international energy issues are, as ever, eagerly sought within the industry at large. Not only is Russia the world’s largest producer of natural gas and, increasingly, crude oil, as well as having the biggest proven natural gas reserves. But it is also having a rising influence on the consumer side, especially as one of the four ‘Bric’ countries, with large populations and high economic growth potential.

Russia has been a key figure in the global energy debate this year. In particular, its chairmanship of the G8 summit in St Petersburg in July culminated in a long-overdue, broader-based approach by consuming countries to the fundamental issue of energy security. This indicated a shift away from longstanding narrow, self-interested perceptions of energy security to a greater appreciation of its broader, more universal nature, especially with regard to the fact that security of supply and security of demand are mutually supportive. They must go hand-in-hand as a means of achieving market stability.

This breakthrough — as we consider it in OPEC — owes much to the advances in dialogue and cooperation that have occurred since late last century, and Russia has had a prominent role to play in these. Indeed, the security issue has featured in the energy dialogue established between Russia and OPEC in December last year. We have also welcomed the support Russia has given to our market-stabilisation measures in recent years.

The simple message is that, if we all want a better-performing market now and in the future, then it is the responsibility of all of us — all parties in the industry — to work towards achieving this.

This is especially pertinent to the subject-matter of this plenary session: “Global energy industry — current challenges and opportunities”, which I shall now address. In doing so, I shall focus on the oil sector, since this constitutes the core area of OPEC’s activities.

However, first and foremost, it is necessary to look at the current oil market outlook, in the light of the recent downturn in prices.

[Slide 2] The past two months have witnessed a significant reversal of the trend of protracted upward pressure on prices that has been a dominant feature since spring 2004, and this is indicative of an over-supplied market. Indeed, the scale and speed of the decline in crude oil prices has caught the market by surprise. The OPEC Reference Basket has fallen by more than $19 a barrel from a peak of $72.7/b on 8 August, the sharpest drop since 1991, as a result of changing fundamentals and easing geopolitical tensions.

[Slide 3] Additionally, very much as a result of OPEC’s production increases in recent years, commercial crude oil inventories in the OECD have risen to comfortable levels, well above the five-year average. Also, with the approach of the winter season, seasonally-important middle distillate stocks in the USA are also at their highest level since 1999, once again well above the five-year average.

[Slide 4] The demand picture for the remainder of 2006 and for 2007 appears far from robust. The strong demand growth seen in 2004 declined sharply in 2005, and this deceleration has continued into 2006. This has happened, despite the strong momentum in the global economy. Demand growth in 2006 is now expected to remain moderate, at 1.0 mb/d, and to reach 1.3 mb/d in 2007, although this requires a rebound from current trends.

On the supply side, the outlook for non-OPEC has changed dramatically, after non-OPEC supply growth had fallen behind world demand growth over the past few years — which had led to OPEC unexpectedly meeting the bulk of rising demand, to the tune of around 4.5 million barrels a day since 2002, while also accelerating plans to expand production capacity. Non-OPEC supply has already picked up by 1.1 mb/d in 2006 and is expected to grow next year at 1.8 mb/d, the highest rate since 1984, pointing to a clear imbalance between supply and demand.

Given these trends, the demand for OPEC crude in 2007 will be lower than this year. Non-OPEC supply is expected to exceed demand by around 0.8 mb/d in 2007, indicating the need for measures to rebalance a market already flush with stocks. As a result, the demand for OPEC oil would be 28.1 mb/d, around 1.4 mb/d lower than total OPEC production in September.

Overall, the recent developments have triggered a strong bearish sentiment in the market, leading to concern that the downward momentum might persist and take prices lower than otherwise might be expected. Past experience has shown that it is in the long-term interest of both producers and consumers to maintain prices at levels that both support healthy economic growth, as well as encourage investment in capacity to meet future demand, particularly in an industry with long lead-times and high financial risks and in an environment of rising costs.

In order to review the situation more carefully, OPEC held a special Consultative Meeting of its Conference in Qatar on 20 October. After reflecting on the outlook for the rest of this year and all of 2007, the Conference observed that OPEC’s actions in recent years had contributed to market stability and assured adequate supplies, benefiting all parties. It was noted with concern, however, that crude oil supplies were well above actual demand and that this situation of imbalance was destabilising the market. Thus, in order to ensure market stability, the Conference decided to reduce production by 1.2 mb/d to 26.3 mb/d, with effect from 1 November. A further review of the situation will take place at the next Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference in Nigeria on 14 December.

At the Qatar meeting, the Conference repeated its longstanding call for non-OPEC producers to continue cooperating actively with the Organization, in its ongoing efforts to achieve market stability, with reasonable prices that are consistent with robust economic growth and steady revenue streams for investors.

OPEC, of course, also looks beyond the near term and, in Vienna six weeks ago, we held the Third OPEC International Seminar. An overriding message to emerge from that event, whose participants came from the highest levels of government, industry and academia, was that fossil fuels will continue to dominate the global energy mix for decades to come and will remain vital for supporting the forecast expansion in global economic growth. This ties in very much with our own forecasts.

[Slide 5] OPEC’s reference case scenario puts average annual oil demand growth at 1.6 per cent for the period 2005–25; this is a sizeable 36 per cent taken across the entire 20-year period. [Slide 6] The transportation sector will be the main source of future oil demand growth, due to its heavy reliance on liquid fuels and the absence of viable alternatives on a large commercial scale. Developing countries, especially from Asia, are set to account for four-fifths of the rise, with consumption almost doubling to 53 mb/d. However, in 2025, OECD countries will remain the dominant oil consumer and will continue to use, on average, five times more oil per person than developing countries.

[Slide 7] The global resource base is sufficient to deal with the forecast increases in world oil demand well into the future. Estimates of global ultimately recoverable resources for conventional oil have been increasing, due to such factors as technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery from existing fields. Technological progress should also allow the development of large amounts of unconventional oil at lower cost, such as gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids, tar sands and heavy oil. With specific regard to biofuels, these are still expensive to produce and generally require government support to make them competitive.

[Slide 8] Non-OPEC supply has the potential to rise substantially in the medium term, but this is forecast to reach a plateau after 2015, at 58–59 mb/d. Thus, in the longer term, it is expected that OPEC, with nearly four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel of demand, to ensure that the market remains well-supplied with crude, at reasonable prices that are compatible with robust growth in the world economy. We are also seeking to produce oil that is cleaner and more efficient than ever before, so as to meet the increasingly stringent demands of the modern consumer in rich and poor countries alike. Our projections show that OPEC production levels, including natural gas liquids, will rise to 54 mb/d by 2025, which will be slightly below that of non-OPEC.

[Slide 9] OPEC’s willingness and ability to supply the incremental barrel demonstrates the seriousness it attaches to the future of the oil industry. However, there are obstacles, with uncertainties over future levels of oil demand translating into a wide range of possible levels of necessary investment in OPEC Member Countries. These are caused, in particular, by uncertainties over world economic growth, advances in technology and policy measures in consuming countries. Even over the medium term to 2010, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment, and this increases to as much as $240 bn by 2020. Thus there is a heavy burden of risk for these countries, with the huge amounts of capital that must be committed up front and the long lead times. This is why OPEC repeatedly calls for more transparency in the evolution and implementation of policies among consuming countries, so that better assessments can be made to undertake the appropriate capacity expansions and prevent waste of precious financial resources.

[Slide 10] OPEC is also eager to address the challenges arising from the growing fears among the public at large about global warming, as articulated in the activities of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and, specifically, the Kyoto Protocol. In September, for example, OPEC participated in a couple of high-level meetings in Saudi Arabia, where the principal focus was on this very important issue — the First International Conference on the Clean Development Mechanism and the EU-OPEC Joint Roundtable on Carbon Capture and Storage. Implicit throughout was the need for a collective approach to handling the climate change issue from the world community at large, since the challenges not only transcend national borders, but they are also no respecters of continental landmasses! They are truly global.

If one is intent on reducing emissions, one must face the fact that the heavy reliance the world will have upon fossil fuels well into this century is not sustainable without carbon capture and storage (CCS). The EU, with whom we co-hosted the second meeting, is particularly strong on this issue, just as we are, and both parties recognise that the technology for CCS already exists and that what is required now is action to raise awareness of this. Indeed, CCS can also be used in conjunction with carbon dioxide-enhanced oil recovery, which offers a ‘win-win’ opportunity by not only storing CO2, but also increasing oil reserves in mature fields. Moreover, we also believe that the developed countries should take the lead in the area of providing cleaner oil and gas technologies by promoting large-scale demonstration projects, including the use of the clean development mechanism, in accordance with the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” and respective capabilities.

Clean and safe energy is also a vital requirement for developing countries as they seek access to modern energy services in their often protracted struggle for socioeconomic development, sometimes from a state of extreme poverty. Without outside assistance, many appear to have no means of escape from the poverty trap. We are constantly mindful of the fact that poverty eradication is the first UN Millennium Development Goal, and a comprehensive and balanced approach to implementing the three pillars of sustainable development — economic development, social development and environmental protection — is required.

[Slide 11] Furthermore, downstream tightness in the form of inadequate refining capacity has been putting much pressure on oil prices generally over the past couple of years. In addition, there will be rising volumes of crude oil that need to be refined, as well as the expectation of a continued move towards demand for lighter and cleaner products. On top of this, it is estimated that additional desulphurisation capacity of more than 20 mb/d will be required over the next ten years. It is estimated that $160 bn in downstream capacity investment will be required by 2015, with another $150 bn needed for maintenance and replacement of lost capacity. However, present commitments leave a shortfall of around $100 bn. A more concerted effort is needed to ensure that sufficient capacities are in place, otherwise the indications are that this sector could remain a key source of price volatility. However, it must not be forgotten that the primary responsibility for investment in this sector lies with consuming countries.

[Slide 12] Another aspect is the cost of infrastructure, such as rigs and tankers, as well as the cost and availability of human resources. For example, upstream costs have increased by 50 per cent since 2003, with steel prices rising by 40 per cent since 2004. In 2005 alone, wages in the industry increased by about 15 per cent. Furthermore, the number of students enrolling in petroleum engineering courses has also shown a significant decline since the mid-1980s, and we need to make the industry attractive to prospective graduates and employees the world over.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

[Slide 13] Clearly from everything I have said, the challenges facing the oil industry in the coming decades are substantial and require a concerted effort from all parties if the industry is to evolve in an orderly, stable manner. The opportunities are there for us to meet these challenges and we must all play our part to ensure that we use them to the full, to the benefit of producers and consumers alike and of the development of mankind generally.

[Slide 14] Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/289-30-october-2006.html"
"2006-09-19","Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

It gives me great pleasure to be the keynote speaker at the first International Conference on the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Let me repeat the last part of the sentence: ‘the FIRST International Conference on the CDM’. Given that the CDM has been on the table for over eight years it is surprising that this is the ‘first international conference’. As I will underline, this situation very much mirrors how the CDM is playing out in reality.

So let me initially congratulate OPEC founding member, Saudi Arabia, for hosting this historic event. At OPEC, we concur with and support the original objectives of the CDM, the Kyoto Protocol and the UNFCCC process and as such it heartens me to witness this event taking place in Riyadh; a clear demonstration of Saudi Arabia’s and OPEC’s commitment to the CDM.

In fact, Saudi Arabia, under the extremely able and intuitive guidance of HE Ali I. Naimi the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, has always been very dedicated in its commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol process. I would like therefore to take this opportunity to commend HE Naimi for his consistency in providing the much needed leadership to us in OPEC during this process and for his active participation in all COP meetings. I would also like to acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by our Conference Chairman, Dr Mohammed Al-Sabban who has remained in the vanguard of defending the interests of OPEC in this process.

[Before moving on, I would also I like to congratulate Yvo de Boer on his appointment as the new Executive Secretary of the United Nations Climate Change Secretariat. This is a well deserved appointment and at OPEC we look forward to working closely with you and the Secretariat in a positive and constructive manner.]

From reviewing the speaking panel, I can see we will be hearing from a wide and varied collection of industry stakeholders and I hope that over the next few days we can together paint a clearer picture of how the CDM is, or is not reaching its objectives. This is in fact the basis of my presentation today, ‘CDM: Is it meeting the expectations?’, but before we look at the current picture, allow me this opportunity to take you back to the origins of the CDM.

As many of you may well be aware, in the run up to the Kyoto meeting, OPEC Member Countries proposed that a “Compensation Fund” be established for adverse impacts arising from the implementation of response measures by Annex I countries on developing countries. This proposal was formally included in the G-77&China position unveiled in 1997, [but the idea of compensation never received widespread support from developed country Parties.]

The follow-up concept came from a Brazilian proposal in June 1997, just prior to the announcement of the Kyoto Protocol agreement. Brazil proposed that Annex I Parties should be subject to a financial penalty if they did not comply with their quantified commitments under the Protocol. The fine levied would be proportionate to the level of non-compliance and would be paid into a “Clean Development Fund” that would be leveraged to support sustainable development projects in developing countries, having in mind those Parties listed under Art 4.8 of the Convention.

Both proposals were indeed in accordance with Article 4.8 (h) of the UNFCCC that states that Parties shall give full consideration to what actions are necessary under the Convention, including actions related to funding, insurance and the transfer of technology, to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties, arising from the adverse effects of climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response measures on countries whose economies are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing and export, and/or on consumption of fossil fuels and associated energy-intensive products.

The Brazilian proposal was rallied behind by developing countries, but the concept once again proved unpalatable to developed country Parties due to the contentious issue of financial penalties for non-compliance as well as the notion of compensating oil exporting countries.

The idea of a penalty for lack of compliance by Annex I Parties was thus transformed into a ‘mechanism for investment’. This then formed the basis from which the CDM was born in the wee hours of the last day of COP3. As the Conference Chairman, Dr Mohammed Al-Sabban stated in an introduction on this conference’s website, the CDM should be, “a win for the investor, a win for the country hosting the project, and a win for the environment”. The CDM, as defined under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol, has three key objectives: to assist non-Annex I countries in achieving sustainable development; to contribute to the ultimate goal of the convention, to stabilise emissions to the atmosphere; and assist Annex I countries comply with their emission reduction commitments at the least possible cost.

The deal for developing countries was the opportunity to access much needed investment, capacity building and technology transfer. This would pave the way for these countries to explore cleaner, more environmentally friendly ways to develop while continuing to further the advancement of the three pillars of sustainable development, namely economic growth, social progress, and environmental protection, at both the local and global level. Consistent with the Bonn Agreement, developing country governments also have the prerogative to judge how the projects will meet their sustainable development goals. For Annex I industrialised countries, the arrangement would allow them to lower the cost of meeting their quantified emission reductions by making emissions cuts outside their own borders. These two elements combined would then, in turn, help stabilise emission levels.

Given that all our OPEC Member Countries are developing nations, let me offer a few pointers as to what is at stake for us and developing countries in general (even at the risk of sounding monotonous) - that it is developing nations that are most in need of expanded energy services to meet their growth and development needs. It should be continuously remembered that 1.1 billion people are currently living on less than $1 a day, 1.6 billion people currently lack access to modern energy services and almost two billion have no electricity. It needs to be remembered that the very first UN Millennium Development Goal stresses the critical importance of reducing by half those living in these conditions by 2012.

It is clear therefore, that access to modern energy services plays a crucial role in the fight to alleviate and eventually eradicate poverty. In turn, investment, capacity building and technology transfer are necessary policy ingredients if we are to dramatically expand the reach of affordable, improved energy services and to be better equipped to adapt to the negative impacts of climate change.

Today, it is patently obvious that the three key objectives of the CDM, as originally envisaged, have not gone to plan. Initially lauded as the basis for the future development of the Kyoto Protocol and deemed significant as it brought together the interests of countries of the North and countries of the South, it has remained a mechanism with potential.

To date, the scale of investment has not provided the much expected benefits to the particular conditions and needs of developing country Parties. The investment in capacity building has been minimal and the transfer of technology has been almost inconsequential and where it has occurred it has focused narrowly on just a few activities of interest to developed countries markets. [Allow me to explore some of the most significant problems, and in turn challenges, in more detail.]

One major failure is the non-performance of the CDM in some parts of the world. This is particularly apparent in Africa. The CDM needs to make inroads into every sinew of the developing world. This is the scale of the challenge we face. Capacity building and appropriate investment are critical to bringing many people out of poverty, while the industrialised world leads the way in its efforts to change unsustainable patterns of consumption and production.

The CDM is, at present, an entirely market driven mechanism, which is at odds with satisfying its other two aims, namely to contribute to the sustainable development of developing nations and to provide a vehicle for the effective transfer of technology. [It is also clear that any private investor has a short-term vision guided by the need to get the greatest return on investment in a very limited timeframe. Let me stress, however, that this does mean I am in not in favour of a fair return on investment, but if this is a challenge of a truly global scale, recognised as such by the international treaties, we must all work together to find ways to ensure that all Parties are fairly treated, particularly developing countries.]

In order to finance CDM projects, we are required to tax earnings from the sale of Certified Emissions Reduction (CER) units accruing from these projects. Therefore, even the ‘Adaptation Fund’, is effectively financed by a tax levied on earnings accruing to one group of developing countries in solidarity with another group of developing countries.

Furthermore, the administrative costs of registering a project by the CDM Executive Board are covered by project developers, which once again means that host countries (developing countries) effectively pay the bill. Hence, the objective of cost minimisation to Annex I Parties is fully realised, while other objectives important to developing countries are sidelined.

The market-based approach also means that real technology transfer and capacity building for sustainable development are simply not attractive to project financiers. Furthermore, ‘unilateral CDM’ is a term we see increasingly creeping into the remit of CDM, in fact, nearly one third of the proposed CDM projects are designated as ‘unilateral’. This means that the Project Design Document (PDD) is submitted without an Annex I investor. This is not how CDM was envisaged to work, as put simply ‘unilateral CDM’ is as an opportunity for private sector initiatives, to participate in the emissions trading market at their own risk. Where is the technology transfer, capacity building or partnership in this?

In many instances the transactions costs, when viewed against the scale of projects and their positive impact on host countries, are also prohibitive to developing countries. Just registering a project can incur costs of between €60,000 and €120,000. Add to this the annual running costs for monitoring and verification, an adaptation levy of two per cent on the value of CERs, a five-to-10 per cent levy on the value of CERs when sold, as well as the uncertain cost of risk mitigation, and the overall costs significantly mount. It begs the question: do the costs outweigh the benefits, particularly when there are no economies of scale that make any significant contribution to sustainable development by way of technology transfer, capacity building or contributions to improve employment rates?

Fellow delegates, you may also be interested in OPEC’s point of view from an oil market perspective. Our Organization sees fossil fuel use, and energy in general, very much in the context of sustainable development.

We do acknowledge that renewables, such as biofuels and wind energy, have a role to play in the global energy mix, but it will be many decades before any of these alternatives acquire a significant share of the global energy mix. Therefore, the evaluation of energy sources should be undertaken in accordance with a balanced criteria: reliability, affordability, economic viability, social acceptance and environmental soundness. Oil, as the leading fuel in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future, is very much integral to this.

As was underlined by numerous speakers at the 3rd OPEC International Seminar last week in Vienna, it means that technological options that allow the continued use of fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained world must be actively promoted. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), in conjunction with CO2-enhanced oil recovery, offers a win-win opportunity by not only storing CO2, but also increasing oil reserves in mature fields. OPEC would like to see the CDM be adapted to facilitate the application of cleaner fossil fuel technologies such as CCS in developing countries.

A demonstration of OPEC’s commitment to the environment– aside from those undertaken by our individual Member Countries- can also be viewed in its active participation in the IEA’s Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, and following this conference, an OPEC-EU Roundtable on Carbon Capture and Storage will be held in the context of our ongoing dialogue with our friends from the European Union.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

So where do we stand today? Putting this all in the broader context of the Kyoto Protocol we must remember that for any international agreement to succeed, the interests of all stakeholders must be taken into account and comprehensively addressed. To date, the European Union (EU) has been almost solely focused on emissions trading, which is very much the centre piece of their climate change strategy, to the exclusion of others. In fact, in the EU Green Paper on Energy, there is only a passing mention to the CDM. This is specifically in relation to renewables and how they could help many developing countries reduce their reliance on imported oil.

However, even in the EU, there is an increasing recognition that many industrialised countries will not be able to meet their emissions targets with the current mechanism being utilised. The latest figures, released by the European Commission in June, show that EU emissions rose by 0.4 per cent in 2004 relative to the previous year.

There has also been concern that EU Member States have given their industries too many pollution permits under the EU ETS, which has meant that there has been a surplus of ‘carbon credits’ to sell on the ETS market, causing the price of carbon to fall dramatically. In late April and early May this year, the price of carbon emissions dropped 60 per cent in a week, from about €30 to €12. This development may force governments to confront the question as to whether this market can, in reality, deliver the required reductions in GHG emissions.

Yet it should be recognised that all three Kyoto mechanisms, Emissions Trading, Joint Implementation and CDM, are integral to the Protocol’s success. The flaws of the CDM must be corrected in order to prevent the whole Protocol from becoming flawed. We all need to think long and hard, and turn this thinking into concrete actions, if we are going to take both the CDM and the overall Kyoto framework forward. This needs to take into account both for the current, and the post-2012 period.

Let me conclude by putting forward a very simple question. To date, are we meeting the ultimate goals of the Kyoto Protocol, to support sustainable development and reduce emissions? It is our sincere hope that this epoch making conference will at the end answer this and often fundamental questions on the CDM. It is also our hope that the outcomes will also feed into the next round of post Kyoto negotiations that would re-brand the CDM to meet the objectives of both developed and developing country Parties, including OPEC.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/290-19-september-2006.html"
"2006-09-13","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

We have reached the end of the Third OPEC International Seminar, and it is my task to provide some closing remarks. It is a sad task, because we shall be closing the door on lively and stimulating debate, as well as bidding farewell to friends and associates. However, it is also a privilege and an honour to be entrusted with such an undertaking, at a gathering of such eminent people from different parts of the world energy industry, in the fields of government, industry, academia and the media.

As with all such events — and this seminar has been an outstanding example — our minds have been assailed by a torrent of ideas, information, statistics, interpretations and visions, and it will probably be a day or two before we can sift through them all consolidate our own personal perspectives. There is, indeed, plenty to reflect upon and, if this in any way enhances our individual and collective contributions to meeting the global energy challenges, then the seminar can truly be adjudged a success.

As we have heard over the past two days, there is plenty of oil around to meet global needs for generations to come, and the industry must ensure, at all times, that the world’s precious hydrocarbon reserves are accessed, processed and distributed to consumers in a timely and orderly manner, with stable, reasonable prices. The challenge remains that of deliverability and not availability.

Consumers, in turn, must focus on enabling steady, predictable demand, so as to provide fertile ground for sound investment strategies in future production capacity, from which the world at large can benefit, rich and poor global citizens alike.

While it is still early days — pending deeper personal reflection — I am sure we have all benefited in some way from this Seminar. Numerous positions and points of view have been outlined and many messages have been delivered, covering the whole spectrum of energy as seen from the perspective of producers, consumers and investors alike. I would briefly like to review some of the main points aired during our deliberations.

The one overriding message is that

Finally, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

On behalf of you all, I should like to thank Their Excellencies the Ministers and Ambassadors, the heads of international organizations, the chief executives of national and international oil companies, and all the other speakers and panel members. Their presence has been invaluable and, without any doubt, has helped make the event a great success.

We greatly appreciate the support we have received from the members of the media, in covering our activities. It is very important that the views expressed here are disseminated to a wider readership and audience, and clearly this task has been in very capable hands.

We are also grateful to all those who have been involved in the organisation of the event. While they are too numerous to name individually, prominent among them are the CWC Group and the Secretariat Staff Members of the Seminar’s Steering Committee under the able leadership of Mr Mohammed S Barkindo the Acting for the Secretary General, Organizing and Technical Committees, as well as all members of the secretariat staff who spent time and effort to see this seminar through.. The authorities of the Congress Centre of the Hofburg Palace, the Austrian security forces also deserve our gratitude. And finally, of course, we cannot fail to thank our hosts, the government of Federal Republic of Austria and the good people of Vienna for their excellent hospitality, as well as the attendance of the Economy and Labour Minister Dr Martin Bartenstein, whose contribution we highly value.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Since the OPEC International Seminar is a biannual event, we look forward to seeing you again in 2008, when we shall reconvene to discuss another topical theme affecting the oil industry.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/291-13-september-2006.html"
"2006-09-12","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is with great pleasure that I address such a distinguished gathering at OPEC’s 3rd International Seminar. The event continues to go from strength-to-strength and it heartens me to see both familiar and new faces in the audience.

The topic I would like to elaborate on today is, ‘Energy Outlook: Challenges & Opportunities for OPEC’, which offers me a broad remit of topical issues. This is especially true given that anxiety and concern about local, regional and global energy security, top the political agendas of most countries, regarding not just oil, but the entire energy value chain. Amid such volatility and risk, uncertainty and challenges abound, but so too does opportunity.

[Slide 2] Let me begin by tackling the question that has recently captured many news headlines worldwide: why are oil prices at their current level? On the occasion of the last two Seminars, in September 2001 and September 2004, the OPEC Reference Basket stood at just above $20 and just below $40 a barrel, respectively. This summer it has risen to over $70 a barrel, before receding over the past few weeks by more than $10. Though it should be noted that in real terms these levels are still below those experienced in the early 1980s, when the Basket would have reached $85 at today’s prices, and it has also occurred at the same time as significant, sometimes even greater, rises in other energy and non-energy commodities. For example, nickel and copper prices have been multiplied by a factor of four since 2001.

[Slide 3] There is no straightforward answer to the question. What should be noted, however, is that although price rises make for easy news headlines, it is the volatility that should most concern the industry. For many observers, the recent price trend is in fact part of what some have labeled ‘a new energy era’ of shifting market dynamics. On the price issue, for instance, prior to 2004, there was a simple industry yardstick. If commercial stocks in consuming countries were high, then prices would generally fall. If these stocks were low, then the opposite was generally true. This yardstick had been one of the endemic ‘oil market fundamentals’. Yet today, while the level of OECD commercial stocks is high, in fact at its highest level since 1997, with OECD stocks currently providing 54 days of forward demand cover, oil prices as we all know have remained on the high-side.

The price rise has been influenced by a convergence of factors, including: strong economic growth, and, in turn, oil demand growth, which has risen to unexpectedly high levels since 2004; consequently, and despite there continually being sufficient supply, this has led to dwindling levels of spare capacity; tightness in the downstream refining sector; and, speculative behaviour – indeed, open interests for crude oil on the NYMEX passed the one million contract mark for the first time in April. As it stands, this is approximately 1.2 billion barrels and over 14 times higher than the current daily oil output. A number of these factors will be addressed in more depth in this presentation.

Moreover, there has also been pressure on prices from both real and perceived uncertainties. For example, natural disasters, such as last year’s hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, geopolitical concerns, for instance, the recent ones in the Middle East, and other unexpected events like the recent partial closure of BP’s key Prudhoe oilfield in North America.

[Slide 4] There has obviously been a tendency to compare today’s situation with that of the 1970s, which has led to such questions as: have we entered a new price era? Whether or not we have entered a new price era remains to be seen, but what is interesting to note is that today – with a far more global marketplace, advances in IT and the increasing role of futures and options – price speculation is playing a much more prominent role.

At times over the past few years, day-to-day speculation has been an additional factor exacerbating price movement and often at a disconnect with market fundamentals. For example, the price of WTI crude rose on one single day this year by more than $4 and fell by more than $2 on a number of others. And over a period of a month from June 20 this year, oil climbed on most exchanges by more than $8 as tensions in the Middle East flared.

It is important that the issue of speculation – in what is termed the market for ‘paper-oil’ – is addressed in an effective manner, and soon, because speculation can lead to much price volatility and disruption within the market.

OPEC has been doing as much as it can to restore price stability at reasonable price levels, and other responsible parties have also responded to varying degrees and in accordance with circumstance and capabilities. All things considered, the Organization is not at ease with extreme price levels, whether too high or too low, as these are damaging to both producers and consumers. OPEC works towards increasing stability and enhancing predictability.

[Slide 5] What I would like to also pinpoint is that the recent price rises have fundamentally been demand-driven, a divergence from the supply-driven rises of the 1970s. With this in mind, it begs the question: just what are the changing dynamics of demand? Demand has been propelled in large parts by robust global economic growth, and in turn oil demand growth, with a particular focus on developing countries, such as China and India, alongside the continued and significant growth in the US. Indeed, world oil demand growth over the last four years has been almost 7 mb/d, higher than for any other four-year period in the past quarter of a century.

Furthermore, the volatility facing the oil industry has had analysts contemplating the possible price impact on the global economy as a whole, due to oil’s leading role in the world energy mix. Yet what has emerged in the last few years is that economic growth has remained fairly resilient. One key reason is that the world is now far more efficient in its use of oil. On top of this, rising wealth levels among the populations of industrialised countries, and the fact that any switch away from oil, where viable, has already taken place, further augments the reduced dependence between economic growth and price.

Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the issue of developing countries in this regard. World economic growth and strong commodity prices can be expected to support growth in most developing economies. Moreover, the growing interdependence through international trade is important for both regional and global economies, and in this regard, trade talks are central to ongoing growth prospects. However, much more can be done towards helping developing countries achieve growth and sustainable development. Here, I specifically refer to the critical Doha Round of WTO negotiations that have recently been suspended. A positive outcome to this trade-specific issue is essential for developing countries to progress in the global marketplace, particularly in agriculture. A failure of the Doha Development Round would undermine the multilateral trading system and could potentially lead to more protectionism.

[Slide 6] Allow me now to turn to supply and ask the same question: what are the changing dynamics of supply? Well, these include: the resource base debate; new technological developments that increase exploration success rates, enhance oil recovery and reduce costs; the relative future role of OPEC and non-OPEC supply; the changing, and in many instances, expanding role of National Oil Companies; increasing awareness of the need to protect the environment; the role of biofuels and other alternatives; tightness in the downstream sector; and, the rising project costs involving such issues as infrastructure and skilled labour. Let me explore a few of these dynamics in more detail.

[Slide 7] Firstly, with regard to the resource base, the question we often hear is: are the resources available to meet future demand? OPEC’s unequivocal response to this question is: yes. Estimates from the US Geological Survey of ultimately recoverable reserves have practically doubled since the early 1980s, from just 1,700 billion barrels to over 3,300 billion barrels. Energy supply will continue to rely primarily on fossil fuels in the coming decades and oil will remain the leading commercial energy source.

There is no physical shortage of the necessary conventional and non-conventional resources to meet demand. It is important that we as an industry persistently drive home this point. What should be underlined is that the issue is not about availability, it is about deliverability.

[Slide 8] In satisfying increases in demand, OPEC acknowledges the importance of taking advantage of technology and all forms of supply. In this regard, we acknowledge that alternative energy sources have a role to play in the global energy mix. We also consider that it is likely to be decades before any of these alternatives acquire a significant share of the global energy mix. For example, biofuels, which are currently receiving much attention, have to date, provided only one per cent of the world’s liquid transport fuels.

In many cases, however, governments have set ambitious targets for these alternative fuels, supported by expensive and unsustainable fiscal incentives, as well as often short-sighted policy initiatives. Moreover, the energy balance of biofuel production is debatable. In respect to biofuels, it is also important to appreciate that when large scale production of biofuels for export replaces local food production, especially in developing countries, the impact could mean significant increases in food prices, and possibly hunger and malnourishment. Is this compatible with the very first UN Millennium Development Goal that stresses the critical importance of reducing, by half, both the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger?.

[Slide 9] Where does this leave us? Well, with the need to acknowledge that in the meantime all other available energy sources must be accessed, enhanced and utilised to meet demand in both the developed and developing world. Oil, as the leading fuel in the global energy mix for the foreseeable future, is very much integral to this, and with this in mind, we recognise the importance of making sure fossil fuel use is consistent with environmental concerns. In fact, the oil industry has a long history of successfully improving the environmental credentials of oil, addressing concerns of local pollution and improving air quality.

Going forward there is a need to meet the challenges imposed by possible environmental concerns, whereby technological options that allow the continued use of fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained world must be considered. One promising option is carbon capture and storage (CCS), applied to large stationary sources of CO2 emissions, such as power stations and industrial sites, which together account for over half the energy-related CO2 emissions. CCS can also be used in conjunction with CO2-enhanced oil recovery, which offers a win-win opportunity by not only storing CO2, but also increasing oil reserves in mature fields.

Industrialised countries, having the financial and technological capabilities, should take the lead in this area, by promoting large-scale demonstration projects and the application of this technology, including through the use of the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), in accordance with the principle of common, but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. For its part, OPEC is demonstrating its commitment to the environment through its active participation in the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, and only next week, OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia, is hosting an EU-OPEC roundtable on CCS, as well as the First International Conference on the CDM.

[Slide 10] From the supply perspective, the downstream is also critical. Today, as I touched on earlier, current downstream tightness in the form of inadequate refining capacity is putting much pressure on oil prices generally. In addition to this, going forward there will be rising volumes of crude oil that need to be refined, as well as the expectation of a continued move towards demand for lighter and cleaner products. On top of this increasing need for further distillation and conversion capacity, it is estimated that additional desulphurisation capacity of more than 20 mb/d will also be required over the next 10 years.

It is estimated that $160 billion in downstream capacity investment will be required by 2015, with another $150 billion needed for maintenance and replacement of lost capacity. Yet such amounts are not forthcoming: there is an investment gap of something like $100 billion. What is required is a more concerted effort to ensure that sufficient capacities are in place. Most importantly, however, it needs to be recognised that even though OPEC Member Countries have taken the initiative to invest in downstream projects, the primary responsibility for investment in this sector lies with consuming countries.

[Slide 11] Returning to the entire energy value chain, another challenge, and one that is sometimes overlooked, is that of the cost of infrastructure, such as rigs and tankers, as well as the cost and availability of human resources. For example, upstream costs have increased by 50 per cent since 2003. This can be viewed in the fact that rig rates and the costs of steel and other raw materials are shifting significantly upwards.

In the area of human resources, the industry is experiencing a shortage of skilled labour for engineering, procurement, construction and operations and as a result wages have increased. During 2005 alone, wages in the industry increased by about 15 per cent. The number of students enrolling in petroleum engineering courses has also shown a significant decline since the mid-1980s. To alleviate the skilled manpower shortage, efforts should be made to help facilitate education and training in energy disciplines. We need to make the industry attractive to prospective graduates – this includes making it easier for students to enrol in universities across national borders – and employees the world over.

[Slide 12] Let me look to bring these threads of supply and demand together, by outlining how the OPEC Secretariat views the market going forward. For oil demand, our reference scenario anticipates a rise of 30 mb/d over the next 20 years, reaching 113 mb/d by 2025. This is under the assumption that no particular departure in trends for energy policies and technologies take place. From a supply perspective, in the medium term, total non-OPEC output has the potential to grow substantially; in the period 2005–10, our projections show 6 mb/d growth. In the longer term, however, it is expected that OPEC will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel. By 2025, OPEC production levels, including natural gas liquids, are anticipated to rise to 54 mb/d, but even then, non-OPEC countries will account for the larger part of world oil production.

[Slide 13] It all points to the need for vast amounts of investment, yet as we all know, investments do not materialise merely by a click of the fingers. Let me stress that from OPEC’s perspective the necessary investments are being made today. OPEC crude capacity expansion plans already in place are expected to result in almost 38 mb/d of crude capacity by the end of 2010, an increase of nearly 5 mb/d. The capacity growth is underpinned by more than 100 projects totaling $100 billion and these projects are in addition to energy infrastructure investments. All this is expected to further increase OPEC spare capacity over the next five years and is a further demonstration of OPEC’s continued commitment to oil market stability, and the seriousness it attaches to security of supply.

[Slide 14] Yet it is not just about investment today, it is investment tomorrow and every day thereafter. Doubts over future oil demand translate into large uncertainties over the amount that OPEC Member Countries will eventually need to supply, signifying a heavy burden of risk. It thus needs to be taken into account that the issue of security of demand must go hand-in-hand with security of supply. Both are of equal importance.

The importance of security of demand can be expressed very succinctly in figures. Over the next 15 years, for example, scenarios developed at the OPEC Secretariat suggest that the amount of oil required from OPEC could genuinely range by close to 10 mb/d. When talk turns to interpreting this in terms of investment, the figure takes on a very worrying look. The expected range is somewhere between $230 billion and $470 billion, a huge amount for OPEC Member Countries, all with competing needs in such areas as health, education and infrastructure. It should also be remembered that in the oil industry, investment requirements are very large and subject to long lead-times and pay-back periods.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

[Slide 15] Do the changing dynamics of price, supply and demand underline that we are entering a ‘new energy era’? At the moment it is difficult to say, but what is clear is that there are many new realities at play. From an OPEC perspective, we believe that the Organization is becoming better understood in its dedication to supporting market order and stability to meet the challenges of global energy security in the years ahead. Yet we also recognise that neither the public, or the private sector, or any one country, region nor organization can act alone.

OPEC very much believes that enhanced dialogue and cooperation gives us the best platform from which to collectively address current and future market challenges and opportunities. To this end OPEC continues to devote much effort in this direction, with dialogue now being widened and deepened in an open and constructive spirit. The most recent result of this was the establishment, last year, of energy dialogues between OPEC and, the EU, with the 3rd OPEC-EU Ministerial Meeting being held earlier this year, as well as with China, and Russia, and many other stakeholders.

In light of all this, OPEC is optimistic about the prospects for oil market stability in the coming years. The focus must be on understanding the needs of each stakeholder and viewing the entire energy market holistically. I believe we are striving to do this today and if we can meet the challenges and opportunities before us, it will be to the benefit of us all.

However, we should not forget that many people in this world continue to suffer from extreme poverty, with no access to modern energy services. As the global community seeks to change these bleak conditions it must be recognised that sustainable development must be based upon the three mutually supportive pillars of economic growth, social progress and environmental protection. The 15th Session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development, chaired by His Excellency Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiya, Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Energy & Industry of the State of Qatar, is therefore an extremely important opportunity to address these fundamental concerns.

[Slide 16] Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/292-12-september-2006.html"
"2006-09-12","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Welcome to the Third OPEC International Seminar, here at the Congress Centre of the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. This magnificent palace has strong associations with landmark events in European history over many centuries, and thus provides an ideal setting for an event that addresses the major challenge of providing mankind with energy.

The theme of the seminar is “OPEC in a New Energy Era: Challenges and Opportunities”. This theme has been chosen after careful deliberation, to reflect the fact that there have been fundamental changes to both the character and the dynamics of the world energy industry since the turn of the century, and that this may, in turn, affect the way the industry addresses the challenges that lie before it.

This has been especially apparent in the oil sector — OPEC’s principal field of activity — and, indeed, this trend has accelerated over the past two and a half years. The persistent price volatility during this period has been a symptom of this, and clearly this is not in the interest of any stakeholder in the industry, whether producer or consumer.

We shall, in fact, be assessing the extent to which this really is a new energy era. We shall also be cognizant of the fact that challenges, if mastered wisely, create new opportunities from which the world at large can — and should — benefit.

In the light of all this, perceptions about the true state of the industry have come under scrutiny, to the extent that analysts and decision-makers have been able to keep up with the changing tide of events — which has not always been easy. Thus, there has been greater intensity in their efforts to examine the way ahead, and this has resulted in some familiar perennial debates being pursued with renewed vigour in such key areas as energy security, global resources, the supply and demand balance, and price stability.

During this seminar, we shall be looking at these and many other topical issues that relate to the day-to-day running of the industry, as well as its orderly development in the years ahead.

At the same time, we shall accommodate broader-based issues affecting the harmonious evolution of mankind generally, such as the environment, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty, and how the provision of modern energy services meshes in with these. In OPEC, we attach a great deal of importance to this.

We shall benefit from the great strides that have been made in dialogue and cooperation since the late 20th century and which have supported the development of the industry as we know it today. Indeed, we expect such collaboration to continue in the future, fully utilising the latest advances in technology to ensure the continued steady supply of energy at reasonable prices to consumers the world over, in rich and poor nations alike.

In order to tackle this vast subject-matter, the seminar has been divided into six sessions: Global Energy Outlook — What are the Challenges Ahead?; Oil Production Capacity Expansion; Downstream Challenges and Opportunities; the Role of Petroleum Technology Advances; Petroleum and Sustainable Development; and the Role of OPEC in a New Energy Era.

We are privileged to have among us experts from across the international energy spectrum. They include Ministers from OPEC’s 11 Member Countries and other oil-producing and oil-consuming nations, top officials from intergovernmental bodies, chief executives of national and international oil companies, and renowned academics. We are deeply appreciative of their breaking away from their busy day-to-day schedules to participate in this seminar. At the same time, however, we are confident that, as well as benefiting us with their knowledge and experience, they themselves will gain from the wealth of expertise gathered together within the Congress Centre today.

We welcome full, free and frank exchanges in all our discussions, regardless of whether the expressed views are at variance with those of our Organization. It is only with an open, wholehearted approach that a meeting like this will be truly effective in enabling us to improve our knowledge and understanding.

On behalf of the participants, I should like to thank CWC Associates Ltd for organising the seminar, as well as the Staff Members of the OPEC Secretariat with whom they have worked closely over the past year. Similar appreciation is due to the sponsors, who have provided financial support and other assistance — Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, OPEC Fund for International Development, Pertamina, Qatar Petroleum, Saudi Aramco and Sonatrach.

We are also indebted to all the speakers, panellists and other participants, who have spent a great deal of time preparing for this event, and we eagerly await their contributions.

Finally, since I know that all of you are as keen as I am to proceed with the seminar, let me now declare it open.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/293-12-september-2006.html"
"2006-09-08","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for inviting me to Oxford to deliver this address on oil market stability and the role of OPEC.

Over the past three decades, the Oxford Energy Seminar has carved a niche for itself in the international energy community as a venue for high-level debate, in camera, on topical issues affecting the industry. Without exception, debate at this renowned seminar is fuelled by contributions from politicians, industrialists, academics and other experts of the highest standing and with vast reserves of knowledge and experience, and so I feel especially privileged to be invited to address such an accomplished gathering today.

Indeed, when we look at the present situation in the international oil market — with the high level of price volatility that has characterised it over the past two and a half years — then clearly such fora as this come into their element!

[Slide 2] On several occasions during this period, crude oil prices have reached record highs, and I am sure some seasoned market-watchers in this room are themselves wondering where and when prices will peak, or whether they have done so already.

Our predecessors had similar difficulties with crystal ball-gazing! A quarter of a century ago, some acclaimed international analysts were predicting crude oil prices of US $100 a barrel by the year 2000. Instead, prices collapsed below $10/b in the mid-1980s, less than half a decade later. Similar lows occurred a decade after that, in the wake of the economic downturn in south-east Asia. Even today’s record levels are well below three-quarters of the way towards the predicted $100/b mark!

We are, of course, referring to nominal prices here. In real terms, taking into account inflation and currency fluctuations, prices are still below levels reached in the early 1980s. It is important to be aware of this.

However, while record oil prices may capture the imagination of the public at large, it is, arguably, volatility that is of most concern to the industry.

If the goalposts are constantly shifting — not just from side to side, but also backwards and forwards, and perhaps even up and down! — then it becomes really difficult to both play the game today and to make rational decisions for tomorrow.

As is well known, the volatility, that still afflicts us today, was first widely perceived in the spring of 2004, and this followed several years of relatively high stability, very much encouraged by OPEC’s production agreements of the time.

[Slide 3] The initial reaction was that something strange is happening to the market. Is this just a temporary blip, and, if so, how temporary and how extensive? Or are more fundamental factors at play? If so, what are they and how deep-rooted are they? How long will it take the market to accommodate the new fundamentals and return to a workable equilibrium? At what price level and at what supply and demand level will this workable equilibrium be?

[Slide 4] How should producers — those that have the capability to increase production capacity — react to the new dynamics, in an industry where the upfront investment is large and the lead-times are long? Should they hold their breath a little longer to see how the situation transpires, should they take, so to speak, lightweight actions to tackle a short-term development, or should they adopt rather different measures to handle a more fundamental, longer-term phenomenon? In pondering thus, we must remember that these producers face a huge burden of risk in investing heavily in capacity that may not be needed.

Such issues as these faced OPEC’s Oil Ministers when they met in Vienna on 31 March 2004. To add irony to the situation, this was happening at a time when the market appeared to be well-supplied with crude and the market was moving into the traditional lower-demand season of the year.

Furthermore, we must be cautious here in Oxford today about making judgements with the benefit of hindsight. Our closing press release in March 2004 stated that the “high oil price levels remain predominantly a consequence of long positions of market speculators in the futures markets coupled with a tightening in the US gasoline market in some regions, and exacerbated by uncertainties arising from prevailing geopolitical concerns rather than purely a reflection of supply/demand fundamentals.” It added that “structural problems and bottlenecks (were) affecting the downstream oil industry, which have been contributing to recent price movements.”

We can see here that there have been some shifts in emphasis in analysis carried out since that time about the causes of the volatility in early 2004. For example, more weight has since been placed on the impact of tightness in the downstream sector in consuming countries, which has been very much due to a lack of timely investment and increasingly stringent product regulations. Interestingly, it has emerged that, during the past two and a half years, downstream price volatility has been having a “pull” effect on upstream price volatility, rather than the more usual reciprocal “push” effect of the upstream on the downstream, as one would expect from classical economic analysis.

[Slide 5] Also, subsequent analysis has highlighted the big effect of the unexpectedly high levels of oil demand from the rapidly growing emerging economies in Asia, especially China and India, as well as from the North America. In 2004, global oil demand surged by 3.0 million barrels a day, a level of demand growth not seen since the 1970s.

[Slide 6] Furthermore, the volatility facing the oil industry in spring 2004 had analysts contemplating on its possible impact on the global economy as a whole, due to oil’s leading role in the world energy mix. There was the obvious tendency to compare the rapidly developing situation with that of the 1970s. Subsequent analysis, however, has exposed major differences to three decades ago, with a greatly reduced impact on world economic growth and oil demand. Reasons include much lower oil intensities in consuming countries, higher taxation levels, greater efficiency, a more diverse energy mix and the fact that the transportation sector, with its low price elasticity, now has a much larger share of the international oil market. Fundamentally, the present situation is essentially demand-driven, resulting from the strong economic growth, rather than supply-driven, as was the case in the 1970s.

All of this emphatically underlines the benefit of stability to the oil market and further afield across the global economy, covering all foreseeable time-horizons. Stability begets stability. If stability could be achieved and sustained in its purest, most universal form, then it would clearly be a “win-win” situation for all the responsible parties in the oil industry. But stability must be worked on by those parties for the short, the medium and the long terms.

In addition to this, stability provides another very important benefit to OPEC Member States and other oil-producing countries, particularly those from the developing world, where petroleum export revenue can account for a very large proportion of total export revenue — about 73 per cent, on average, for OPEC in 2005. The revenue oil-producing developing countries receive from oil sales is essential for financing their economic and social development programmes, to an extent that may not be fully appreciated by industrialised nations. This is in addition to the part that must be reinvested in the upstream to meet rising demand. It is, therefore, in the best interests of these producing countries to ensure that every possible measure is taken to support market stability at all times, so that the optimal benefit can be derived from their finite oil resources and shared among present and future generations.

[Slide 7] This explains why OPEC is so committed to achieving and maintaining market stability, a commitment that goes back to its inaugural meeting in Baghdad in September 1960. OPEC’s very first resolution stated that “Members shall study and formulate a system to ensure the stabilization of prices.” [Slide 8] Several months later, this commitment was enshrined in the OPEC Statute, when it was first adopted in January 1961, and it has remained a key guiding principle of the Organization ever since: “The Organization shall devise ways and means of ensuring the stabilisation of prices in international oil markets, with a view to eliminating harmful and unnecessary fluctuations.”

It has been reaffirmed repeatedly in OPEC documentation over the years, notably in OPEC’s two Solemn Declarations, which concluded summits of Member Countries’ Heads of State and Government in 1975 and 2000, and, most recently, the Long-Term Strategy (LTS) OPEC adopted exactly one year ago. Indeed, the LTS is unequivocal in its views about oil price volatility, saying that this “renders all the more difficult the interpretation of price signals, whether they are an indication of structural change or a reflection of temporary phenomena, and thereby affecting the ability to support longer-term market stability.”

The LTS also emphasises the importance of fair prices, the security of regular supply to consumers and the security of world oil demand. This again elaborates upon the OPEC Statute: “Due regard shall be given at all times to the interests of the producing nations and to the necessity of securing: a steady income to the producing countries; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry.”

[Slide 9] It also brings us onto the important issue of energy security, which is closely linked to market stability and has gained greater prominence on the international political agenda over the past year or so, in the wake of the recent market volatility. Energy security provided the central theme of the Tenth International Energy Forum (IEF) in Doha in April, it features prominently in the European Union’s Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, and it headed the agenda at the recent G8 Summit in St Petersburg.

Indeed, in the build-up to July’s summit in St Petersburg, there was an International Conference on Energy Security in Moscow in March, followed immediately by a G8 Energy Ministerial Meeting. In OPEC’s official statement to the Ministerial Meeting, we made the point that “the concept of ‘global energy security’ is so fundamental to life in the 21st century that every effort must be made to clarify its meaning, to gain a consensus on this and to ensure that its true principles are embodied in decision-making processes across the energy sector by at least the major players.”

We welcomed the broader-based approach by consuming countries to energy security — as opposed to merely supply security — that emerged in St Petersburg. At the end of the summit, the Chair stated: “We agreed that dynamic and sustainable development of our civilization depends on reliable access to energy. It is best assured by strengthened partnership between energy-producing and consuming countries, including enhanced dialogue on growing energy interdependence, security of supply and demand issues.”

The issue of security of demand is very important to OPEC and other producing countries. Security of demand must go hand-in-hand with security of supply as a means of achieving market stability, since, without the confidence that predictable, reliable demand for oil will emerge, the incentive to undertake the necessary investments can be significantly reduced.

Nevertheless, in spite of these positive developments at the G8 Summit, we feel, in OPEC, that more confidence could have been expressed by the participants at large about the willingness and the ability of oil-producing developing countries to service the growing world energy requirement in the years ahead.

So far, I have endeavoured to explain the importance of stability to the international oil market and the world economy at large, as well as OPEC’s unyielding commitment to achieving and sustaining market stability and security, from which all responsible parties can benefit. Let us now look at how OPEC goes about meeting this commitment.

A good place to start is with the present market volatility, which, as I have already remarked, has persisted for around two and a half years. I earlier tried to illustrate the mindset of OPEC’s Oil Ministers as the new situation began to unravel in spring 2004, referring to the OPEC Conference of March that year.

Let us now move onto OPEC’s next meeting — of 3 June 2004 in Lebanon — noting that, first of all, this was an Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference, rather than one of the Organization’s twice-yearly scheduled Ordinary Meetings, which are usually held in March and September.

[Slide 10] There are several significant points about the closing press release to this meeting. First of all, it contains a qualitative judgement about the market situation, with the text “the Conference noted with concern”. Then there is a reference to reviewing market developments since OPEC’s previous meeting. Next, there is an expression of “OPEC’s commitment to market stability and to maintaining prices at acceptable levels to both producers and consumers.” There is a decision for action, in this case with a two-phase increase in OPEC’s production ceiling in the following two months “to ensure adequate supply,” as well as the convening of another Extraordinary Conference in Vienna seven weeks later “to review market developments”. And finally, there is a call on “all other parties, including non-OPEC producers and consumers, to take appropriate measures to address the challenges facing the industry, including the structural changes.”

This is typical of OPEC’s multifaceted response to market developments of any shape or form and at any time, and examples of this are rife over the decades. It was apparent once again, for example, at the most recent Meeting of the OPEC Conference — in Caracas, Venezuela, on 1 June this year — when “the Conference reaffirmed its determination to ensure that crude oil prices remain at acceptable levels.”

Let me make it clear to this distinguished assembly that OPEC is not comfortable with the present high oil prices. If prices are too high — or, indeed, too low — they are not sustainable and contain within them the seeds of volatility. OPEC has been trying to moderate oil prices, even though our Organization’s influence is limited because the high levels have been due principally to factors beyond its control. In fact, the market has remained well-supplied with crude throughout the present difficult period.

Decisions taken at OPEC Conferences are backed-up by actions from its Member Countries in the ensuing months and beyond. But it must be pointed out here that market developments themselves can change very rapidly, sometimes overnight. Indeed, the very fact that OPEC has taken a particular decision may affect the market in such a way that the grounds for that decision may shift very quickly and affect the most appropriate response OPEC would have to subsequently achieving market stability.

The net result of OPEC’s decisions during the present volatile period is that our Member Countries have increased production by around 4.5 mb/d since 2002. As a result, there have been no actual supply shortages; indeed, recently, stocks have increased to levels above their five-year average in the OECD, particularly in the USA. And, where possible, our Member Countries have accelerated their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and re-establish a comfortable cushion of spare capacity.

Even though we have had little influence over recent destabilising factors, we believe that the very fact that we are taking such measures sends a strong signal to the market about OPEC’s views on a particular set of events, and that this, in itself, can have a stabilising effect on market sentiment. For example, last year, OPEC’s assurances of healthy supply, accompanied by similar positive expressions from the International Energy Agency, helped prevent the output disruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita from developing into a major crisis. Over the past couple of months, OPEC has quickly taken the initiative in providing assurances about adequate crude supplies, after the outbreak of hostilities in the Lebanon region and again after the partial closure of the Prudhoe Bay oilfield in Alaska.

[Slide 11] The result of all this is that, with OPEC’s upstream capacity on course to rise to around 33 mb/d by the end of the year, against an expected average output of 29.1 mb/d for the year, our spare capacity should be at levels that are comfortable for the market. OPEC’s policy has, indeed, ensured that the trend of ample production and sufficient spare capacity will continue for years to come, benefiting producers and consumers alike and enhancing stability.

Furthermore, our Member Countries, although traditionally associated with the upstream, have also increased investment in downstream projects, on their own and in partnership with others. Present estimates show that this will result in at least 2.5 mb/d of additional refinery capacity by 2010, with more being considered. [Slide 12] However, this does not escape the fact that downstream investment is primarily the responsibility of consuming countries, and the indications are that this sector could remain a key source of price volatility for some time to come, with expansion lagging behind demand growth.

[Slide 13] This brings me onto another very important point. It is clear from all of this that OPEC has been doing as much as it can to restore price stability at levels acceptable to the market at large. Other responsible parties have also responded to varying degrees and in accordance with circumstance and capabilities. However, there are some areas where much more needs to be done, and paramount among these is speculation, which has, at times since spring 2004, inflated prices far above fundamental levels, as intuitively surmised by the consensus view among analysts at any one time during this period. Appropriate and sustainable remedial action can — and should, where applicable — involve parties far removed from the day-to-day affairs of the energy industry. But it is absolutely essential that this issue is addressed effectively soon, because speculation is causing so much price volatility and disruption within the market that it is having a serious knock-on effect in areas far removed from the industry itself.

Returning to OPEC’s self-assigned role with regard to market stability, the Organization sees this as not being confined to the present. Equally importantly, it also attends to future needs in an anticipatory manner.

Since the 1980s, OPEC has used its own World Energy Model to construct scenarios depicting possible paths of market evolution extending up to two decades or more ahead, as part of the extensive research activities that take place at its Secretariat in Vienna, Austria. The purpose of this has been to support its Member Countries in handling the many and varied challenges and opportunities they face in the industry.

OPEC shares the view of most analysts that, over the next 20 years, world energy supply will continue to rely primarily on fossil fuels, with oil retaining its leading position, which our latest projections put at close to 40 per cent during this period.

[Slide 14] A reference case scenario forecasts a 30 million barrel a day rise in demand by 2025, to reach 113 mb/d, constituting an annual average increase of 1.5 mb/d. This assumes, among other things, no dramatic changes in energy and environmental policies in consuming countries. The transportation sector will be the main source of future oil demand growth, while developing countries, especially from Asia, are set to account for four-fifths of the rise, with consumption almost doubling to 53 mb/d. However, in 2025, OECD countries will remain the dominant oil consumer and will continue to use, on average, five times more oil per person than developing countries.

[Slide 15] As is widely recognised by knowledgeable and reputable organisations, the global resource base is sufficient to deal with the forecast increases in world oil demand. Estimates of global ultimately recoverable resources for conventional oil have been increasing, due to such factors as technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery from existing fields. In addition, there is a vast resource base of non-conventional oil to develop.

[Slide 16] In the medium term, non-OPEC supply has the potential to rise substantially, with growth projected at 6 mb/d in the present period of 2005–10. However, this is eventually expected to reach a plateau after 2015, at 58–59 mb/d.

In the longer term, therefore, it is expected that OPEC, with nearly four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel of demand. Hence most of the new demand will be met by non-OPEC in the short-to-medium term and by OPEC in the longer term. Our projections in this reference case show that OPEC production levels, including natural gas liquids, would rise to 54 mb/d by 2025, which would be slightly below that of non-OPEC.

[Slide 17] OPEC’s willingness and ability to supply the incremental barrel demonstrates the seriousness it attaches to oil stability and security. However, this is by no means a smooth path. For example, uncertainties over future levels of oil demand translate into a wide range of possible levels of necessary investment in OPEC Member Countries. These are caused, in particular, by uncertainties over world economic growth, advances in technology and policy measures in consuming countries. Even over the medium term to 2010, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment, and this increases to as much as $240 bn by 2020. Thus there is a heavy burden of risk for these countries, with the huge amounts of capital that must be committed up front.

This is why OPEC repeatedly calls for more transparency in the evolution and implementation of policies among consuming countries, so that better assessments can be made to undertake the appropriate capacity expansions and prevent waste of precious financial resources.

All in all, in strict market terms, stability has many dimensions to it, and OPEC sees its role as trying to accommodate these as much as possible.

[Slide 18] But there is more to it than just quantities. There is also the qualitative aspect, addressing the growing need for energy services to integrate better with the broader-based challenges facing mankind, in rich and poor nations alike.

To begin with, there is the issue of the environment. The oil industry has a long history of successfully improving the environmental credentials of oil, addressing concerns of local pollution and improving air quality, and OPEC’s Member Countries have been at the forefront of many exciting new developments over the years. But there is also the need to meet the challenges imposed by possible climate change, where technological options that allow the continued use of oil and gas in a carbon-constrained world must be considered.

One promising example is carbon capture and storage (CCS), applied to large stationary sources of CO2 emissions, such as power stations and industrial sites, which account for over half the energy-related CO2 emissions. CCS can also be used in conjunction with CO2 enhanced oil recovery, which offers a win-win opportunity by not only storing CO2, but also increasing oil reserves in mature fields. If CCS is to be used on a scale that would make a significant impact upon net CO2 emissions, it could develop into a significant business opportunity for the oil industry. However, we also believe that the developed countries should take the lead in the area of providing cleaner oil and gas technologies by promoting large-scale demonstration projects, including the use of the clean development mechanism (CDM) in accordance with the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” and respective capabilities.

Clean and safe energy is also a vital requirement for developing countries as they seek access to modern energy services in their often protracted struggle for socio-economic development, sometimes from a state of extreme poverty. Without outside assistance, many appear to have no means of escape from the poverty trap. We are constantly mindful of the fact that poverty eradication is the first UN Millennium Development Goal, and a comprehensive and balanced approach to implementing the three pillars of sustainable development — economic development, social development and environmental protection — is required. Energy security applies to all nations of the world, and the eradication of energy poverty demands urgent attention.

In order to prosper and to benefit mankind generally, these qualitative aspects require as much stability as possible in the world energy market, and this has provided a powerful additional incentive for our Member Countries to work towards this fundamental objective — oil market stability — which, as I noted earlier, was adopted at the very first Meeting of the OPEC Conference 46 years ago, was enshrined in the OPEC Statute shortly after, and has served as one of our guiding principles ever since.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

In the light of all this, OPEC is optimistic about the prospects for oil market stability in the coming years. But this optimism can only find its full expression through the widespread, practised commitment from the industry as a whole to its achievement and maintenance.

This is why we welcome so much the advances that have been made in dialogue and cooperation in recent years, involving the major players from all sides of the industry, and the steadily increasing institutionalisation of such processes. I have already referred to the IEF, and this specialist ministerial-level producer-consumer body, with its headquarters in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia, is a prime example of this. The establishment last year of three formal energy dialogues between OPEC and, respectively, the European Union, China and Russia, is another important example, and these have already begun to provide a much clearer understanding of the respective views of the all the parties involved, as well as setting up proposals to jointly examine in depth topical issues of mutual interest.

[Slide 19] Dialogue and cooperation should exist at every level of the industry and in associated areas, such as academia, if it is to be truly effective. The stakes are very high and, as I have endeavoured to make clear throughout this address, we all stand to benefit from sustained stability in this leading sector of the global economy.

[Slide 20] Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/294-08-september-2006.html"
"2006-08-27","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to begin by thanking His Excellency Dr Dimitrij Rupel, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia, for inviting me to participate in this panel discussion, part of the ‘Caspian Outlook 2008’ conference. The Caspian has for many centuries played an important role in the development of the international oil industry – Marco Polo witnessed the mining of seep oil in the region on his travels in the 13th century and the first modern oil well was drilled close to Baku in the 19th century. The high quality panel I am part of today very much underlines the continued influence of the region.

I find it encouraging to read from the conference correspondence that the newly established Bled Strategic Forum is “conceptualised as a forum for promoting high-level strategic dialogue between leaders … on key issues — regional and thematic — with which Europe of the 21st century will be confronted,” and to tie this in with the accompanying statement of intent that this “event will contribute to the preparation of the Slovenian EU Presidency in the first half of 2008.”

OPEC has long maintained that a sound, sustained, committed and multilateral process of dialogue is indispensable to the future healthy evolution of the world energy sector. We have supported this belief with our actions over many years.

This is typified by the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue. The establishment of this began in December 2004, with the first dialogue taking place in June last year. It is already producing tangible results, with a much clearer understanding of each other’s views on many important issues, including energy security, and planned joint actions to improve our knowledge of such topics as energy policies and financial markets. The two sides are also developing a proposal to establish an EU-OPEC energy technology centre.

OPEC has recently set up similar energy dialogues with Russia, which is, of course, a significant player in the Caspian region, and with China, which is increasing its investment there. Again, both energy dialogues are broadening mutual understanding and are spawning further collaborative actions.

Energy security has been identified as one of the priorities of the future Slovenian Presidency and, as the conference correspondence states, “energy security will increasingly dominate the global policy agenda.” In fact, it is already playing an increasingly significant role. Energy security provided the central theme of the 10th International Energy Forum (IEF) in Doha in April, a forum in which OPEC has played a leading role, it features prominently in the EU Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, and it headed the agenda at the recent G8 Summit in St Petersburg. The heavy emphasis on energy security — the theme of this panel — comes as no surprise in the wake of the prevailing market volatility.

This volatility can be viewed in the well documented significant rise in oil prices over the past three years, with the increase influenced by a convergence of factors: exceptionally strong economic growth over the past few years, and, in turn, oil demand growth, with a global increase of 5.4 million barrels a day (mb/d) over the three years to 2005; a slowdown in the expansion of non-OPEC supply; a shortage of spare capacity; tightness in the downstream refining sector, where utilisation rates have exceeded 90 per cent in most regions, which in turn can lead to product shortages if disruptions arise; speculative behaviour – indeed, contract volumes for crude oil on the NYMEX have almost doubled since 2003 and there has been phenomenal growth in hedge and pension funds; as well as additional issues such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year, the recent partial closure of BP's key Prudhoe oilfield in North America and concerns around geopolitical tensions.

What I would like to emphasise is that OPEC is a little uneasy with prices at the present high levels, because as the varied influences suggest, there is much ongoing volatility, the levels are not entirely supported by oil market fundamentals and the influences also contain within them the seeds of further volatility. Extreme price levels, whether too high or too low are detrimental to both producers and consumers.

All this points to the need for a broader-based approach by consumers to energy security — as opposed to merely supply security — and this emerged at the G8 Summit. We obviously welcome this. At the end of the Summit, the Chair stated: “We agreed that dynamic and sustainable development of our civilization depends on reliable access to energy. It is best assured by strengthened partnership between energy producing and consuming countries, including enhanced dialogue on growing energy interdependence, security of supply and demand issues.” The issue of security of demand is very important to OPEC and other producing countries, and we recognise the achievement of the host nation, Russia, in bringing this to the fore.

But, at the same time, we feel that more confidence could have been expressed by the participants at large about the willingness and the ability of oil-producing developing countries to service the growing world energy requirement in the years ahead.

For reasons that are clear to all of us on this panel, the oil industry is, and always has been, a challenging environment in which to operate. The successful functioning of the global economy is heavily dependent upon oil, and so the stakes are always very high.

OPEC has demonstrated repeatedly its commitment to market order and stability, even though, in practice, this can often be very hard to achieve, as the experiences of the past couple of years have shown. Nevertheless, even though we have little influence over the present situation, since the market remains well-supplied with crude and other factors are responsible for the volatility, we persevere with our efforts to achieve stability, with secure and regular supplies of oil.

Yet it must be recognised that security of supply must go hand-in-hand with security of demand as a means to achieve market stability, as without the confidence that demand for oil will emerge, the incentive to undertake the necessary investments can be reduced. In the oil industry, investment requirements are very large and subject to long lead-times and payback periods. Scenarios developed by the OPEC Secretariat highlight that even over the medium-term, out to 2015, uncertainties over future oil demand translate into an investment uncertainty of around $140 billion.

To illustrate OPEC’s commitment to market stability and energy security, let me highlight our Member Countries recent actions that have led to an increase in production of around 4.5 mb/d since 2002. OPEC’s Members upstream capacity is on course to be around 33.3 mb/d by the end of the year, as against 30 mb/d in 2003. Placed alongside an expected OPEC output of 28.1 mb/d in 2007, the Organization’s level of spare capacity will exceed 10 per cent, which should help to moderate prices. Though it should be noted this represents a significant cost to Member Countries. Going forward capacity growth is underpinned by more than 100 projects totalling $100 billion. Moreover, these projects are in addition to energy infrastructure investments.

On top of this, and in response to the bottlenecks in consumer products markets that have been having such a big impact on oil prices, our Members have also increased capacity and investment downstream, on their own and in partnership with others. Present estimates show that this will result in, at least, 2.5 mb/d of additional refinery capacity by 2010. We therefore believe that OPEC should receive more recognition from consumers for our active commitment to energy security.

Notwithstanding this, we are acutely aware of the growing world energy requirement, OPEC Secretariat research highlights that oil demand is expected to increase by 1.3 mb/d in 2006, and the fact that every effort must be made — on a broad front and in a realistic manner — to service this in the years ahead. This is both to meet the needs of established consumer societies and to contribute meaningfully to the sustainable development of less-advanced economies and the eradication of the dire poverty that afflicts many nations of the world. It needs to be remembered that for many developing nations, poverty and the associated energy poverty, are the key components of energy security. We should never forget that 1.1 billion people are currently living on less than $1 a day, 1.6 billion people in developing countries currently lack access to modern energy services and almost 2 billion have no electricity.

Clearly the Caspian basin, with its abundant oil and gas resources, has an important role to play in this process. In fact the Caspian nations of Kazakhstan, which has OPEC observer status, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, are expected to see significant production growth rates out to 2011; from around 2.2 mb/d in 2006 to more than 3.5 mb/d in 2011. Today, the region’s growth is no longer constricted by a lack of pipelines. For example, the single biggest route from the Caspian thus far, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline with a capacity of 1 mb/d, started operation in May this year. Accordingly, we can well understand the interest the EU shows in the region, as well as the benefits this development and regional cooperation brings to the countries of the Caspian basin.

At OPEC, we believe and should like to see contributions from the Caspian and other regions being considered as complementary to OPEC’s contribution, rather than in some way substituting for it. As such, we welcome initiatives to enhance dialogue between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, as well as consumers.

Finally, turning to the longer term, I would like to underline that OPEC’s strong resource base, with nearly four-fifths of current proven world crude oil reserves and nearly half its natural gas, assures it of a capability to service the global energy requirement well into the 21st century to match its enduring commitment to the task of market stability and energy security.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/295-27-august-2006.html"
"2006-07-27","Ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to address you this evening on the subject of “Energy security: a global perspective”.

My opening remarks, understandably, will be a little different to what they would have been, had I delivered this address at the beginning of this month, due to the rapidly unfolding developments of the past fortnight in the Middle East and the accompanying tragic loss of life, property and economic and social infrastructure.

There were two immediate effects of this turn of events on the international oil market, and they are connected to each other.

First, oil prices reached new record levels in nominal terms, with OPEC’s Reference Basket quickly gaining around US $3 a barrel — rising from $68.66/b on 12 July, when the crisis began, to a peak of $71.71/b two days later. Subsequently, however, they slipped back from this level, averaging $68.71/b on Tuesday this week.

And secondly, there was enhanced concern among consumers about security of supply from the Middle East. This was in spite of the fact that no oil producers are currently involved in the conflict and there has been plenty of crude on the market throughout. Figures released yesterday by the US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration confirm this, with commercial crude stocks well above last year’s level, at nearly 336 million barrels.

And, on top of this, OPEC quickly reassured the market about its unwavering commitment to security of supply. Furthermore, there was an irony here, since the new situation arose just before the issue of global energy security was to top the agenda at the forthcoming G8 summit in St Petersburg, which went on to address it.

And there are a couple of other points of significance. First, the events were unexpected in the world at large, certainly in terms of timing and intensity, and therefore, like other economic sectors, the oil market was taken completely by surprise. And secondly, they coincided with the start of the summer driving season in the Northern Hemisphere, a factor which, by itself, can lead to tightness in the products market — even though the market has, of course, been preparing for this in the usual manner and the upstream sector is well-supplied with crude, as I mentioned a moment ago, with stocks above their five-year average in the OECD, currently providing 54 days of forward demand cover.

Finally, this has all been happening against the backdrop of the volatility and rising prices which have dominated market affairs since spring 2004. We are, of course, familiar with the issues here and the effects of an unusual convergence of factors.

To begin with, there was the exceptionally strong world economic growth — at 5.2 per cent per annum in 2004 and 4.7 per cent in 2005, this was well above long-term trend levels. In turn, there was robust oil demand growth, especially in developing countries. Global oil demand surged by 3.0 million barrels a day in 2004 alone — a level of growth not seen since the early 1970s. This moderated somewhat last year, with demand increasing by just under 1 mb/d, although the level has risen again slightly since then.

There was also a significant slowdown in the rate of expansion of non-OPEC supply in 2004 and 2005, and this followed many years of non-OPEC supply growth exceeding that of OPEC, and often at faster-than-predicted rates. However, the rate has picked up again and average non-OPEC supply is expected to rise by 1.2 mb/d this year.

Furthermore, there has been tightness in the downstream sector, which has been putting pressure on not just product prices, but also crude prices. Factors behind this include a lack of timely investment in the downstream sector and increasingly stringent product regulations motivated by environmental concerns.

Also influencing price movements has been increased activity in the futures market, with a new inflow of capital movements by hedge and pension funds. Indeed, open interest contracts in the NYMEX passed the one million mark for the first time in April, with volumes almost doubling since 2003 — this is more than ten times the total oil supply in the world physical market at the present time. Moreover, there have been natural disasters and uncertainties stemming from geopolitical developments.

Thus the sudden, unexpected turn of events in the Middle East has accentuated an already difficult situation in the market. But, at the same time, it has added to OPEC’s resolve to alleviate the continued volatility and upward pressure on prices in a timely and effective manner.

Nevertheless, these events have done little to change the underlying, longer-term realities facing the market, including perceptions about energy security, the theme of this address.

Indeed, we have been heartened by some positive developments on this theme that came out of the St Petersburg summit. As the BBC put it, in a report on its website: “The point of putting energy security top of the agenda was to require the Western world to examine the problem not just from their own viewpoint as energy consumers, but consider also the needs and concerns of those who produce the stuff and transport it”.

We consider this point to be very important. In fact, it echoed the sentiment expressed in the third Ministerial-level meeting of the European Union-OPEC Energy Dialogue in Brussels last month.

Looking at the Chair’s summary of the section on global energy security, which refers to the adoption by the summit of the “St.Petersburg Plan of Action to enhance global energy security”, we welcome the opening remarks: “We … set out our common goals and approaches aimed at ensuring sufficient, reliable and environmentally responsible supplies of energy at prices reflecting market fundamentals.”

We also note the statement that the “dynamic and sustainable development of our civilization depends on reliable access to energy,” and that this “is best assured by strengthened partnership between energy producing and consuming countries, including enhanced dialogue on growing energy interdependence, security of supply and demand issues.” We further concur strongly with the subsequent reference to the need to reduce energy poverty in developing countries.

The Plan of Action picks up on a point that OPEC has been emphasising for a long time, namely the importance of minimising uncertainty to improve transparency over energy market developments, and thus contribute to sound investment decisions and competitiveness. It goes on to state that “regular exchanges of timely and reliable information among all market participants are also essential for the smooth functioning of world energy markets,” and refers specifically to the roles of the International Energy Forum (IEF) and the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI). OPEC has played a big part in the development of the ministerial-level producer-consumer body, the IEF, and is one of the six international organizations that set up JODI, whose activities are supervised by the Forum.

All of this indicates a shift away from longstanding narrow, self-interested views of energy security to a greater appreciation of its broader, more universal nature. A more integrated global energy industry is partly responsible for this, with many traditional lines of demarcation between functions and between functionaries becoming increasingly blurred.

However, it also owes a lot to the big advances in dialogue and cooperation in recent years, in recognition of the fact that, if we all want a more stable and better-performing market now and in the future, then we all have a responsibility to try to bring this about.

OPEC itself entered into formal Energy Dialogues with three large regions last year — the European Union, China and Russia — and there are several significant observations from this. First, there has been the eagerness and readiness of the respective parties to engage in meaningful dialogue. Secondly, there is already a much clearer understanding of the respective views of the parties on many important energy issues, including energy security. And thirdly, the dialogues are already producing tangible results. For example, with the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue, which was the first out of the blocks, about half a year before the others, joint actions have been agreed upon — and, in most cases, schedules set — for in-depth studies on carbon capture and storage, energy policies, refining sector investment needs and financial speculative markets; the two sides are also developing a proposal to establish an EU-OPEC energy technology centre. There has already been a joint round table on oil market developments and future prospects.

In addition to this, as the issue of energy security has gained greater prominence on the international political agenda over the past year or so, in the wake of the recent market volatility, high-level discussions on the topic have taken place on several notable occasions. “Energy security, a shared responsibility” provided the central theme of the Tenth International Energy Forum in Doha three months ago. The issue features prominently in the EU Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, which was published a month earlier. Energy security was mentioned at the US-EU Summit in Vienna last month. And, in the build-up to this month’s Summit in St Petersburg, there was an International Conference on Energy Security in Moscow in March, followed immediately by a G8 Energy Ministerial Meeting.

In OPEC’s official statement to the G8 Ministerial Meeting, we made the point that “the concept of ‘global energy security’ is so fundamental to life in the 21st century that every effort must be made to clarify its meaning, to gain a consensus on this and to ensure that its true principles are embodied in decision-making processes across the energy sector by at least the major players.” We also said that global energy security has many dimensions and that they include the following.

It should be universal, applying to rich and poor nations alike. In particular, it should seek to honour the spirit of Johannesburg 2002, the UN World Summit on Sustainable Development.

It should be reciprocal. Security of demand is as important to producers as security of supply is to consumers.

It should apply to all energy sources in a manner that is free from prejudicial regulatory and legislative measures, such as the very high levels of taxation imposed on oil products in many consuming countries, in contrast with low taxation, no taxation or even subsidies in other energy sectors.

It should apply to the entire supply chain. Downstream is as crucial as upstream, as we have seen recently, and refinery bottlenecks can have a major impact on steady, secure supplies to the consumer.

It should cover all foreseeable time-horizons. Security tomorrow is as important as security today, and provision must be made for this at all times through sound investment strategies. In recent years, we have seen how concern over security of future supply can significantly impact today's prices.

It should focus on providing all consumers — rich and poor — with the most modern energy products, meeting the highest environmental standards and benefiting from the application of the latest technology.

And it should be openly receptive to dialogue and cooperation among the leading players in the market, to facilitate the market’s sound evolution in a balanced and equitable manner both now and in the future.

As you know, of course, some of what we stated then can be found in the St Petersburg proceedings, in full or in part, to the letter or in the spirit.

Nevertheless, I should like to elaborate upon one or two of the points I have just made, because they impinge upon OPEC’s ability to provide consumers with the crude supply they require in a timely and sufficient manner, and I feel that they are still not well-enough understood by many consumers.

I am referring, in particular, to the reciprocal nature of energy security, and wish to stress that this is important not just for producers, but also for the industry as a whole. Security of supply and security of demand are mutually supportive.

If our Member Countries — which collectively possess the majority of the world’s proven crude oil reserves — are to provide the necessary production capacity as required in the years ahead, in an industry where huge upfront investment is required and the lead-times are long, they obviously need to have as clear a vision as possible of future demand potential. Uncertainty over future demand translates into large uncertainties over the amount of oil that Member Countries will eventually need to supply, signifying a huge burden of risk. Even over the medium term to 2010, OPEC’s projections, based on alternative feasible scenarios, show an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment, increasing to $140 bn by 2015 and as much as $240 bn by 2020.

There is, of course, only so much one can do to predict future economic trends and advances in technology. However, what can prove of immeasurable benefit to investors in the oil industry are more transparency and predictability with economic, energy and environmental policies in consuming countries, since the impact of these on oil demand can be so large that they can severely compromise existing, carefully drawn-up, heavily financed investment schemes in new production capacity. All parties, let me remind you, benefit from the provision of production capacity that is timely and sufficient. The market can be in a sorry state if this does not arise. Everyone in the industry has suffered heavily at one time or another, in this respect. The issue of security of demand, therefore, is a very genuine one for oil-producing developing countries and for the world at large.

Let me look at another issue that crops up in discussions about energy security and also featured in St Petersburg — renewables. We agree that these constitute an important option that needs to be developed at every opportunity. However, in reality, there are still many hurdles to overcome, and it is likely to be decades before renewables acquire a significant share of the world energy mix. Currently, they account for around 11 per cent of the total world energy mix, excluding hydro, and are expected to retain this proportion up to 2025, despite an increase in absolute terms.

Therefore, with due attention to environmental concerns, all other available energy sources must be accessed, enhanced and utilised in the meantime to tackle the dire problems of mankind and support sustainable development.

OPEC shares the view of most analysts that energy supply will continue to rely primarily on fossil fuels in the coming decades and that oil will remain the leading commercial energy source. We see oil accounting for close to 40 per cent of energy demand over the next two decades.

Advances in technology continue to make oil a cleaner, safer and even more desirable fuel. Indeed, the oil industry has a long history of successfully improving the environmental credentials of oil, addressing concerns of local pollution and improving air quality. Our Member Countries are committed to this.

Furthermore, there is the need to meet the challenges imposed by possible climate change, where technological options that allow the continued use of oil and gas in a carbon-constrained world must be considered. One promising example is carbon capture and storage (CCS), applied to large stationary sources of CO2 emissions, such as power stations and industrial sites, which account for over half the energy-related CO2 emissions. CCS can also be used in conjunction with CO2-enhanced oil recovery, which offers a win-win opportunity by not only storing CO2, but also increasing oil reserves in mature fields.

Ladies and gentlemen,

As I suggested at the beginning of this address, the tragic events of the past couple of weeks have highlighted concern among consumers about security of supply in a manner that is reactive and predictable, and yet not necessary, in the light of the essential fundamentals in the oil market at the present time. A broader picture about energy security — as opposed to merely supply security — emerged at the G8 Summit in St Petersburg. And yet, even here, we feel that more confidence could have been expressed about the willingness and the ability of oil-producing developing countries to service the growing world energy requirement in the years ahead.

We find this unfortunate, because of OPEC’s dedicated commitment to this task over many years, as demonstrated by its repeated actions to achieve market order and stability under sometimes the most challenging conditions, as well as its investment in the future, to make sure that the market has the oil it needs as and when necessary in the years ahead.

This is in strict accordance with the central objectives of the Organization, as embodied in its Statute, which was drawn up shortly after OPEC’s establishment in 1960 and whose principles have been reaffirmed in subsequent definitive documents, such as two Solemn Declarations by the Heads of State and Government. Indeed, only last September, OPEC adopted a comprehensive Long-Term Strategy, whose objectives relate to the stability of the world oil market, with fair prices, the security of regular supply to consumers and the security of world oil demand.

I hope that all of the this conveys the clear message about OPEC’s abiding commitment to energy security, as part of a shared responsibility among the global community, as was made clear in St Petersburg.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/296-27-july-2006.html"
"2006-07-04","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The good thing about dinner-debates is that they provide both physical nourishment and intellectual nourishment — and so there has been a double reason for me to travel to Strasbourg today! One might even add “sporting nourishment”, with the European Union providing all the teams for World Cup semi-finals! Let me, therefore, thank the organisers for inviting me to address you here at the European Parliament today, on behalf of OPEC, and for providing this further opportunity to exchange views between our two intergovernmental groups.

In a way, this evening’s dinner-debate can be viewed as the latest chapter in the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue, which, as you know, was established in Brussels a year ago and began producing tangible results almost immediately. Already there is a much clearer understanding of the respective views of the two sides on many important energy issues.

We have believed, in OPEC, for a long time that an effective and sustained process of dialogue is essential to the future of the industry. Other exchanges in which we are actively involved, both formally and informally, bear witness to this, such as, most recently, with China, Russia and the United States of America. A common theme in these discussions is energy security, and there is now a general view that this must be a shared responsibility — as indeed witnessed by the theme of the recent Tenth Meeting of the specialist high-level producer-consumer body, the International Energy Forum. Energy security will also feature prominently at the G8 meeting Moscow later this month. It is clear from your decisions and actions, as well as your Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, that a similar outlook prevails in the European Union.

[Slide 2] Since time is short and the landscape for discussion large, I shall move straight on to the current outlook in the international oil market. I shall gradually shift the focus to more-distant horizons, up to 2025, and then look at important related issues, such as energy security, the environment and the eradication of poverty. On the way, I shall provide some observations about your Green Paper in the spirit of dialogue between our two groups and, notably, our jointly expressed interest in stable, transparent and predictable oil markets.

[Slide 3] Turning to the current oil market outlook, let me state quite clearly that OPEC is always concerned about price volatility, as well as prices that are too far removed from market fundamentals. Prices that are too high will drive people away from oil, while prices that are too low will provide inadequate revenue for investment in future capacity. Volatility, in itself, is the enemy of sound investment strategies, on top of its other disruptions to our day-to-day lives. Nevertheless, we should note that, while nominal prices reached record levels earlier this year, in real terms, prices are still well below levels seen in the early 1980s, when OPEC’s Reference Basket would have reached US $85 a barrel, at today’s prices. Also, there has been a strong increase in non-energy commodity prices over the last two years, sometimes at rates greater than that of oil.

[Slide 4] The present volatility has a number of causes.

[Slide 5] First, oil demand growth has been exceptional. Fuelled by high economic growth, global oil demand surged in 2004 by 3.0 million barrels a day, a level of demand growth not seen since the early 1970s. This moderated somewhat last year, with demand growing by just under 1 mb/d, although the level has risen again slightly since then.

[Slide 6] There has also been tightness in the downstream sector, which has been putting pressure on not just product prices, but also crude prices. In three key regions of the world — Asia, Europe and the United States — refineries have been operating at 90 per cent of capacity and above for much of the time. There is also a lack of capacity to process heavier sour crudes, causing the differentials between crude grades to increase. Factors behind this have been a lack of timely investment in the downstream sector and increasingly stringent product regulations motivated by environmental concerns.

[Slide 7] Also influencing price movements has been increased activity in the futures market, with a new inflow of capital movements by hedge and pension funds. Indeed, open interest contracts in the NYMEX passed the one million mark for the first time in April, with volumes almost doubling since 2003 — this is more than ten times the total oil supply in the world physical market at the present time. Total assets under management by hedge funds are estimated to be in the region of $1.5 trillion. There is much discussion about the effect of all this on oil market volatility and rising prices, and this is why, as part of the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue, we shall be meeting in December to examine the impact of financial markets on oil prices.

Add to this mix natural disasters and uncertainties stemming from geopolitical developments and it is understandable why there is so much volatility at the present time. Last year, for example, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita initially removed 1.5 mb/d of oil from the market, and, even now, ten months later, around 200,000 b/d are yet to come back on-stream.

[Slide 8] In response to all this, our Member Countries have increased production by around 4.5 mb/d since 2002. As a result, there have been no actual supply shortages; [Slides 9 and 10] indeed, recently, stocks have increased to levels above their five-year average in the OECD, particularly in the USA. [Slide 11] And, where possible, our Member Countries have accelerated their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and re-establish a comfortable cushion of spare capacity. This has been in spite of the current high costs in the industry, which in turn have arisen, at least in part, from shortages, especially in services and human resources, following the period of low prices witnessed in the not-too-distant past.

With OPEC’s upstream capacity on course to rise to around 33 mb/d by the end of the year, against an expected average output of 28.6 mb/d for the year, our spare capacity should exceed ten per cent, a level which past experience has shown to be very comfortable for the market. Moreover, with more than 100 projects in the execution or planning stage in Member Countries, totalling over 11 mb/d of gross production of oil and other liquids, OPEC’s policy has ensured that this trend of ample production and sufficient spare capacity will continue.

This demonstrates OPEC’s commitment to ensuring that consumers receive their oil in an orderly, timely and efficient manner, as and when they need it and at fair and reasonable prices.

Our Member Countries have also increased investment in downstream projects, on their own and in partnership with others. Present estimates show that this will result in, at least, 2.5 mb/d of additional refinery capacity by 2010, with more being considered. However, this does not escape the fact that downstream investment is primarily the responsibility of consuming countries, and that the indications are that this sector could remain a key source of price volatility for some time to come, with expansion lagging behind demand growth. [Slide 12] Also, as with the upstream, this has been happening during a period of high costs. As you know, a joint EU-OPEC study will be begun soon on investment needs in the refining sector and the role of the refining industry in oil markets.

[Slide 13] When looking further into the future, over the next 20 years, OPEC shares the view of most analysts that energy supply will continue to rely primarily on fossil fuels, underpinning socioeconomic development throughout the world. With regard to renewables, while these constitute an important option that needs to be developed at every opportunity, in reality, there are still many hurdles to overcome. It is likely to be decades before renewables acquire a significant share of the world energy mix.

Oil is expected to retain the leading position in meeting the world’s growing energy needs, accounting for close to 40 per cent of energy demand over the next two decades, according to OPEC’s latest reference case projections.

This scenario forecasts a 30 mb/d rise in demand by 2025, to reach 113 mb/d. The transportation sector will be the main source of future oil demand growth, while developing countries, especially from Asia, are set to account for four-fifths of the rise. There are clear signs of a shift in the centre of gravity of the global economy and, hence, energy demand. Prime movers, in this respect, have been China and India, with their huge populations and rapid economic growth, as well as competitive labour and other production costs. On top of this are challenges created in an increasingly globalised economy by urbanisation, especially in developing countries, and ageing populations, particularly in wealthier societies. However, in spite of all this, by 2025, OECD countries will remain the dominant oil consumer and will continue to use, on average, five times more oil per person than developing countries.

[Slide 14] As is widely recognised by knowledgeable and reputable organisations, the global resource base is sufficient to deal with the forecast increases in world oil demand. Estimates of global ultimately recoverable reserves for conventional oil have been increasing, due to such factors as technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery from existing fields. In addition, there is a vast resource base of non-conventional oil to develop.

[Slide 15] In the medium term, non-OPEC supply has the potential to rise substantially, with growth projected at 6 mb/d in the present period of 2005–10. However, it is eventually expected to reach a plateau after 2015, at 58–59 mb/d.

In the longer term, therefore, it is expected that OPEC, with nearly four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel of demand. Nevertheless, by 2025, non-OPEC countries will still account for the larger part of world oil production, and they will continue to play a central role in meeting world oil demand.

[Slide 16] OPEC’s willingness and ability to supply the incremental barrel demonstrates the seriousness it attaches to energy security. Indeed, we have no difficulty in recognising the concern of consuming countries over security of supply. But the need for enhanced energy security has to be seen from both the supply and demand perspectives. Security of supply and security of demand are mutually supportive. Uncertainty over future demand translates into large uncertainties over the amount of oil that OPEC Member Countries will eventually need to supply, signifying a heavy burden of risk. Investment requirements are very large and subject to long lead-times and pay-back periods. With more transparency in the evolution and implementation of policies, better assessments can be made to undertake the appropriate capacity expansion and not waste precious financial resources.

[Slide 17] Uncertainties over future oil demand translate into a wide range of possible levels of necessary investment in OPEC Member Countries. Even over the medium term to 2010, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment, increasing to $140 bn by 2015 and as much as $240 bn by 2020.

[Slide 18] The issue of security of demand is, therefore, a genuine one. And, while I am on the subject of security, I should like to make some observations about the Green Paper, which we welcome as timely, and an excellent platform for sharing views, ideas and visions.

First of all, we believe that a successful European energy policy should have a clearer understanding of the interests of the countries outside Europe, both suppliers of energy and consumers — indeed, the Energy Dialogue is already making progress in this respect. While the Green Paper emphasises the EU’s growing energy import dependence, we prefer to look at the overall situation as being one of interdependence, rather than dependence. A general principle of the Green Paper is security of energy supply. Nevertheless, as I noted earlier, security of demand is also essential, and the uncertainty over future demand, which is also affected by changes in energy policy trends, is a key concern for OPEC. Some of the proposed actions contained in the Green Paper clearly exacerbate this concern. For example, the implementation of provisions relating to energy taxes and domestic subsidies could discriminate heavily against oil, which would clearly interfere with the market and distort competition. The Green Paper does not address the importance of investment in the oil downstream sector, particularly in refining, nor the need for measures to improve the investment climate for refinery expansion and operations. Another important topic discussed within the EU-OPEC Dialogue is the impact of financial markets on commodity prices; it would have been useful to have included this issue within the Green Paper. But OPEC welcomes the emphasis the Green Paper places on carbon capture and storage (CCS).

[Slide 19] Indeed, a key question is whether the increasing use of fossil fuels is consistent with the protection of the environment, in particular regarding concerns over possible climate change, where technological options that allow the continued use of oil and gas in a carbon-constrained world must be considered. One promising example is CCS, applied to large stationary sources of CO2 emissions, such as power stations and industrial sites, which account for over half the energy-related CO2 emissions. CCS can also be used in conjunction with CO2 enhanced oil recovery, which offers a win-win opportunity by not only storing CO2, but also increasing oil reserves in mature fields. If CCS is to be used on a scale that would make a significant impact upon net CO2 emissions, it could develop into a significant business opportunity for the oil industry, and here we see great potential for cooperation between EU and OPEC countries. However, we also believe that that EU and other developed countries should take the lead in the area of providing cleaner oil and gas technologies by promoting large-scale demonstration projects, including the use of the clean development mechanism in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. To this end, we look forward to the joint conference of CCS in Riyadh on 21 September.

[Slide 20] Clean and safe energy is also a vital requirement for developing countries as they seek access to modern energy services in their often protracted struggle for socio-economic development, sometimes from a state of extreme poverty. Without outside assistance, many appear to have no means of escape from the poverty trap. We are constantly mindful of the fact that poverty eradication is the first UN Millennium Development Goal, and a comprehensive and balanced approach to implementing the three pillars of sustainable development — economic growth, social progress and protection of the environment — is required. Energy security applies to all nations of the world, and the eradication of energy poverty demands urgent attention. All of us in this room are, of course, already aware of this, and it has an acknowledged role to play in the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue, which refers explicitly to contributing to meeting the broader challenges facing mankind.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

The challenges facing all of us in the energy industry are formidable. However, there is already much common ground between the EU and OPEC with regard to fundamental issues regarding oil matters and this has been enhanced by the early achievements of our Energy Dialogue. It would be heartening to all of us if such multilateralism could be translated onto the global stage, addressing broader-based issues, enhancing the role of such global agencies as the United Nations and fostering peace and prosperity in all regions.

Finally, I hope that, during this address, I have managed to introduce many ideas that will help stimulate a lively and edifying debate.

[Slide 21] Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/297-4-july-2006.html"
"2006-06-22","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me start by thanking Dr Richard Schenz, the President of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Austria, for inviting me to address this Annual General Assembly here in Vienna. OPEC appreciates the importance of sharing its views with business leaders, such as those of you here this evening, and given that Vienna has been the location for the OPEC Secretariat since 1965, it is always pleasing for myself, or any OPEC representative, to address a gathering in the Organization’s home city. A short train journey is also greatly preferable to an airport check-in and a long flight!

The topic I have been asked to focus on today is the ‘Global Oil Outlook to 2025’, which offers me a broad remit of topical oil industry discussion points. However, I am conscious that this gathering is representative of the ICC; the voice of world business championing the global economy as a force for economic growth, job creation and prosperity. So I will look to interweave some of the issues directly relevant to the ICC and the audience before me.

I am sure that, if I opened the floor to questions, the first one for many of you would be: why are oil prices at their current level? It is a topic that has provided journalists with many column inches and I am sure it has been much discussed amongst business leaders the world over. Therefore, let me begin by addressing the price issue.

[Slide 2] It has been well documented that energy prices have risen to unexpectedly high levels over the past three years. In June 2003, the OPEC Reference Basket price stood at approximately $27 a barrel, but today it has risen in nominal terms to about $65 a barrel. I would like to point out, however, that in real terms, prices have been lower than the levels seen in the early 1980s, when the OPEC Reference Basket — projected backwards — reached over $85 a barrel in today’s prices. In the gas market too, prices have risen considerably over the past three years and I understand this has been a significant concern to many European Union (EU) countries. It should also be noted that over the same period there has been a strong increase in non-energy commodity prices, sometimes at rates greater than that of oil. This fact is often overlooked.

[Slide 3] With recent oil prices in mind, what I would like to point out is that for the last two years the oil market has been very much out of kilter with what has gone before. Prior to 2004, there was a relatively simple rule of thumb. If commercial stocks in consuming countries, particularly OECD countries, were high, then prices would generally fall. If these stocks were low, then the opposite was normally true. This rule of thumb is part and parcel of what the industry terms ‘the oil market fundamentals’. This was very much in evidence seven-to-eight years ago when petroleum-exporting countries suffered from very low oil prices, due in part to high levels of OECD commercial stocks. During that period the OPEC Reference Basket Price fell below $10 a barrel.

[Slide 4] Today the level of OECD commercial stocks is also high, in fact at a five-year peak, yet as we all know the price of oil remains on the high-side. It begs the question: what are the key drivers impacting the recent oil price rises? The movements have in fact been influenced by a convergence of factors: the exceptionally strong economic growth and, in turn, oil demand growth, with a global increase of 5.4 million barrels a day (mb/d) over the three years to 2005; tightness in the downstream refining sector, where utilisation rates have exceeded 90 per cent in most regions; speculative behaviour – indeed, contract volumes for crude oil on the NYMEX have almost doubled since 2003; as well as additional issues concerning geopolitical tensions and some major natural disasters.

[Slide 5] OPEC continues to play its part in keeping the market well-supplied; its Members have increased production by around 4.0 mb/d since 2002, but the factors currently impacting price, extend beyond its reach. All in all, OPEC is not comfortable with prices at the present very high levels, because they are not supported by oil market fundamentals and contain within them the seeds of further volatility. Extreme price levels, whether too high or too low, as was the case in the late 1990s, are detrimental to both producers and consumers.

[Slide 6] Nevertheless, despite the recent high price levels what I should highlight to this audience is the continued resilience of the world economy. Last year, growth rates were substantial and rates of core inflation remained under control despite higher oil prices. It is estimated that since 2002 the impact on global GDP of the rise in oil prices has been less than one per cent.

This year, OECD economies are expected to see little impact, as financial conditions remain accommodative, and solid increases in business and household incomes should permit the advanced economies to absorb higher costs. Improvements in energy efficiency and globalisation have also reduced the impact of higher oil prices, relative to such occurrences in the past.

While the impact on developing countries is varied, the healthy momentum of world trade and strong commodity prices can be expected to support growth in most economies. In some cases, the removal of fuel subsidies has pushed up inflation, and poorer economies may suffer from increased balance of payments deficits. In this regard, OPEC is concerned that higher oil prices may affect the prospects of developing countries, and so it will continue to closely observe developments. Globally, the world economy is expected to continue its sustained growth this year, at a rate similar to that of 2005, but again we understand that this needs to be closely monitored.

[Slide 7] Talk of the global economy leads me onto the role of energy in our everyday lives. It is no secret to anyone here this evening that energy is required to support both economic prosperity and social development; whether it be at the individual, business, country, continent or global level. And it is no less a secret that oil has been, and will continue to be, the most significant fuel in the global energy mix. By 2025, the share of oil is expected to be 39 per cent, down one percentage point from today, but still well above gas, which is expected to have the second largest share in 2025, at about 28 per cent.

[Slide 8] For many here, I envision the response to these long-term figures might be, ‘this is all well and good, but are the resources available to meet future demand in the coming decades?’ OPEC’s unequivocal response to this question is undoubtedly: yes. There is no physical shortage of the necessary resources to meet the demand in today's developed and emerging economies, as well as other economies that are expected to reach take-off point in the early 21st century.

Estimates of global ultimately recoverable reserves for conventional oil have been increasing, due to such factors as technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery from existing fields. Indeed, US Geological Survey estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves have practically doubled since the early 1980s, from just 1,700 billion barrels to over 3,300 billion barrels. On top of this, there is a vast resource base of non-conventional oil to explore and develop.

[Slide 9] Yet what needs to remembered in the international oil market today, as well as in the outlook to 2025, is the overall importance of market stability. As I am sure you will all acknowledge, market stability in any business environment is preeminent. This is well understood by OPEC, which has a longstanding commitment to oil market stability, as embodied both in the OPEC Statute and the recently released OPEC Long-Term Strategy. The Strategy lays out a coherent and consistent framework for the Organization’s future, with the recognition of oil’s importance in meeting future global energy demand and its significance to the future socio-economic development of OPEC Member Countries.

The specific value associated to market stability plays out in the topic on everyone’s lips today: global energy security. This topic is expected to top the agenda at the G8 Summit in St Petersburg next month and was mentioned at the US-EU Summit in Vienna yesterday. Given its importance I feel it is essential that I clarify what the term ‘global energy security’ actually means and stress the strong linkage between security of supply and security of demand.

[Slide 10] In a nutshell, the two are intertwined. It is not just a question of whether there will be enough supply to meet demand; it is a question of whether there will be enough demand to meet current and predicted supply. I am sure I am probably preaching to the converted with this statement: the basic idea of supply and demand is perhaps one of the most fundamental concepts of economics and will provide a platform for the development of most business strategies. Thus the basis for ‘global energy security’ is a balanced and mutually supportive supply and demand network at reasonable price levels to both consumers and producers. This platform built on a shared responsibility, provides the stability from which consumers and producers can develop, build on, and adapt both short- and long-term supply and demand strategies to meet the market’s needs, to the benefit of individuals and business, and to rich and poor nations alike.

[Slide 11] On the supply side, OPEC has responded to the need for additional oil. As I mentioned earlier, its Members have increased production significantly since 2002. More increases in capacity are also planned – and being implemented – for the rest of the decade. OPEC capacity growth is underpinned by more than 100 exploration and production projects totalling in excess of $100 billion. This investment is expected to further increase OPEC spare capacity to between 5 and 8 mb/d over the next five years and is a demonstration of its continued commitment to oil market stability, and security of supply.

It should also be remembered that despite the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last summer, OPEC’s assurances of healthy supply – accompanied by positive statements from the International Energy Agency – helped prevent that supply interruption from developing into a major oil market crisis.

[Slide 12] Nevertheless, as I underlined a minute or so ago, enhanced energy security must also be viewed from the demand perspective. Doubts over future oil demand translate into large uncertainties over the amount that OPEC Member Countries will eventually need to supply, signifying a heavy burden of risk. This can be seen in three consistent scenarios explored in OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy. The first of these — “dynamics-as-usual” — envisages a future following previous oil demand patterns, while the other two — “protracted market tightness” and “prolonged soft market” — look at futures leading to lower and higher rates of oil demand growth respectively. It should be remembered that in the oil industry, investment requirements are very large and subject to long lead-times and pay-back periods.

The challenges that may impact future world oil demand are laid out in OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy document. This includes expanding vehicle usage, country demographics, consuming countries’ energy and environmental policies, technology development and future world economic growth. Questions over how future non-OPEC production might evolve further compounds the uncertainty regarding how much oil will be needed from OPEC to achieve a supply and demand balance.

[Slide 13] Let me take a couple of these challenges and underline how some of the uncertainties might play out. Firstly, let me explore the anticipated growth in global vehicle usage. This is expected to be particularly high in countries that have large populations and are currently seeing rapid rates of economic growth. China and India, with healthy annual growth rates and a combined population approaching 2.5 billion very much fit into this category. In China and India today, there are just 10-to-20 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with more than 500 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in the OECD region. With the transportation sector expected to be the single most important source of demand increase, there is clearly enormous potential for growth in this sector in these two countries alone.

It is important to stress, however, that the OECD region is still expected to be consuming more oil than developing countries by 2025. Moreover, there will remain large differences in consumption per head, with developing countries consuming on average five times less oil per person by 2025 compared to the OECD.

[Slide 14] Given this fact, and moving onto my second point, oil demand will also be greatly affected by consuming countries’ policies, especially OECD countries. Taxation of energy products is often seen not only as a means of raising revenue, but also as a means of controlling demand in addressing environment and energy security issues. Policies demonstrate significant discrimination against oil, involving not only higher tax rates, but also subsidies for competing fuels. Great uncertainty exists in relation to future developments of consuming countries’ policies and this is considered one of the main constraints in ensuring adequate security of demand. Scenarios developed at the OPEC Secretariat show that such policies alone could potentially introduce demand uncertainty of the order of 5-to-10 mb/d to 2025.

[Slide 15] If we return to the three scenarios in OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy, we see that the difference between the lower and higher rates of oil demand growth out to 2020 is more than 12 mb/d. [Slide 16] What this figure represents becomes distinctively more apparent when talk turns to investment. The expected range is somewhere between $230 billion and $470 billion. A range of uncertainty of $240 billion would make any industry CEO sit up and take note.

The issue of security of demand is, therefore, a very genuine one. Without the confidence that demand for OPEC oil will emerge, the incentive to undertake investment can be reduced. The possible emergence of large levels of unused capacity would put downward pressure on oil prices. This would result in huge revenue losses, and OPEC’s Member Countries, as developing countries with strong competing needs for financial resources, would be adversely affected in terms of available resources for such areas as education, healthcare and infrastructure.

[Slide 17] The investment challenge, however, extends along the entire supply chain. The downstream sector is a very important part of that chain, with current tightness in the form of inadequate refining capacity, as I pointed out earlier, putting much pressure on oil prices generally. Several factors will shape developments in this sector in the coming decade: the rising volume of crude oil that needs to be refined, the expectation of a continued move towards demand for lighter products, and the trend of product specifications towards significantly cleaner products.

[Slide 18] It is estimated that about $160 billion in downstream capacity investment will be required by 2015, with another $150 billion needed for maintenance and replacement of lost capacity. These estimates do not include the infrastructure required beyond the refinery gate, such as pipelines and terminals. A more orchestrated effort is clearly required to ensure that sufficient capacities are in place in the future. There is, therefore, a pressing need for ways to be explored that could accelerate expansion plans. Most importantly, however, it needs to be recognised that the primary responsibility for investment in this sector lies with consuming countries.

[Slide 19] Beyond the investment challenge, a critical question is whether the increasing use of fossil fuels is consistent with the ‘third pillar’ of sustainable development — as defined by the United Nations — namely the protection of the environment. Firstly we should note that the oil industry has a long history of successfully improving the environmental credentials of oil, addressing concerns of local pollution and improving air quality. These improvements are expected to continue in the future. Attention therefore turns to concerns over possible climate change. Most energy scenarios project a substantial increase in CO2 emissions throughout this century. Since well over half the emissions are attributable to power stations and industrial activities, these sectors, therefore, constitute prime targets for emission reduction efforts.

I should also like to stress that OPEC also recognises that its Member Countries need to play an active role in addressing climate change concerns. In regard to these concerns, and given that all forecasts suggest that fossil fuels will continue to provide the overwhelming share of energy for many decades to come, technological options that allow the continued use of oil and gas in a carbon-constrained world must be considered. It should specifically be remembered that fossil fuels have a major role to play in sustainable development and providing energy services to the poor. In fact, just as oil played a key role in fuelling the development of the industrialised countries in the 20th century, it should also be allowed to make a similar important contribution to supporting growth in developing world economies in the future.

[Slide 20] One promising technological option is carbon capture and storage, which could represent an affordable means of responding to climate change concerns. Industrialised countries, having the financial and technological capabilities, should take the lead in this area, by promoting large-scale demonstration projects and the application of this technology, including through the use of the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism, in accordance with the principle of common, but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

[Slide 21] This principle provides a direct link into an area that OPEC places great credence on today: the issue of shared responsibility advanced through dialogue and cooperation. It is vital that we all understand the needs of each stakeholder. To this end OPEC continues to devote much effort in this direction, with dialogue now being widened and deepened in an open and constructive spirit. The most recent result of this was the establishment, last year, of energy dialogues between OPEC and, respectively, the European Union, China and Russia.

In fact much of the EU-OPEC dialogue so far this year has been carried out during Austria's Presidency of the European Union. This began with a Ministerial-level meeting between Dr Edmund Daukoru, President of the OPEC Conference and Minister of State for Petroleum Resources of Nigeria, and Dr Martin Bartenstein, President of the EU Energy Council and Minister of Economy and Labour of Austria, in Vienna in February. And just a fortnight ago, there was the Third Meeting of the EU-OPEC dialogue in Brussels, which the two parties welcomed as a further step in constructive dialogue between producers and consumers and where they reaffirmed their mutual interest in stable, transparent and predictable oil markets.

In addition, informal discussions between senior officials from OPEC and the EU took place at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January and the 10th International Energy Forum (IEF) in Doha in April. The latter brought together both producers and consumers and underscored the importance of transparency and exchange of energy data for market predictability and stability, so as to provide a more stable investment climate while supporting planning and enhancing global energy security. I am sure you all appreciate the value of having access to accurate data and information in order to make the right investment decisions.

[Slide 22] Dialogue and cooperation are obviously important to the issues and challenges I have already highlighted this evening. However, it also critical to a challenge that all industries face: that of human resources. As we all understand, the human resource is what drives business the world over. This was a specific focus of the IEF Meeting in Doha, where Ministers acknowledged the shortage of human resources throughout the energy industry as a problem that must be addressed jointly by companies and governments. Given the expected expansion of the oil market it is essential that knowledge is shared on human resource development, both within regions and globally, and between producers and consumers.

The focus should be twofold: firstly to help facilitate education and training in energy disciplines to provide specialised manpower for operational and research staffing in the energy industry, and secondly, to make the industry attractive to prospective employees the world over. This is especially true in attracting young engineers to the industry. Yet what needs to be recognised in all this is that the cost of the human resource is rising and any additional manpower to meet anticipated oil market growth will significantly impact upon a company’s bottom line.

[Slide 23] Before I close I would just like to recap on some of the issues I have addressed this evening. The ‘Global Oil Outlook to 2025’ offers both challenges and opportunities, from the supply and demand perspectives, as well as from the standpoint of both upstream and downstream, in terms of investment, and with regard to technology and the environment. The central thrust of these challenges and opportunities is global energy security for all. We should never lost sight of the fact, however, that this means different things to different people. In the developing world, the lack of basic energy services is a severe impediment to the alleviation of poverty. Halving the proportion of people in the world whose income is less than $1 a day was actually the first declared ‘Millennium Development Goal’. Bringing people out of energy poverty is a focus for us all, and the benefits for those involved are obviously huge.

As an industry we have to be inclusive: to think and plan ahead and to look at the needs of producers and consumers, as well as both developed and developing nations, not just this year and next, but over the next decade and beyond. I hope this evening I have successfully managed to enlighten you on the efforts that OPEC makes to bring about order and stability in the international market, both today and in the future, and in support of energy security and sound growth across the global economy to the benefit of all.

[Slide 24] Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/298-22-june-2006.html"
"2006-06-20","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me start by thanking the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly for the opportunity to address such a distinguished gathering. And, given that the specific focus of today’s assembly is “the problems of energy in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries”, I feel honoured that OPEC, its Members all developing countries themselves, has been asked to present its views.

This is especially timely for us because it comes less than a fortnight after the Third Meeting of the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue in Brussels. The two parties at that ministerial-level meeting welcomed it as a further step in constructive dialogue between petroleum producer and consumer countries and reaffirmed their mutual interest in stable, transparent and predictable oil markets. They also recognised the important contribution the Energy Dialogue could make to broader challenges facing mankind, in particular sustainable development and the eradication of poverty.

I would like to initially draw attention to the draft report put before the Joint Parliamentary Assembly today and specifically pick out mention of the 17 July 2002 communication from the European Commission to the Council and the European Parliament that focuses on energy cooperation with developing countries. The communication calls for energy to account for a greater share of development aid and stresses the central role it plays in three areas: the social dimension, the spotlight here being on poverty reduction; the economic dimension, where security of supply is underlined; and the environmental dimension.

At OPEC, we identify with these dimensions and acknowledge that the three must go hand-in-hand in order to ease the plight of other developing nations, in particular by helping them pursue the goals of sustainable development. As an Organization, we do this in many ways: through the OPEC Fund for International Development that was set up in 1976 with the mandate to “reinforce financial cooperation between OPEC Member Countries and other developing countries and promote South-South solidarity”; through many other multilateral and bilateral aid institutions of which OPEC countries are active members; and in the provision of energy.

The social dimension was never more evident than at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002. With 1.1 billion people currently living on less than $1 a day, the Summit declared, at the highest international level, a global commitment to establish a strong link between poverty eradication and sustainable development. In fact, poverty eradication comes first on the list of the eight Millennium Development Goals. Directly supporting this goal is the eradication of energy poverty.

For the 1.6 billion people in developing countries lacking access to modern energy services, energy is not about what many in the developed world take for granted: the pumps being full, the public transport system working effectively, or the car starting up every morning. It is instead about having basic energy services as a means of eradicating poverty and enhancing their standard of living from very low levels. Notwithstanding this, of course, the eventual goal must be equality between the developing and developed worlds in energy services and social provision.

We must, therefore, ensure that international attention remains firmly focused on the current state of poverty, and the directly associated concern of energy poverty, in developing countries. OPEC concurs with the central objective of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement that highlights the reduction and eventual eradication of poverty in line with the objectives of sustainable development and the gradual integration of ACP countries into the world economy.

Talk of the world economy leads me onto the economic dimension and the role energy plays in providing a solid, stable platform for growth. As developing countries, OPEC Members appreciate the two key elements of this dimension: first, energy as a commodity, and secondly, revenues from oil sales. Both of these are integral in driving economic development. However, OPEC Members also recognise that many developing countries have no exploitable energy resources, and this can obviously impact upon the prospects for economic and social progress.

As I mentioned earlier, the OPEC Fund plays a significant role in helping the socioeconomic development of other developing countries. To date, the OPEC Fund has committed nearly US $8 billion in grants and loans. And, with regard to the oil market, OPEC remains unswerving in its commitment to stabilising the market at prices acceptable to both consumers and producers. Given the current level of oil prices, let me take this opportunity to explore this commitment in more detail.

Since its establishment in 1960, OPEC has been committed to market stability and to ensuring an efficient, economic and regular supply of oil to consumers. Recently, it has accelerated its capacity expansion plans, despite significantly rising costs, to help meet future growing demand for its oil and offer an adequate level of spare capacity, for the benefit of the world at large. In fact, I would like to stress that current supply levels are ahead of demand, as the present comfortable levels of stocks in OECD countries demonstrate. There is — let me hasten to add — no shortage of supply.

So what are the key drivers impacting upon the oil price? Downstream tightness, due very much to a lack of refining investment from consuming countries, as well as increased speculative activity in the futures market and geopolitical developments, are certainly having a pronounced effect on prices. These are all issues that extend beyond OPEC’s reach.

We appreciate the concerns underlined in the ACP-EU draft report about the strains that recent price levels for oil and gas are having on the balance of payments of ACP States. Let me reiterate that OPEC’s priority is market stability, but this can only be achieved with the support of other stakeholders, especially the major consuming nations. Hence the importance of such Energy Dialogues as that between the EU and OPEC.

Let me also briefly touch on the report’s mention that the current price levels for hydrocarbons are leading ACP countries to consider renewables as an energy resource. Of course, renewables have a role to play in the global energy mix, but what needs to remembered is that this can only be a small role for the foreseeable future. Moreover, this role will probably be more significant in industrialised countries that possess the resources and technological know-how. For the developing world, however, it is far too early to expect these still embryonic technologies to provide cost-effective solutions.

According to all forecasts, fossil fuels will continue to provide the overwhelming share of energy for decades to come. Therefore, they have a major role to play in sustainable development and providing energy services to the poor. In fact, it should be stressed that, just as oil played a key part in fuelling the development of the industrialised countries in the 20th century, it should be allowed to make a similar important contribution to supporting growth in developing world economies in the future.

It should also be remembered that it is the industrialised countries that are, and will continue to be, the major global energy consumers. As a result, this needs to be taken into consideration when we focus on climate change concerns. All this, however, does not alter the fact that OPEC Member Countries remain committed to working with all parties to achieve sound and balanced environmental initiatives that address such concerns.

Nevertheless, this should not undermine the ability of developing countries to pursue their legitimate goals of economic and social advancement. This statement should be kept in mind when we focus on the environmental dimension. For example, OPEC recognises that meeting environmental challenges can provide a great opportunity for all developing countries to leapfrog some of the technology steps that industrialised countries have taken during their industrialisation process. However, they cannot do this without considerable cooperation and assistance from industrialised countries.

Given the need for environmental protection and the expected leading role for fossil fuels going forward, this cooperation and assistance becomes very apparent in the promotion of cleaner fossil fuel technologies that offer cost-effective solutions, such as carbon capture and storage. In conjunction with enhanced oil recovery, the development of these technologies offers a win-win opportunity.

In line with the principle of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’, OPEC believes that industrialised countries should take the lead in the development of carbon capture and storage technologies, in particular in funding and executing large demonstration projects. The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol should also be adapted to facilitate the application of cleaner fossil fuel technologies in developing countries.

It is clear that the social, economic and environmental dimensions of energy outlined by the ACP-EU draft report are interlinked. What needs to be understood is that this direct linkage should be taken into consideration when examining the means of meeting the goals of these three dimensions. OPEC stresses that the evaluation of the available energy resources to meet these goals should be undertaken in accordance with objective criteria, such as reliability, affordability, economic viability, social acceptance and environmental soundness.

First and foremost, however, what needs to be emphasised is that alarming disparities continue to exist between developed and developing countries. Eliminating these disparities must be viewed as an international priority. OPEC believes that overcoming them and meeting the challenges of poverty eradication, economic growth, energy security, climate change and sustainable development requires a comprehensive and balanced approach.

Thus we welcome enhanced dialogue and cooperation, such as that set up last year between OPEC and the EU and which is already being translated into concrete plans of action, as we witnessed a fortnight ago in Brussels.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/299-20-june-2006.html"
"2006-06-11","Ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to deliver this keynote address at the 11th Annual Asia Oil and Gas Conference here in Kuala Lumpur. The subject of my address — “OPEC and non-OPEC” — is a principal element of the overall theme of the conference — “Balancing the interests of consumers and producers” — and is a matter to which we attach much importance. Balancing these interests in a successful and sustainable manner is, indeed, a challenge for all of us and is fundamental to the future healthy development of the international oil market.

(Slide 2) I shall start my address by reviewing the current situation in the market, because I know that this is of most immediate concern to us. I shall then examine the respective positions of OPEC and non-OPEC producers, the relationship between them and the role they play in meeting oil demand both now and in the future. This will involve providing projections about world oil demand and supply over the next two decades. My concluding remarks will touch on investment and stress the importance of dialogue and cooperation in the process of ensuring that OPEC and non-OPEC producers can successfully meet the challenges that lie ahead of them, to the benefit of producers and consumers alike.

So let us now look at the current situation in the market.

(Slide 3) I must begin by stating loud and clear that OPEC is not comfortable with prices at the present high levels. We have witnessed record levels in the second quarter of this year, and the price of OPEC’s Reference Basket has risen above US $65 a barrel, which means it has doubled in just two years. Nevertheless, in real terms, prices are still well below the levels seen in the early 1980s, when the OPEC Basket would have reached $85/b, at today’s prices. We should also not forget that, over the last two years, there has been a strong increase in non-energy commodity prices, sometimes at rates greater than that of oil. This is an often overlooked fact, but it needs to be expressed to provide a more complete picture of the present global situation.

In simple marketing terms, prices that are too high will drive people away from oil, as we saw a quarter of a century ago, while prices that are too low will provide inadequate revenue for investment in future capacity, as we witnessed in the late-1990s and which is why many under-financed refining sectors are suffering at the present time. Extreme prices in either direction will contain the seeds of volatility, as the market will — sooner or later and with or without some assistance — return to levels more in line with supply and demand fundamentals. And, as I am sure you are all well aware, volatility is the enemy of sound investment strategies.

Accordingly, OPEC seeks prices that are stable, sustainable, affordable across the market and provide fair and reasonable returns to producers and investors. It is, indeed, in the best interests of our Members that such a pricing environment exists, because the revenues we receive from our oil sales play a major part in the economic and social development of our countries, and such development thrives on stability and predictability. This is why OPEC has been making such a concerted effort to restore stability and reasonable prices to the market over the past two years.

The present volatility has a number of causes.

(Slide 4) First and foremost, oil demand growth has been exceptional. Fuelled by high economic growth, global oil demand surged in 2004 by 2.9 million barrels a day. Such a high level of demand growth has not been seen since the early 1970s. North America and the developing countries, in particular China, were at the centre of this remarkable spurt. It moderated somewhat during 2005, with demand growing by just under 1 mb/d.

(Slide 5) There has also been a slow-down in the rate of expansion of non-OPEC supply. This has been, in part, a delayed reaction to the lower oil prices witnessed at the end of the 1990s, with the commensurate stalling of expenditure on exploration and development gradually being felt. Moreover, it has followed many years of non-OPEC supply growth exceeding that of OPEC, and often at faster-than predicted rates. I shall take an in-depth look at non-OPEC supply shortly, since it is the principal focus of this session.

(Slide 6) Next, there has been tightness in the downstream sector. In three key regions of the world — Asia, Europe and the United States — refineries have been operating at 90 per cent of capacity and above for much of the time. In this situation, any disruption can create product shortages — whether from a maintenance shutdown or an emergency such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. There is also a lack of capacity to process heavier sour crudes, causing the prices of light sweet crudes to climb even higher and the differentials between crude grades to increase. All these factors have contributed to downstream tightness, a situation that, based on the information available today, OPEC does not expect to ease in the near term.

(Slide 7) Also influencing price movements has been increased activity in the futures market, with a new inflow of capital movements by hedge and pension funds. Indeed, open interest contracts in the NYMEX passed the one million mark for the first time in April. Add to this mix, natural disasters and uncertainties stemming from geopolitical developments and it is understandable why there is so much volatility at the present time.

(Slide 8) OPEC has been responding as necessary to the need for additional oil, underlining, once again, its longstanding commitment to market stability, which dates back to the establishment of our Organization more than 45 years ago. (Slide 9) Indeed, OPEC’s Member Countries have increased production by around 4.5 mb/d since 2002, even though there have been no actual supply shortages; indeed, recently, stocks have increased to levels above their five-year average. (Slide 10) And, where possible, our Member Countries have accelerated their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and re-establish a comfortable level of spare capacity. Indeed, in September last year, OPEC agreed to make available to the market spare capacity of around two million barrels a day in Member Countries, should this be called for.

We have adopted these measures, even though, in reality, we have had little influence over the factors that have caused the volatility and rising prices. Nevertheless, we believe that the very fact that we are taking such measures sends a strong signal to the market about OPEC’s views on a particular set of events, and this, in itself, can have a stabilising effect on market sentiment. For example, last year, OPEC’s assurances of healthy supply helped prevent the supply interruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita from developing into a major crisis. These assurances were accompanied by similar positive statements from the International Energy Agency (IEA), whose 26 members include eight countries producing more than 50,000 b/d, among them the world’s third-largest producer, the USA. Similar joint assurances calmed markets at the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq in 2003.

In providing this short review of the current situation in the oil market, I have, at the same time, been able to draw attention to the ever-pervasive role of non-OPEC producers in the constantly shifting landscape.

(Slide 11) What is often overlooked here is the fact that, globally, non-OPEC production far outweighs OPEC production, by a factor of around three to two at the present time. Indeed, for only one period in OPEC’s 45-year history has the Organization accounted for more than half the world’s average crude output and that was in 1970–77, with OPEC’s share peaking at 55.4 per cent in 1973. After that, it fell heavily, to below 29 per cent in 1985 — in other words, OPEC’s share almost halved — before climbing back to around 40 per cent, where it has remained since the early 1990s — within a couple of percentage points either way. In case of crude oil exports, the OPEC’s share also slid albeit from close to 90% to around 50% at present.

(Slide 12) Of course, by definition, we are not comparing apples with apples. Our categorisation exists because OPEC is an established grouping of oil-producing developing countries, with 11 Members that are signatories to a set of common energy-related objectives, which have a big influence on their market behaviour. Such a formal collective oil market commitment does not — again, by definition — apply to non-OPEC producers. (Slide 13) Here, it must be pointed out that a majority of non-OPEC oil output — 57 per cent — comes from developed countries, due, particularly, to the high levels of production in Russia, the United States of America and Norway. However, significant levels do come from non-OPEC developing countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Angola and Malaysia.

Furthermore, both OPEC and non-OPEC producers may also be members of other energy groups, on either a regional or political basis, and these may themselves influence their behaviour in the market. Examples are the IEA, the African Petroleum Producers Association (APPA), the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) and the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC). Thus OPEC is not the only energy-oriented intergovernmental organization in which collective decisions or perspectives can influence market behaviour. This is an important and often-overlooked fact.

Nevertheless, even taking all of this into account, the situation is not as clearcut as it may at first seem. First and foremost, when stripped to its essentials, the reality is that OPEC producers, like non-OPEC producers, are simply trying to sell their commodity on competitive world markets and to do so at fair and reasonable prices. There is nothing magical about this idea or its implementation and it applies equally to producers of any commodity anywhere.

(Slide 14) There is no hard, impenetrable line between OPEC and non-OPEC; if anything, for many years there has been a steady softening of any divides that may have existed to any degree in the past. There have been major advances in cooperation and dialogue involving all the major players, and OPEC has been very much to the fore in encouraging these; the benefits are clear for all to see and can be felt right across the industry. And many non-OPEC producers openly support OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures, particularly at critical moments for the market, while others are quietly appreciative, recognising their identity of interests with those of our Organization and the responsible, carefully considered nature of such measures.

There is another important observation to make here and this is of more relevance to non-OPEC producers. It concerns the evolution of global oil supply. Access to convenient forms of energy has been essential for economic development and its subsequent sustainability. This has been as true for the 18th century industrial revolution in Great Britain as it is to the emerging economies of today. Since the early 20th century, national economic prosperity has been heavily dependant on easy access to oil supplies, starting in the USA and then spreading across the industrialised world.

Since the birth of the modern oil industry in the USA in the middle of the 19th century, the sources of supply have had a rich and varied history, as producers have sought to keep pace with the continued rises in demand in the world at large. Some prolific production areas have come and gone, while others remain major sources of supply and are likely to do so well into the future, especially in many OPEC countries.

(Slide 15) Even in the space of two decades, there have been major changes in the global supply balance. In North America, there has been a steadily falling trend, with output from the USA — the world’s leading consumer nation — dropping by nearly 40 per cent between 1984 and 2004. During that period, the USA began to import more than half its crude oil. The opposite trend has occurred in Latin America, where one of OPEC’s five Founder Members, Venezuela, accounts for nearly a third of the rising regional output.

There are contrasting trends in Europe too, with Eastern part, dominated by the former Soviet Union, showing steady growth in supply over the past five years, after the declines that came in the wake of the dissolution of that large economic bloc; however, output is still below that of 20 years ago. Also, the focus has switched to two distinct production areas, Russia and the Caspian states, and their characteristics differ considerably. In contrast, production in Western Europe, dominated by Norway and the United Kingdom, is on an inexorable downward trend, after peaking in the late 1990s; but it is still well above that of 1984.

(Slide 16) Production grew significantly in the three remaining regions between 1984 and 2004. As with Latin America, the oil producers in these regions are almost exclusively developing countries, the exceptions being the minor cases of Australia and New Zealand in “Asia and Pacific”. Also, each has an OPEC presence, which dominates in the Middle East, has the majority share in Africa and is small and declining in “Asia and Pacific”. Significantly, China, with its heavily rising demand for oil, became a major net importer of crude in the 1990s.

The real significance of all of this is that oil production is declining steadily across the industrialised world in both relative and absolute terms, and so advanced consumer nations are having to look elsewhere for their energy at a time when energy demand is rising rapidly in the emerging economies, particularly China and India. In the specific context of oil, therefore, the competition for sources of supply is already apparent across the world and the signs are that this will increase in the future, as the history of the oil industry enters a new chapter.

What is more, there are qualitative factors involved, since it is expected that there will be a continuation of the move towards demand for lighter products, as well as the trend towards providing significantly cleaner products. This will be in line with the fact that the oil industry has a long history of successfully improving the environmental credentials of oil, addressing concerns of local pollution and improving air quality.

When looking at the future, OPEC shares the view of most analysts that energy supply will continue to rely primarily on fossil fuels until at least the middle of the century, underpinning socioeconomic development throughout the world.

Oil is expected to retain the leading position in meeting the world’s growing energy needs, accounting for close to 40 per cent of energy demand over the next two decades, according to the reference case from the OPEC World Energy Model, “OWEM”.

(Slide 17) OWEM’s reference case scenario forecasts a 30 mb/d rise in demand by 2025, to reach 113 mb/d. This is an annual average rise of 1.5 mb/d. The transportation sector will be the main source of future oil demand growth, while developing countries, especially from Asia, are set to account for four-fifths of the rise, with consumption almost doubling to 53 mb/d. However, in spite of this, by 2025, OECD countries will remain the dominant oil consumer and the USA will continue to use five times more energy per person than China.

(Slide 18) As is widely recognised by knowledgeable and reputable organisations, the global resource base is sufficient to deal with the forecast increases in world oil demand. Estimates of global ultimately recoverable reserves for conventional oil have been increasing, due to such factors as technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery from existing fields. In addition, there is a vast resource base of non-conventional oil to explore and develop.

(Slide 19) In the medium term, non-OPEC supply has the potential to rise substantially, with growth projected at 6 mb/d in the present period of 2005–10. Indeed, the recent high oil prices have made more funds available for investment in non-OPEC oil. Russia and the Caspian region will lead non-OPEC growth, while, outside these areas, supply increases will be driven primarily by increases in the Gulf of Guinea and offshore Latin America, as well as non-conventional oil in North America. Non-OPEC supply, however, is eventually expected to reach a plateau after 2015, at 58–59 mb/d.

In the longer term, therefore, it is expected that OPEC, which has nearly four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves — will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel of demand. Hence most of the new demand will be met by non-OPEC in the short-to-medium term and by OPEC in the longer term. Our projections show that OPEC production levels, including natural gas liquids, will rise to 54 mb/d by 2025.

Nevertheless, even then — in two decades’ time — non-OPEC countries will still account for the larger part of world oil production, and they will continue to play a central role in meeting world oil demand.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The story does not quite end here. While it is clear that the world has enough oil resources to meet rising demand for decades to come, there is also the important consideration of getting it to consumers in an orderly, timely and sufficient manner — in other words, deliverability. This brings me onto the subject of investment and the fact that the requirements for investment in the oil industry are very large and subject to long lead-times and pay-back periods.

(Slide 20) But it is here that we run into problems of uncertainty and the huge risks this can impose on the industry if there ultimately proves to have been heavy over-investment or under-investment.

Uncertainties over future oil demand growth stem from a number of factors, including economic, energy and environmental policies in consuming countries, as well as technological progress and catastrophic events of an unpredictable nature. Every effort must be made to reduce the levels of uncertainty, wherever possible. This applies to both the upstream and, increasingly, the downstream, where shortages, as I mentioned earlier, have been playing a big part in the recent market volatility.

(Slide 21) This brings me back to the subject of dialogue and cooperation and the huge advances that have been made in this area in recent years, enabling OPEC and non-OPEC producers to become better-equipped to meet the challenges of the future and to find a better balance of interests between consumers and producers. OPEC places great credence on the issue of shared responsibility advanced through dialogue and cooperation. It is vital that we all understand the needs of each stakeholder.

For OPEC, this has played out in a number of non-OPEC producers participating as observers at the OPEC Conference. At the 141st (Extraordinary) Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Caracas earlier this month, the Minister of Petroleum of Angola and the Minister of Petroleum & Mineral Resources of the Syrian Arab Republic, as well as a high-ranking representative from the Ministry of Petroleum of Egypt, were present.

OPEC also actively participates in joint meetings of experts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries and in May the Fourth Joint OPEC/IEA Workshop took place in Oslo, focusing on the outlook and uncertainties in global oil demand. In 2005, OPEC also helped establish structured energy dialogues with respectively, the European Union, China and Russia.

It is also important that I mention the International Energy Forum (IEF), whose 10th meeting took place in Doha in April. The IEF brings together both producers and consumers and in Doha the importance of transparency and exchange of energy data for market predictability and stability, so as to provide a more stable investment climate while supporting planning and enhancing global energy security, was underscored. OPEC very much welcomes such actions.

As an industry we have to be inclusive: to think and plan ahead and to look at the needs of producers and consumers, as well as both developed and developing nations, not just this year and next, but over the next decade and beyond.

(Slide 22) Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/300-11-june-2006.html"
"2006-06-09","Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

Let me start by thanking our fellow G-77 & China members for honouring our invitation to this luncheon and for their request to OPEC to participate in the panel discussions yesterday. Such dialogues are always welcomed by OPEC.

I would also like to take this opportunity to extend our heartfelt congratulations to our fellow group members for their very significant achievements over the years. Going forward we appreciate that many challenges and opportunities lie before us and you can rest assured that OPEC will not shy away from its responsibilities.

Let me turn to the theme – ‘Energy for Development’ – and underline that the interests of G-77 & China and those of OPEC Members are very much aligned in this regard.

Let me take you back to the First OPEC Summit in Algiers in 1975. Here the Sovereigns and Heads of State of our Member Countries in a Solemn Declaration reaffirmed the natural solidarity that unites our Member Countries with other developing countries in their struggle to overcome under-development.

Bringing the timeframe forward to 2006, in February, the Paris Consensus adopted at the 39th Meeting of the Chairpersons of the G-77 & China emphasised the need for continuing unity and solidarity among countries of the South to preserve governance that nurtures the policy space necessary for developing countries to achieve their own development objectives.

At OPEC we believe this common goal will strengthen our cooperation especially as we continually look to ease the plight of developing nations, in particular by helping them pursue the goals of sustainable development. We do this in many ways: through the OPEC Fund for International Development, our individual Member Countries’ aid agencies and various multilateral financial institutions, as well as in the provision of an adequate, regular and secure supply of energy to the world at large.

We also support the goals of the G-77 & China in regards to its work with the World Trade Organization in developing a rule-based multilateral trading system that is equitable, fair and takes into account the policy space of developing countries. Trade should serve development and not be an aim in itself so as to ensure that all developing countries benefit from expansion in world trade.

As you may know, the Doha Round of WTO negotiations are at a very crucial juncture, with Ministerial negotiations set for the end of June. At the heart of the deliberations are development considerations, as clearly stated in the Doha Declaration and the July 2004 Agreement. This includes agreement on stronger and more effective policies that provide special and differential treatment for developing countries, as well as providing more effective ‘aid for trade’, enhancing technical co-operation, establishing links between trade, debt and finance, facilitating the transfer of technology and contributing to capacity building.

Failing to deliver on the development promises in all areas, particularly in agriculture, may result in the collapse of the trade talks. A failure of the Doha Development Round would undermine the multilateral trading system and lead to an even faster proliferation of bilateralism and regionalism.

We also recognise and appreciate the extremely important role and achievements of the G-77 & China in various other multilateral fora, for example, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development.

The reason these efforts, from both OPEC and the G-77 & China, are so important is that today we live in a world where energy and the three pillars of sustainable development, namely economic growth, social development and environmental protection, must go hand in hand. All are intrinsically linked.

This statement was never more evident than at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, which stressed the overriding priority of poverty eradication and the need for access to modern energy services in developing countries. For the 1.6 billion people in developing countries lacking access to electricity, energy is not just about the pumps being full, the public transport infrastructure ticking over, or the car starting up every morning. It is about having the basic energy services to support health care and education, provide the rudimentary conditions for economic development and enhance living standards.

What this underlines is that sustainable development means different things to different people. Some nations have developed very little, and others have developed along very different lines. It means that many social and economic disparities exist. The three pillars of sustainable development must therefore be cultivated in a framework that takes into account the very unequal world in which we live. Let me offer you a few thoughts on some of OPEC’s views on the way forward for sustainable development.

Firstly, with regard to fossil fuels, these have played an enormous role in making economic development possible in contemporary industrialised countries and they continue to provide the overwhelming share of energy for the industrialised world today. Furthermore, according to all forecasts, fossil fuels will continue to supply the lion’s share of energy for many decades to come. Therefore, they have a major role to play in sustainable development and providing energy services to the poor. In fact, it must be remembered that just as oil played a key role in fuelling the development of industrialised countries in the 20th century, so it should be given the opportunity to fuel the growth of today’s developing nations.

Secondly, it is industrialised countries that are, and will continue to be, the major global energy consumers. As a result, this needs to be taken into account when considering the issues related to climate change. This, however, does not alter the fact that OPEC Member Countries remain committed to working with all parties to achieve sound and balanced environmental initiatives. Cleaner oil technologies, as well as carbon capture and storage technology, are particularly promising in this regard.

And thirdly, though renewables do and will continue to make a further contribution to the energy mix it is too early to expect these still nascent technologies to provide effective solutions for the developing world.

Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

We must make sure that our voice is heard at next year’s 15th session of the United Nations Commission on Sustainable Development. It is important that we prevent our countries becoming technology laboratories for the benefit of industrialised nations. What we require are cleaner, affordable and proven technological solutions that meet our energy needs. The introduction of new technologies should take into account our countries’ specific requirements and particular circumstances. If not, they could become yet another obstacle to development.

Nevertheless, OPEC does recognise that meeting environmental challenges can provide a great opportunity for all developing countries to leapfrog some of the technology steps that industrialised countries have taken during their industrialisation process. However, they cannot do this without considerable cooperation and assistance from industrialised countries.

The focus is on ‘common, but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities’. Developing countries are collaborating under this principle with the international community to actively seek opportunities to make better and more efficient use of the available energy resources and to develop appropriate technology that contributes to meeting their own developmental needs and interests, whilst at the same time freeing them from any technological dependence that is unsustainable.

Here, however, I must draw your attention to ongoing post-2012 Kyoto Protocol negotiations. We observe that industrialised countries are very actively engaged in stamping out the very essence of what was negotiated at Kyoto; namely the concept that developing countries do not have legally binding commitments to meet with regard to reducing emissions and industrialised countries would ‘take the lead’. Yet it must be recognised that it is highly unlikely that industrialised countries will meet their relatively modest targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before the end of the current commitment period. Not to mention honouring their legally binding commitments toward helping developing countries cope with the impacts of climate change. This should be discussed before any further talk of revising the whole issue of targets and commitments.

Finally, I feel it is also appropriate to briefly express OPEC’s view on the current oil market situation. Given that oil is a very valuable energy source traded globally, it can of course impact upon the prospects for the economic and social progress of developing nations.

In recent months the first question I have been asked is: why are oil prices at their current level? Firstly, I would like to stress that crude volumes entering the market are currently in excess of actual demand, as levels of stocks are at comfortable levels. There is no shortage of supply.

So what are the key drivers impacting the oil price? Today, there is strong economic growth in both rich industrialised countries and in the developing world. According to OPEC, for 2006, the estimate for global economic growth is 4.7%. There is also much downstream tightness due to a lack of refining investment from consuming countries over many years, exacerbated by the rising new and tighter product specifications, particularly in major consuming countries. Set alongside these drivers are unwarranted geopolitical tensions around the world, which are contributing to sharply increased speculative activity in the futures markets, evidenced by the phenomenal growth in hedge and pension funds in particular.

What needs to be understood, however, is that OPEC remains unswerving in its commitment to stabilise the market at prices fair to both consumers and producers.

It is clear that energy has, does and will continue to play an important role in sustainable development, especially in alleviating the alarming disparities that exist between the countries of the North and those of the South. The way forward is through dialogue and cooperation, between all nations of both the developed and developing world. Only then can there be a consensus that takes on board the key sustainable development priorities, with poverty eradication at the core.

We sincerely hope that the past day and a half has reaffirmed the solidarity that OPEC shares with the G-77 & China in this regard, and we welcome any further joint activities that foster stronger integration towards this common goal.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/301-9-june-2006.html"
"2006-06-07","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

On behalf of the OPEC Delegation, I should like to thank His Excellency Dr Martin Bartenstein for his warm words of welcome. I should also like to express my appreciation to all those people from both organizations who have worked so hard to organise today’s meeting — in the case of the EU, under the direction of His Excellency Mr Andris Piebalgs, the European Commissioner for Energy. I am, moreover, delighted to have the opportunity to meet His Excellency Mr Mauri Pekkarinen, the Minister of Trade and Industry of Finland, which will assume the Presidency of the EU on 1 July.

When I met Dr Bartenstein earlier this year in Vienna, shortly after Austria had assumed the EU Presidency, we reflected upon the good progress that had been made with the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue up to that time. Dr Bartenstein assured me that Austria would intensify this process during his country’s Presidency. This was especially pleasing to me, because Austria has been the host nation of the OPEC Secretariat for more than four decades and we have enjoyed a cordial and constructive relationship throughout this period.

And so here we are today in Brussels, at the third meeting of the Energy Dialogue, and the President of the EU Energy Council has been true to his word! We need only look at the range of items on today’s agenda to see how far the dialogue has moved forward since the second meeting in December last year.

On the first anniversary of the dialogue this week, the topics before us relate to long-term strategies, the proposed energy technology centre, carbon capture and storage, energy policies, refining and the financial markets. This is in addition to reviewing developments in oil and energy markets — a sine qua non on such occasions as this.

These matters are all of high relevance to the oil market today and there are concrete plans within this Energy Dialogue to pursue them all in-depth — in most cases, with specific dates and venues.

Long-term strategy will be very much to the fore in today’s meeting, in the light of the EU’s release of its landmark green paper on a “European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy” three months ago. In reading through this important document, our analysts have identified many areas in common with our own Long-Term Strategy which was adopted six months earlier, with regard to the challenge of meeting rising energy demand in the future in a manner that accommodates the needs of socioeconomic development and is in harmony with environmental concerns.

However, there are aspects of the Dialogue where agreement is yet to be reached especially in respect of recent policy announcements. After all, there would be little point in holding this Energy Dialogue if there was total agreement on everything! The same is true with the dialogue into which we have entered with other stakeholders, notably China and Russia.

Thus the purpose of our Energy Dialogue is to see where we stand on particular issues, identify areas of common ground, discuss and seek to narrow differences, and find harmonious corridors of coexistence elsewhere.

Dialogue, of course, has been an ongoing process in other international fora since our last meeting in December. In some cases, these fora have provided opportunities for informal discussions between senior officials from the EU and OPEC, such as at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January and the Tenth International Energy Forum (IEF) in Doha in April. OPEC attaches great importance to the work of the IEF, as the main global platform for producer-consumer dialogue, and, like the EU, through Eurostat, has been heavily involved in the development and launch of the Joint Oil Data Initiative.

OPEC is also committed to meeting broader challenges facing mankind, in particular sustainable development and the eradication of poverty. Recently, top officials from the Secretariat attended the 14th Session on the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in New York, and we are monitoring the progress of this carefully as it enters its 15th Session.

Finally, let me say a few words about the current situation in the international oil market, because this provides the backdrop against which we will be conducting our meeting today.

Last week’s Ministerial Meeting in Caracas saw us extending the agreement we made a year ago at the 136th Meeting of our Conference, maintain the current OPEC-10 production level of 28 million barrels a day. We did this because, even though there is continuing volatility— a situation that concerns us greatly — the market remains well-supplied with oil, fundamentals are in balance and stock levels are comfortable. As is well-known, the present difficulties, which have been with us for around two years and are continuing to put pressure on crude and product prices, have been caused by ongoing tightness in the refining sector, geopolitical developments, speculative activity and other factors.

Against this background, OPEC has been doing its best to ease the situation, and will continue to do so. Our Member Countries have been increasing production — by around four million barrels a day since 2002 — and, where possible, accelerating plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and re-establish a comfortable cushion of spare capacity. OPEC’s production policy has ensured that there should be ample production and spare capacity for years to come. We have also been paying greater attention to the downstream, by increasing investment at home and abroad — even though the refining sector is seen primarily as being the domain of industrialised countries.

All in all, we are not comfortable with prices at the present levels, because they are not supported by fundamentals and contain within them the seeds of further volatility. Extreme price levels, whether too high or too low, are detrimental to both producers and consumers. Our recognition of this fact underlines our longstanding commitment to market stability, so that consumers can receive their oil in an orderly, timely and efficient manner, as and when they need it and at reasonable prices. This perspective also constitutes a central part of our deliberations in the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/302-7-june-2006.html"
"2006-05-19","Thank you Mrs Utseth for those kind words of welcome. For my colleagues and I, it is indeed a pleasure to have the opportunity to visit this beautiful city and I would like to thank our hosts, the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, for making this event possible.

Today’s workshop - the fourth to be held between OPEC and the IEA - reflects how the spirit of cooperation and dialogue has continued to gather pace since the joint initiative was started just a few years ago. It has already proven to be an established forum for improving bilateral relations and promoting a better understanding on a range of important issues. Whereas previous workshops dealt with supply issues, today’s workshop will concentrate on demand. The first workshop, held in Vienna in 2003, looked at oil investment prospects and the needs of the oil sector, while the second workshop, which convened in Paris in 2004, focused on the challenges involved in making the necessary investments available. It also studied the key supply drivers, uncertainties and their implications. Then in Kuwait last year, the third workshop covered the energy outlook and economic prospects for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Our deliberations today – on demand – therefore represent a further step forward for the initiative and give us the opportunity to closely look at another essential element that has a major influence on oil’s future direction. Our objective is to discuss the key issues and prospects for world oil demand and to pinpoint the challenges and uncertainties, both in the near and long term. There are a growing number of obstacles to accurately assessing global oil demand in the short, medium and long term, and we need to look at how these obstacles can be overcome. Our attention should also be drawn to oil consumption patterns and structures in the key growth regions and how they are evolving, as well as the impact of government policies on energy demand.

The OPEC-IEA workshops offer an important platform for brainstorming on such topical subjects as these. They also form an essential element in the dialogue between producers and consumers. I am pleased to note the increasing understanding that has come to characterize relations between consuming and producing nations in recent years. Studying, discussing and generally getting a better understanding of such issues as future growth patterns and how they will impact on supply, demand and prices can only be of benefit to us all in the long run. And as we go forward, it is vital to find a reasonable balance among the different interests of the stakeholders involved – in particular the producers and consumers.

Given the considerable uncertainties that surround today’s global markets, it is of paramount importance that we develop an outlook for demand that accurately reflects the requirements of the oil market in the near- to long-term. Events over the last few years have highlighted the urgent need to assess and reconsider the methodologies being used to forecast world oil demand. And although considerable efforts have been made to develop a more viable alternative to the traditional forecasting methods and models used, these have only met with limited success. Demand forecasting has become even more problematic in recent years, given the increasing share of oil consumption growth in developing countries. A key factor in determining demand growth is the energy policies of consuming countries. For this reason, a good understanding of policy developments and their potential impact on the major demand growth regions is essential for providing a realistic outlook for demand.

Looking ahead, all the forecasts tell us that there should be considerable growth in oil demand over the next 20 years or so – in tandem with expected global economic expansion. However, there are some uncertainties about the rate of this growth. OPEC’s Long Term Strategy (LTS), published last year, highlights the important role oil will continue to play in meeting future global energy demand. But it also warns of the challenges OPEC could face as a result of certain constraints. A major obstacle relates to the uncertainty surrounding future demand for OPEC oil, stemming from world economic growth, the policies of consuming countries, technology development, and the supply capability of non-OPEC producers. The LTS offers three different scenarios that depict how the future might develop taking into account varying degrees of uncertainty. None of these scenarios is set in stone, but it does give us an important indictor as to how uncertainty will continue to be a major influencing force in the oil market in the years ahead. And it is this very uncertainty that can prove so detrimental to all involved in the oil sector, as past experience has shown. For example, putting new capacity in place is an expensive business, so it is essential we acquire sound and reliable data as to what the required level of future world oil demand will be as over-investment is wasteful, just as under-investment could be damaging. Both are costly in their own way.

For years, OPEC has maintained some idle capacity, which has also acted as a cushion in the event of emergencies, such as with the hurricanes last year. Where demand is changing rapidly, OPEC may not be able to know what would be required of it and therefore may not be able to plan with a good degree of accuracy, hence the importance of knowing the needs of consumers.

Given the strong movement seen in energy prices over the past three years, today’s renewed concerns over energy security are not surprising. Yet OPEC has done all that it can to keep prices at reasonable levels, including increasing production by some 4.5 million b/d since 2002. The oil market of today is extremely sensitive. A wide range of factors, even seemingly minor and remote events, can affect the price – even though there is no actual supply shortage. In the upstream, we are doing our best to ensure capacity remains comfortably in line with demand, and things are also moving – albeit very slowly – in relieving the constraints in the downstream refining sector. What is of more concern to us is the effect geopolitics and the accompanying hype and speculation are having on prices. It has been estimated that a premium of up to $15/b is being added to today’s crude price as a result of these factors – factors that have no bearing whatsoever on market fundamentals. We feel that the governments of both the producing and consuming countries must do more to ease these political tensions. It is clear that prices will not fall until these anxieties abate. Every report and study one sees confirms there is absolutely no supply shortage. Just one look at how oil stocks have expanded to five-year highs in 2006 tells us that. The market determines the oil price, and if the fundamentals are in balance, then one has to look elsewhere as to why prices are being inflated. Remove the impediment of geopolitical concerns, tensions, and the resulting speculation and the oil price will find its rightful place in the market.

So what of the future? Well there is every indication that the years ahead will be even more challenging than the past as global demand for energy – especially oil and gas – continues to grow. Just as oil played a key role in fuelling the development of the industrialized countries in the 20th century, OPEC is confident it can play just as important a role in supporting the future growth of the economies of the developing world, where the pinnacle of future oil demand lies. Forecasts drawn up by the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna show that OECD countries will still account for the lion’s share of global oil requirements, but some 80 per cent of the future increase in world crude demand over the next 20 years or so will come from developing countries, whose oil consumption will almost double. With that kind of demand scenario, oil will certainly remain the fuel of choice in the foreseeable future. In fact, fossil fuels will be required to meet more than 90 per cent of the world's total commercial energy needs over the next two decades.

On the supply side, it is generally accepted that non-OPEC producers will not be able to match the demand growth forecast over the next 20 years and OPEC Member Countries will be expected to supply the incremental barrel. In fact, by 2025 OPEC production, including natural gas liquids, could be as high as 54 mb/d, compared with 30 mb/d now. In possessing two-thirds of the world’s crude oil reserves, the Organization has the level of resource base capable of comfortably meeting the increase in demand projected. OPEC Members have already expanded their production capacity – a process that is ongoing and will be adjusted as needs dictate. Current plans will see OPEC’s output capability rising to around 38 mb/d by 2010. That is 5 mb/d more than today. This action is testament to the level of responsibility the Organization attaches to satisfying consumers’ needs, as well as helping to ensure that global economic growth remains on track and is not derailed by any shortage of energy.

I can thus assure you that security of supply is – and will remain – one of OPEC’s top priorities, along with supporting oil market stability. However, security of demand also needs to be guaranteed and for that we require enhanced cooperation from the consuming countries. This entails more than just providing accurate and timely data governing consumers’ energy needs. We need to progress to the next stage where future dialogue is more advanced, more structured and embraces important policy and technical issues. It should also be widened to encompass the views of other oil industry players, such as the national and international oil companies and oil service firms, who also have a significant bearing on oil’s future direction. Determining predictability of supply and demand is essential for taking the industry forward in an orderly and structured fashion. It is the reason OPEC has been continually professing the need for regular and meaningful dialogue among producers, and between producers and consumers. We truly see this approach as being the key to forging a better understanding of the interrelated issues and problems facing us all. By holding such workshops as this one, we are able to discuss the major issues and challenges facing us today and in the future. This provides more transparency concerning our respective aims and aspirations, and gives us the knowledge and understanding that will hopefully guide us in making the right policy decisions in the years ahead.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/303-19-may-2006.html"
"2006-05-14","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

As recently as three years ago, few people, if any, would have predicted the turn of events we have subsequently witnessed in the international oil market.

[Slide 2] Oil prices have more than doubled during this period, there is much uncertainty about their future movements and there has been a need to revise perceptions about the true state of the market and of the oil industry generally. The world economy, however, has also shown surprising resilience to the high price environment.

Nevertheless, it should be noted that, in real terms, prices are still well below the levels of the early 1980s,when the OPEC Reference Basket would have reached US $85 a barrel, at today’s prices. Also, we should not forget that, over the last two years, there has been a strong increase in non-energy commodity prices, sometimes at rates greater than that of oil. This is an often overlooked fact.

It should also be recalled that petroleum-exporting countries suffered from very low oil prices just seven-to-eight years ago, when the OPEC Basket fell to as low as $10/b. Today, these countries are recovering and, at the same time, reinvesting large amounts of capital to increase their production capacity. However, petroleum-importing developing countries are facing larger energy import bills and this is a matter of much concern to us.

We clearly recognise in OPEC that extreme price levels, whether too high or too low, are detrimental to both producers and consumers, and this recognition underlines our longstanding commitment to market stability.

[Slide 3] Our actions reflect this commitment. The market remains well-supplied with crude, as, indeed, has been the case throughout the present volatile period. This has owed much to the decisions and actions of OPEC, whose Members have, where possible, increased production and accelerated plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and re-establish a comfortable level of spare capacity [Slide 4]. As a result, stocks have been increasing to levels above their five-year average.

[Slide 5] As is already well-known in the industry and particularly here in the Middle East, a convergence of factors has caused the volatility and rising prices. There have been; the exceptionally strong economic growth and, in turn, oil demand growth, especially in developing countries; the slow-down in non-OPEC supply growth; tightness in the downstream sectors of major consumer countries; geopolitical concerns; major natural disasters; and heightened levels of speculative behaviour.

How far will all of this go?

[Slide 6] Turning first to oil demand, the OPEC reference case scenario forecasts a 30 mb/d rise in demand by 2025, to reach 113 mb/d. This is an annual average rise of 1.5 mb/d. Consumption of the incremental barrel will be dominated by the developing countries, in particular, Asian countries. By 2025, we expect Asian oil demand to rise by 17 mb/d. Despite this growth, by 2025, OECD countries will remain the dominant oil consumer, and the United States of America, for example, will continue to use five times more energy per person than China.

[Slide 7] From the supply perspective, let me first say that the resource base is sufficient to satisfy expected world oil demand for decades to come. Non-OPEC supply will continue to increase, in particular over the next five years, and is eventually expected to reach a plateau after 2015. Thus, most of the new demand will be met by non-OPEC in the short-to-medium term and by OPEC in the longer term. By 2025, OPEC production, including natural gas liquids, will reach 54 mb/d, according to these projections. However, even then, non-OPEC countries will still account for the larger part of world production.

There are two important observations to make here.

[Slide 8] First, large uncertainties are associated with the future levels of demand for OPEC oil. Security of demand is, indeed, a matter of genuine concern for OPEC. We face a heavy burden of risk, especially since investment requirements in the oil industry are very large and are subject to long lead-times and pay-back periods.

[Slide 9] For example, as shown in this slide, for the period up to 2020, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of as high as $240 billion for the required investment, which is an enormous sum, even when spread over a decade and a half.

Uncertainties over future oil demand growth stem from a number of factors, including economic, energy and environmental policies in consuming countries, as well as technological progress.

More transparency and predictability are, therefore, essential in the evolution and implementation of policies and how they will affect future demand growth. This is why we have been calling for a ""road-map"" for oil demand, to reflect the need for security of demand as a legitimate concern for producers. Security of supply and security of demand must go hand in hand at all times.

Reflecting on the volatility of the past two years, it is clear that there is much greater awareness in the industry at large about the need to invest more heavily in the downstream sector — especially since, in the coming decade, a rising volume of crude oil will need to be refined and there will be a continuation of the trend towards lighter, cleaner products.

A more orchestrated effort is required, therefore, to ensure that sufficient capacities are in place in the future in the downstream. Even though our Member Countries are traditionally associated more with the upstream, they have themselves taken the initiative to invest in downstream projects, on their own and in partnership with others. However, this does not escape the fact that the primary responsibility for investment in this sector lies with the richer nations. Needless to say, the uncertainties over future demand growth also apply to the downstream.

[Slide 10] Let me say at this point that continued scaremongering among certain members of the international community only has the effect of talking-up prices and increasing volatility. OPEC has repeatedly given assurances about security of supply and the history of our Organization fully supports our commitment in this regard. It is written into the OPEC Statute and rigorously adhered to at all times.

As far as speculation is concerned, this cuts both ways. There has been much discussion over the true impact of speculation on the recent volatility and rising prices, but the general feeling is that it has been substantial. Like all markets, the international oil market is cyclical in nature and, when it eventually turns, speculation is almost certain to magnify the downward trend. Once again, the industry should be prepared to address this issue as it arises.

Finally, in the short time available for me to speak, I have focused on the international oil market, because this is OPEC’s principal area of interest. Our Organization, however, also possesses around half the world’s proven natural gas reserves and, as you know, many of our Members are already highly active in this sector.

With regard to the impact of recent market developments on Arab countries, I hope one of my distinguished fellow panellists will elaborate upon this important issue. I have just four general — and brief! — observations to make, which also, incidentally, apply to oil-producing developing countries worldwide.

[Slide 11] First, while many Arab countries are receiving higher revenues from their oil and gas sales, this is not the case for all of them, since some are not producers. For example, only around three-fifths of the members of the League of Arab States produce more than 100,000 b/d of crude, although, in total, the League accounts for nearly a third of world output.

Secondly, the increased revenues have provided oil and gas producers with the opportunity to give added impetus to their economic and social development, with particular regard to diversifying their domestic infrastructures away from such heavy dependence on hydrocarbons. This has had a positive impact on neighbouring countries, in particular by providing much-needed job opportunities.

Thirdly, the higher revenues have also enabled many producers to increase their investment overseas, particularly in the petroleum industry. There is also a greater capability to assist other developing countries.

And fourthly, the recent market developments have underlined emphatically that two areas require much greater attention from producers — the downstream and the Asian market, particularly India and China.

[Slide 12] Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/304-14-may-2006.html"
"2006-05-11","Energy is fundamental for sustainable development. While the use of all forms of energy is welcome, it is clear that fossil fuels will continue to satisfy the lion’s share of the world’s growing energy needs for decades to come.

Since its establishment in 1960, OPEC has committed itself to market stability and to ensuring an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers. Recently, it has accelerated its capacity expansion plans, despite significantly rising costs, to help meet future demand for its oil and offer an adequate level of spare capacity, for the benefit of the world at large.

In addition to this, OPEC and its Member States have also taken an active interest in the economic development and social progress of other developing countries for decades, as well as in environmental issues and the production of cleaner, safer oil.

The Organization established the OPEC Fund for International Development in 1976, with the mandate to “reinforce financial cooperation between OPEC Member Countries and other developing countries and promote South-South solidarity”. To date, the OPEC Fund has committed nearly US $8 billion in grants and loans. The OPEC Fund is, indeed, one of eight multilateral financial institutions that are now either exclusively or largely financed by OPEC Member Countries, and there are, in addition, many bilateral OPEC aid institutions.

Moreover, bearing in mind the need for environmental protection, OPEC considers that it is only realistic to promote cleaner fossil fuel technologies, including carbon capture and storage. It has consequently joined the IEA Greenhouse Gas Research and Development collaborative Programme as well as the Global Gas Flaring Reduction public-private partnership.

In line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, OPEC considers that industrialised countries should take the lead in the development of cleaner fossil fuel technologies, in particular in funding and executing large carbon capture and storage demonstration projects. The Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol should also be adapted to facilitate the application of cleaner fossil fuel technologies in developing countries.

OPEC welcomed the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 and its Plan of Implementation. It is following, with keen interest, the proceedings of the 14th Session of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development.

OPEC maintains that, in order for the session to be conducted and concluded in a fair and balanced manner, the legitimate interests of oil-exporting developing countries, which supply the world with a very valuable and non-renewable natural resource, should be considered at all times — as, indeed, should those of all other developing countries that are suppliers of raw materials to the industrialised world. Therefore, we believe that the following protocols should be observed.

First, energy for sustainable development should be viewed in the context of the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Joint Plan of Implementation.

Secondly, a comprehensive balance between the three pillars of sustainable development — economic development, social progress and environmental protection — should be maintained. Concurrently, the four thematic clusters — energy for sustainable development; industrial development; air pollution/atmosphere; and climate change — should be considered in an integrated manner and within the context of the three pillars.

Thirdly, the evaluation of energy sources should be undertaken in accordance with balanced criteria: reliability, affordability, economic viability, social acceptance and environmental soundness. Furthermore, access to energy and energy services should be the overriding concern for developing countries, and not the source of the energy.

The outright and emotional discrimination against oil in particular and fossil fuels in general is unrealistic. The challenges of energy security, energy poverty, climate change and sustainable development can only be overcome through a comprehensive and balanced approach.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/305-11-may-2006.html"
"2006-05-04","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organizers for inviting me to deliver this keynote address before this distinguished panel at the Offshore Technology Conference, which is one of the premier global oil industry events. “Energy leadership and outlook” conjures up ideas of responsibility, insights, competence, readiness for action and a host of other attributes aimed at ensuring that the consumer receives his energy in a secure and orderly manner and at reasonable prices. This has certainly been OPEC’s objective and guiding principle since our Organization was established 45 years ago.

(Slide 2) In my presentation today, I shall first look at the recent market behaviour, explore the main reasons behind the rising oil prices, and explain OPEC’s response. I shall then turn to the longer-term outlook, emphasising the need not only for security of supply, but also for its mirror image, security of demand. This applies along the entire supply chain, including the downstream.

(Slide 3) As you know, oil prices have reached historic highs over the past fortnight. The price of OPEC’s Reference Basket has risen above US $65 a barrel, which means it has doubled in around two years. Nevertheless, in real terms, prices are still well below the levels seen in the early 1980s, when the OPEC Basket would have reached $85/b, at today’s prices. We should also not forget that, over the last two years, there has been a strong increase in non-energy commodity prices, sometimes at rates greater than that of oil. This is an often overlooked fact.

Today’s oil price movements have been influenced by a convergence of factors.

(Slide 4) First and foremost, oil demand growth has been exceptional. Fuelled by high economic growth, global oil demand surged in 2004 by 2.9 million barrels a day. Such a high level of demand growth has not been seen since the early 1970s. North America and the developing countries, in particular China, were at the centre of this remarkable spurt. It moderated somewhat during 2005, with demand growing by just under 1 mb/d.

(Slide 5) There has also been a slow-down in the rate of expansion of non-OPEC supply. This is, in part, a delayed reaction to the lower oil prices witnessed at the end of the 1990s, with the commensurate stalling of expenditure on exploration and development gradually being felt.

(Slide 6) Next, there has been tightness in the downstream sector. In three key regions of the world — Asia, Europe and the United States — refineries have been operating at 90 per cent of capacity and above for much of the time. In this situation, any disruption can create product shortages — whether from a maintenance shutdown or an emergency such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. There is also a lack of capacity to process heavier sour crudes, causing the prices of light sweet crudes to climb even higher and the differentials between crude grades to increase. All these factors have contributed to downstream tightness, a situation that, based on the information available today, OPEC does not expect to ease in the near term.

(Slide 7) Also influencing price movements has been increasing activity in the futures market, with a new inflow of capital movements by hedge and pension funds. Indeed, open interest contracts in the NYMEX passed the one million mark for the first time just last week. Add to this mix natural disasters and uncertainties stemming from other disruptive events across the globe, and it is understandable why there is so much volatility at the present time.

(Slide 8) OPEC has been responding as necessary to the need for additional oil, underlining its continued commitment to achieving market stability. Indeed, OPEC’s Member Countries have increased production by around 4.5 mb/d since 2002. Despite the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita late last summer, OPEC’s assurances of healthy supply helped prevent that supply interruption from developing into a major crisis. Moreover, in September 2005, OPEC additionally agreed to make available to the market spare capacity of around two million barrels a day in Member Countries, should it be called for. On top of this, further increases in OPEC capacity are being implemented. It should be noted that, at all times, the market has been well supplied with crude oil.

(Slide 9) These actions are fully in line with OPEC’s longstanding objectives, as set out in the OPEC Statute in 1961. In addition to ensuring the stabilisation of prices in international oil markets, with a view to eliminating harmful and unnecessary fluctuations, OPEC aims to secure an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry.

(Slide 10) Looking at the United States, where gasoline prices have surged, we see that crude oil stocks have increased to their highest levels since 2001. Gasoline stocks, on the other hand, are declining, for several reasons. First, there has been a heavy refinery maintenance schedule in the first part of this year. Secondly, and more importantly, the introduction of new specifications and the removal of the use of MTBE have created additional tightness in the downstream and more costs, in particular given the high price of ethanol and the logistical difficulties in transporting it. In addition to federal and state taxes, the diversity of specifications has created niche gasoline markets and made gasoline less fungible.

There is a need for harmonisation between environmental and energy policies. All actions that could help alleviate the upward pressure on gasoline prices, while taking into account the long-term perspective and the need for incentives to invest in the downstream, are very much welcome.

Let me now say a few words about the future, because OPEC is as committed to market stability in five, ten or 15 years’ time as it is today.

(Slide 11) Turning first to oil demand, the reference case scenario contained in OPEC’s World Energy Model forecasts a 30 mb/d rise in demand by 2025, to reach 113 mb/d. This is an annual average rise of 1.5 mb/d. Consumption of the incremental barrel will be dominated by the developing countries, in particular, Asian countries. By 2025, we expect Asian oil demand to rise by 17 mb/d. Despite this growth, by 2025, OECD countries will remain the dominant oil consumer and the USA will continue to use five times more energy per person than China.

(Slide 12) From the supply perspective, let me first say that the resource base is sufficient to satisfy expected world oil demand for decades to come. Non-OPEC supply will continue to increase, in particular over the next five years, and is eventually expected to reach a plateau after 2015. Thus, most of the new demand will be met by non-OPEC in the short-to-medium term and by OPEC in the longer term. By 2025, OPEC production, including natural gas liquids, will reach 54.3 mb/d, according to these projections. However, even then, non-OPEC countries will still account for the larger part of world production.

(Slide 13) Is sufficient investment being made today? The answer is: yes. OPEC crude capacity expansion plans already in place are expected to result in almost 38 mb/d of crude capacity by the end of 2010, an increase of nearly 5 mb/d. This is in spite of the current high costs, which, in turn, have arisen, at least in part, due to shortages, in particular in services and human resources, following the period of low prices witnessed late last century. Similarly, production capacity of natural gas liquids and other liquids continues to rise. This capacity growth is underpinned by more than 100 projects totalling $100 billion. These projects are in addition to energy infrastructure investment. This investment is expected to further increase OPEC’s spare capacity to 5–8 mb/d over the next five years.

(Slide 14) However, there are both upside and downside oil demand scenarios, as shown here. The difference between the demand forecasts in the reference case scenario and the low-growth scenario is 10.5 mb/d in 2025. This translates into an uncertainty of 10.5 mb/d of demand for OPEC oil.

While technologies and policies create uncertainty, most of the risk is on the downside. For example, since so much of the new demand will come from the transportation sector, technologies that improve vehicle fuel efficiencies could have a large downward impact on oil demand growth. Policies that discriminate against oil, such as those promoting biofuels, could also have an impact.

(Slide 15) What does this uncertainty in oil demand mean for OPEC? This graph shows the cumulative OPEC investment in new oil capacity for each of the three scenarios shown on the previous slide. By 2015, the range for oil demand results in an uncertainty range for OPEC investment of $150–290 billion. By 2020, the range increases to between $230 and $470 billion! This uncertainty places a huge amount of risk on OPEC Member Countries. If these countries invest at the top of the range, and the demand does not materialize, then collectively our Organization will end up sitting on billions of dollars’ worth of unused capacity. Such a scenario would be highly detrimental to OPEC countries that have other priorities for investing their oil revenues, such as their economic and social development. It would also put downward pressure on oil prices.

(Slide 16) The investment challenge, however, extends along the entire supply chain. The downstream sector is a very important part of that chain, with current tightness in the form of inadequate refining capacity putting much pressure on oil prices generally. Several factors will shape developments in this sector in the coming decade: the rising volume of crude oil that needs to be refined, the expectation of a continued move towards demand for lighter products, and the trend of product specifications towards significantly cleaner products. On top of the need for further distillation and conversion capacity, it is estimated that additional desulphurisation capacity of more than 20 mb/d will be required over the next ten years. The downstream sector will require significant investment to address these challenges.

(Slide 17) It is estimated that about $160 bn in capacity investment will be required by 2015, with another $150 bn needed for maintenance and replacement of lost capacity. These estimates do not include the infrastructure required beyond the refinery gate, such as pipelines and terminals. However, analysis of available data indicates that investment in the refining sector is coming at a much slower pace than this.

A more orchestrated effort is clearly required to ensure that sufficient capacities are in place in the future. There is, therefore, a pressing need for ways to be explored that could accelerate expansion plans. Most importantly, it should be recognised that the primary responsibility for investment in the downstream sector lies with consuming countries.

Finally, ladies and gentlemen,

(Slide 18) Energy security is a fundamental issue. And security of supply and security of demand are mutually dependent. But energy security applies across the supply chain. Moreover, we should never lose sight of the fact that energy security applies to all nations of the world, and that the central issue of energy poverty eradication requires urgent attention. If we turn our minds back the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, we will recall that poverty eradication is the first UN Millennium Development Goal. A comprehensive and balanced approach to the three pillars of sustainable development is required, for economic growth, social progress and protection of the environment.

The way forward is through dialogue and cooperation among all players. To this end, OPEC continues to devote much effort in this direction, with dialogue now being widened and deepened in an open and constructive manner. Three major advances were made last year with the establishment of energy dialogues between OPEC and, respectively, the European Union, China and Russia. Only last week, representatives from oil-producing and -consuming countries, and major international oil companies, held a high-level stakeholders’ meeting at the specialist producer-consumer body, the10th International Energy Forum (IEF), in Doha, in order to discuss at length the latest developments affecting the industry. At the end of last week, we hosted in Vienna a very enlightening Roundtable between OPEC and China, with representatives from both governmental level and from the industry.

An important and very practical outcome of the IEF has been the launch of the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI) by six intergovernmental organizations, including OPEC, with the aim of releasing more complete and timely data. OPEC considers the JODI initiative to be an essential tool for improving efficiency and transparency in the oil market — indeed, this was also recognised by the Group of Seven industrialised countries, when they met on 21 April.

Energy leadership has many sides to it, as I noted at the beginning of this keynote address. I hope I have successfully managed to enlighten you on the efforts that OPEC makes to bring about order and stability in the international market, to the benefit of producers and consumers alike and in support of sound growth across the global economy.

(Slide 19) Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/306-4-may-2006.html"
"2006-04-23","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

We welcome the opportunity to address the distinguished participants at the 10th International Energy Forum and to present a summary of the OPEC Secretariat’s background paper on the oil outlook to 2025.

In doing so, we shall seek to reaffirm OPEC’s longstanding commitment to oil market stability, as embodied both in the OPEC Statute and the recently released OPEC Long Term Strategy. Energy security is a highly topical issue, and we concur with the organisers of the Forum that it must be directly linked to the idea of it being a shared responsibility.

(Slide 2) It is important that we clarify what the term ‘global energy security’ actually means. First and foremost, security of supply and security of demand are two sides of the same coin. Moreover, the concept of energy security should apply to the entire supply chain and cover all foreseeable time-horizons. For all consumers and producers in this increasingly interdependent world, security resides in the stability of the entire market, to the benefit of rich and poor nations alike.

(Slide 3) Since the 9th IEF, energy and non-energy commodity prices have risen to unexpectedly high levels, leading to renewed concerns over energy security. In May 2004, the OPEC Reference Basket price stood at US $36 a barrel, but, by today, it has risen in nominal terms to over $65/b. We should remember, however, that, in real terms, prices have been far lower than the levels seen in the early 1980s, when the OPEC basket reached over $85/b in today's prices.

These movements have been influenced by a convergence of factors: the exceptionally strong economic and, in turn, oil demand growth, especially in developing countries, with a global increase of 5.4 mb/d over the three years to 2005; tightness in the downstream sector, where utilisation rates have exceeded 90% in most regions; and speculative behaviour - indeed, contract volumes for crude oil on the NYMEX have almost doubled since 2003. Add to this mix major natural disasters plus uncertainties that stem from other disruptive events, and it is understandable why concern about energy security has intensified. However, no supply shortages have appeared; to the contrary stocks have been increasing to levels above their five year average, with OECD commercial stocks at almost 2600 million barrels at the end of 2005.

(Slide 4) OPEC has responded to the need for additional oil, confirming its continued commitment to supporting global energy security. Indeed, OPEC's Member Countries have increased production by around 4.5 million barrels a day since 2002. Despite the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita late last summer, OPEC's assurances of healthy supply — accompanied by similar positive statements from the International Energy Agency — helped prevent that supply interruption from developing into a major crisis.

Moreover, further increases in OPEC capacity are being implemented, something that I shall return to in a moment.

Allow me then to turn to the longer-term outlook.

(Slide 5) First, demand for energy will clearly continue growing. Fossil fuels will continue to meet more than 90 per cent of the world's total commercial energy needs. Oil is expected to continue to be in the leading position in meeting the world’s growing energy needs, accounting for close to 40% of energy demand over the next two decades. Gas demand is expected to continue growing at a fast rate, steadily increasing share from 24% now to over 28% by 2025.

(Slide 6) Turning specifically to oil demand, our reference scenario sees oil demand rise by 30 mb/d over the next 20 years, reaching 113 mb/d by 2025. This is under the assumption that no particular departure in trends for energy policies and technologies takes place. Although developing countries are set to account for most of this rise, with consumption almost doubling, from 29 mb/d to 53 mb/d, OECD countries will continue to account for the biggest proportion of world oil demand.

Asian countries are expected to account for a rise of 17 mb/d, which represents two-thirds of the increase in all developing countries.

Nevertheless, energy poverty will remain an important issue over this period: by 2025, developing countries will consume, on average, five times less oil per person, compared with OECD countries.

The transportation sector will be the main source of future oil demand growth. Of course, the potential for increases in vehicle ownership is greatest in developing countries. Nevertheless, the level of ownership per capita in developing countries will remain well below that of OECD countries. This is an even more evident portrayal of the expected persistence of energy poverty.

(Slide 7) From the supply perspective, the resource base is sufficient to satisfy expected world oil demand growth for decades to come. Estimates of global ultimately recoverable reserves for conventional oil have been increasing, due to such factors as technology, successful exploration and enhanced recovery from existing fields. Indeed, as can be seen from the figure, USGS estimates of Ultimately Recovery Reserves have practically doubled since the early 1980s, from just 1700 billion barrels to over 3300 billion barrels. On top of this, there is a vast resource base of non-conventional oil to explore and develop.

(Slide 8) The number of non-OPEC countries producing oil has risen substantially in recent years. In the medium term, total non-OPEC output has the potential to grow substantially; in the period 2005–10, our projections show 6 mb/d growth.

Russia and the Caspian region will lead non-OPEC growth, while outside these areas, supply increases will be driven primarily by increases in the Gulf of Guinea and offshore Latin America, as well as non-conventional oil in North America. Non-OPEC supply is eventually expected to reach a plateau after 2015, at 58–59 mb/d.

In the longer term, it is therefore expected that OPEC will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel of demand. By 2025, OPEC production levels, including natural gas liquids, rise to 54 mb/d. However, even then, non-OPEC countries will account for the larger part of world oil production.

These projections underline the need for substantial investment along the entire hydrocarbon supply chain. Up to 2025, total upstream investment requirements in our reference case over the next 20 years amount to $1.9 trillion (in 2005 dollars). The global scale of upstream investment that this reference case outlook implies, however, is not expected to be greater in magnitude than that witnessed in the past, because of the gradual shift from higher-cost non-OPEC to lower-cost OPEC supply. Nevertheless, oil prices must be sufficient to mobilise the resources to supply the market with the necessary oil.

(Slide 9) Are these investments being made today? The answer is: yes. OPEC crude capacity expansion plans already in place are expected to result in almost 38 mb/d of crude capacity by the end of 2010, an increase of nearly 5 mb/d. This is in spite of the high costs currently prevailing, which in turn have arisen, at least in part, due to shortages, in particular in services and human resources, following the period of low prices witnessed just a few years ago. Similarly, production capacity of NGLs and other liquids continues to rise. This capacity growth is underpinned by more than 100 projects totalling $100 billion. Moreover, these projects are in addition to energy infrastructure investments. This investment is expected to further increase OPEC spare capacity to 5-8 mb/d over the next five years.

This demonstrates the seriousness OPEC attaches to the need for security of energy supply.

(Slide 10) Nevertheless, the need for enhanced energy security has to be seen from both the supply and demand perspectives. Uncertainty over future demand translates into large uncertainties over the amount of oil that OPEC Member Countries will eventually need to supply, signifying a heavy burden of risk. Investment requirements are very large and subject to long lead-times and pay-back periods. Over the next 15 years, for example, our scenarios show that the amount of oil required from OPEC could range by close to 10 mb/d. With more transparency in the evolution and implementation of policies, better assessments can be made to undertake the appropriate capacity expansion and not waste precious financial resources.

This is particularly valid because downside risks to demand are more substantial than upside potential.

(Slide 11) Uncertainties over future oil demand translate into a wide range of possible levels of necessary investment in OPEC member countries. Even over the medium term to 2010, there is an estimated range of uncertainty of $50 billion for required investment, increasing to $140 billion by 2015, and as much as $240 billion by 2020.

The issue of security of demand is, therefore, a genuine one. Without the confidence that demand for OPEC oil will emerge, the incentive to undertake investment can be reduced. The possible emergence of large levels of unused capacity would put downward pressure on oil prices. This would result in huge revenue losses, and OPEC’s Member Countries, as developing countries with strong competing needs for financial resources, would be adversely affected in terms of available resources for education, healthcare, infrastructure, and so on.

(Slide 12) The investment challenge, however, extends along the entire supply chain. The downstream sector is a very important part of that chain, with current tightness in the form of inadequate refining capacity putting much pressure on oil prices generally. Several factors will shape developments in this sector in the coming decade: the rising volume of crude oil that needs to be refined, the expectation of a continued move towards demand for lighter products, and the trend of product specifications towards significantly cleaner products. On top of the need for further distillation and conversion capacity, it is estimated that additional desulphurisation capacity of more than 20 mb/d will be required over the next 10 years. The downstream sector will require significant investment to address these challenges.

(Slide 13) It is estimated that about $160 billion in capacity investment will be required by 2015, with another $150 billion needed for maintenance and replacement of lost capacity. These estimates do not include the infrastructure required beyond the refinery gate, such as pipelines and terminals. However, analysis of available data indicates that investment in the refining sector is coming at a much slower pace than this.

A more orchestrated effort is clearly required to ensure that sufficient capacities are in place in the future. There is, therefore, a pressing need for ways to be explored that could accelerate expansion plans. Most importantly, it needs to be recognised that the primary responsibility for investment in this sector lies with consuming countries.

(Slide 14) Beyond the investment challenge, a critical question is whether the increasing use of fossil fuels is consistent with the “third pillar” of sustainable development, namely the protection of the environment. Firstly we should note that the oil industry has a long history of successfully improving the environmental credentials of oil, addressing concerns of local pollution and improving air quality. These improvements are expected to continue in the future. Attention therefore turns to concerns over possible climate change. Most energy scenarios project a substantial increase in CO2 emissions throughout this century. Since well over half the emissions are attributable to power stations and industrial activities, these sectors, therefore, constitute prime targets for emission reduction efforts.

Technological options that allow the continued use of oil and gas in a carbon-constrained world must be considered. One promising example is carbon capture and storage, which could represent an affordable means of responding to climate change concerns. Industrialised countries, having the financial and technological capabilities, should take the lead in this area, by promoting large-scale demonstration projects and the application of this technology, including through the use of the Clean Development Mechanism, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.

Finally, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

(Slide 15) Energy security is a fundamental issue. And security of supply and security of demand are mutually dependent. But energy security applies across the supply chain. Moreover, we should never lose sight of the fact that energy security applies to all nations of the world, and that the central issue of energy poverty eradication requires urgent attention. Poverty eradication is the first UN Millennium Development Goal. A comprehensive and balanced approach to the three pillars of sustainable development is required, for economic growth, social progress and protection of the environment.

OPEC firmly believes that the International Energy Forum is a key platform for open, constructive producer-consumer dialogue in the new energy era.

(Slide 16) Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/307-23-april-2006.html"
"2006-04-22","OPEC would like to take this opportunity to assure all delegates attending the IMFC of its continued commitment to maintaining oil market stability, at price levels consistent with healthy economic growth.

Since the last meeting of the IMFC, oil prices have moved higher, with the OPEC Reference Basket having risen above $63/b in mid-April. This price rise occurred despite the fact that the market continues to be well-supplied, with OPEC Member Countries’ production having averaged 29.6 mb/d in March. The healthy situation on the supply side is further demonstrated by OECD crude oil inventories, which are at comfortable levels both in absolute terms and in days of forward cover, while US commercial crude oil stock levels have reached their highest levels in eight years.

These current, high inventory levels show to what extent the market has succeeded in recovering from the disruption in crude and product supplies following the hurricanes in the US Gulf of Mexico last year. This was thanks to the collective measures taken by both consumer and producer countries, including an emergency release of crude and product stocks on the part of the IEA followed by OPEC’s offer to make available its spare capacity of around 2 mb/d.

Last year also underlined the continued resilience of the world economy, as growth was substantial, and rates of core inflation remained under control despite higher oil prices. It is estimated that since 2002 the impact on global GDP of the rise in oil prices has been less than 1%. In 2006, OECD economies are expected to see little impact, as financial conditions remain accommodative, and solid increases in business and household incomes should permit the advanced economies to absorb higher costs. While the impact on developing countries is varied, the healthy momentum of world trade and strong commodity prices can be expected to support growth in most economies. In some cases, the removal of fuel subsidies has pushed up inflation, and poorer economies may suffer from increased balance of payments deficits. In this regard, OPEC is concerned that higher oil prices may affect the prospects of developing countries, and will continue to closely monitor developments. Globally, the world economy is expected to continue its sustained growth in 2006, at a rate similar to that of 2005.

Following the slowdown seen at the end of 2005, oil demand growth is expected to rebound by 1.4 mb/d in 2006, above the average of the last 20 years. The main uncertainties concern the demand forecasts for the USA and China: The USA may continue to experience a weaker growth rate, similar to the one seen in recent months, which resulted from lower demand attributable to the warm winter and high energy prices. In China, however, growth could rise more than expected, following last year’s sharp drop in demand, which was due to improvements in the power generation sector.

On the supply side, non-OPEC production is expected to rebound from last year’s disappointing performance to reach 1.4 mb/d, with the higher trend expected to continue in the near term. The most significant downward risk on the supply side in 2006 continues to be the rate of recovery of production from the US Gulf of Mexico.

The picture on the products side remains tight, given the persistently low levels of refinery spare capacity and more stringent products specifications in the USA. As a result, any shortage caused by technical or logistic problems will continue to have a significant impact on the global market, affecting products prices and, consequently, crude oil prices. Furthermore, the planned phasing out of MTBE, and increased use of ethanol as a blending component, may exert more pressure on the gasoline market, in particular during the summer driving season, which will coincide with the introduction of ultra-low sulphur diesel in the USA.

So far in 2006, the market has been characterized by persistent volatility, with crude oil prices having fluctuated by as much as $10/b. At times the market’s attention is captured by news of unexpected supply outages or geopolitical concerns; then an inventory report is released, reminding the market that physical supplies, particularly of crude oil, continue to exceed demand. Unfortunately the upward rising trend indicates that healthy market fundamentals have been unable to outweigh fears of possible future supply disruptions. To further reassure the market, OPEC has maintained production at a high level, despite the expected seasonal drop in demand in the second quarter.

Since 2004, the traditional approach of using oil inventory levels to assess the relative tightness of the oil market, and thus oil price trends, has been neither accurate nor effective. Despite the continued increase in inventory levels in response to OPEC’s sustained high production, prices have continued to rise, due to a number of factors, mainly persistent downstream bottlenecks, the perception of upstream constraints and ongoing geopolitical concerns. This has fed speculative cycles and increased activity in the futures market, as is reflected by the significant growth in the volume of open interest over the last three years.

As the evolving market situation has eroded the effectiveness of traditional market indicators, there is an urgent need to identify additional indicators that exhibit a more robust relationship with price behaviour, and could, therefore, prove a more reliable indicator of current market direction.

Another key challenge facing the oil market relates to the uncertainties surrounding future demand for oil in general, and for OPEC oil in particular. Areas of uncertainty concern future world economic growth rates, consuming countries' policies, technological developments and future non-OPEC production levels. These uncertainties give rise to a broad range in the estimates for demand for OPEC oil in the years to come, thus greatly complicating the planning for appropriate and timely investments in OPEC Member Countries, and consequently increasing the risks associated with both under- and over-investment. In this regard, OPEC and the IEA are jointly organizing a workshop, to be held next month, to consider the key issues and uncertainties for world oil demand in the coming years.

In the meantime, OPEC Member Countries have been steadily increasing crude production capacity, in order to meet expected growth in demand, not only for the current year, but also for the many years to come. By the end of 2006, OPEC production capacity is expected to have reached 33.3 mb/d, an increase of 1.2 mb/d, while during the period 2006-2010, OPEC production capacity is expected to grow by 5 mb/d.

It should be emphasized that the need for appropriate investment is not confined to the upstream sector, but also extends along the entire supply-chain, particularly in the downstream sector. Given current trends, tightness in the downstream sector can be expected to remain a potential source of volatility, especially if the necessary investment in the refining sector is not undertaken in a timely manner. In this context, OPEC Member Countries have embarked on ambitious programmes of downstream investment, in an attempt to relieve part of the expected market tightness in the coming years, and in the hope that consumer countries and the oil industry in general will rise to the challenge, and carry their share of investments. This week ministers from producer and consumer countries and high representatives from the industry and from international finance are meeting in Doha, at the 10th International Energy Forum, for in-depth discussions regarding the world’s energy issues.

In light of the above challenges, OPEC Member Countries will continue to closely monitor the market, and stand ready to make the timely decisions needed to ensure adequate supplies consistent with robust economic growth. In the pursuit of market stability OPEC continues to strengthen and deepen its cooperative efforts with other stakeholders in the oil industry, in the strong conviction that only through increased dialogue and shared responsibility can the challenges posed by the oil industry be successfully faced.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/308-22-april-2006.html"
"2006-04-07","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for this invitation to present at the 7th International Oil Summit. I see from the list of speakers that this is a highly respected event and I look forward to hearing many more of the presentations today.

Let me start my presentation by offering you a brief review of the last 12 months. During this period we have witnessed, amongst many other things, some major natural disasters with which the market has had to cope at short notice, escalating geopolitical tensions in some parts of the world and periods of extreme cold weather in Europe and Asia. Yet the oil market has been well-supplied with crude, which in part is very much as a result of OPEC’s reasoned, proactive and timely actions in the market.

So the title of this session, the ‘Outlook for Oil Supply/Demand’, offers me an excellent opportunity to look out beyond the past 12 months, review where the oil market currently resides and present OPEC’s views on global supply and demand issues. It is also apt given the recent publication of OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy document that lays out a coherent and consistent framework for the Organization’s future, with the recognition of oil’s importance in meeting future global energy demand and its significance to the future socio-economic development of OPEC Member Countries.

(Slide 2) As you would expect two of the key issues addressed in OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy relate to security of supply and security of demand. Indeed, global energy security is a topic on everyone’s lips today. The increased visibility of energy security was observed at the recent G8 summit talks in Moscow, where the subject was top of the agenda, and it will also be an important topic of discussion at this month’s 10th International Energy Forum in Doha. It is an issue that has a bearing on today and tomorrow; our futures and our children’s futures.

I believe it is necessary at the outset to stress the strong linkage between security of supply and security of demand. In a nutshell, the two are intertwined and one cannot be achieved without the other. It is not just a question of whether there will be enough supply to meet demand; it is a question of whether there will be enough demand to meet current and predicted supply. Thus the basis for ‘global energy security’ is a balanced and mutually supportive supply and demand network. This platform provides the stability from which consumers and producers can develop, build on, and adapt both short- and long-term supply and demand strategies to meet the market’s needs.

(Slide 3) Talk of supply and demand, for any resource-based industry, initially leads to the question of whether the world has enough resources to meet the levels of demand that have been forecast for the coming decades. OPEC’s unequivocal response to this question is undoubtedly: yes. There is no physical shortage of the required resources. This view is shared by a wide variety of respected energy industry institutions. Oil is also expected to maintain its leading position in meeting the world’s growing energy needs for at least the next two decades. All this leads to the question: how will oil supply and demand develop over the short- and long-term?

Short-term, OPEC projects average world oil demand to grow by 1.5 million barrels a day for 2006. North America, especially the US, will contribute the bulk of demand growth within the OECD countries rising by approximately 0.3 mb/d. Demand growth is highest, however, in developing countries where an additional 1 mb/d is expected. Almost 80 per cent of this growth is anticipated to fall in the non-OECD Asian countries and the Middle East region.

(Slide 4) To meet anticipated increases in demand, OPEC Member Countries have already increased production by around 4.5 mb/d since 2002. This has led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks with inventory levels increasing monthly and as of now sit above their five-year average. To meet continued demand growth and to reestablish a comfortable level of spare capacity, where possible, Member Countries have also accelerated plans to bring on-stream new production capacity.

(Slide 5) More increases in capacity have also been planned — and are being implemented — for the rest of the decade. Together with the expected growth in non-OPEC supply and OPEC natural gas liquids, this means that cumulative world liquids production capacity will rise by around 12 mb/d or more over the next five years — well above the expected cumulative rise in demand of 7-to-8 mb/d over the same period. These figures point to significant increases in spare capacity over the coming years. OPEC capacity growth is underpinned by over 100 E&P projects totaling more than $100 billion and is a demonstration of its continued commitment to oil market stability, and security of supply.

There are some who still question whether upstream production is adequate, given that recent price levels have hovered around the $50-to-$60 mark. Though I should point out that in real terms these prices are below those of the early 1980s. So in response to those who suggest constraints in supply are an upstream conundrum I would like to offer up a short vignette. In September 2005, OPEC moved to make available to the market spare capacity of around 2 mb/d, should it be called for, following the US supply disruption. The spare capacity was not required.

Intimation that supply constraints are an upstream concern is not borne out by this recent event. It is more a market perception, than based on any reality. Recent OPEC research has sought to enhance the understanding of what is driving current price levels. Since 2004, the traditional approach to assessing the tightness of the oil market, based on oil inventories as an explanation for oil price movements, has not been applicable. Despite continual rising inventory levels on the back of OPEC’s additional capacity, prices continued to increase in 2004 and 2005. (Slide 6) Research points to downstream tightness, as well as the perception of upstream constraints, which has led to increased activity in the futures market and a significant rise in open interests, namely the number of outstanding contracts for which an entity has not yet made an offsetting sale or purchase. Geopolitical concerns obviously play a role too.

OPEC's Member Countries, although traditionally associated more with the upstream, have themselves taken the initiative to invest in downstream projects; this has been on their own and in partnership with others. Currently, 0.6 mb/d of new refinery capacity is under construction, with an additional 1.9 mb/d planned. However, all of this does not escape the fact that downstream investment is primarily the responsibility of the international oil companies and consuming countries.

Inadequate past investment and increasingly stringent product specifications have been major factors behind this lack of effective global refining capacity and today investments in the refining sector are also coming at a considerably slower pace than is warranted by expected growth in demand. Thus, the downstream sector could very well remain a source of market instability over the coming years.

(Slide 7) As well as these downstream concerns, OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy underlines a number of challenges that may impact future world oil demand, such as world economic growth and expanding vehicle usage, country demographics, consuming countries’ energy and environmental policies and technology development. Questions over how future non-OPEC production might evolve further compounds the uncertainty regarding how much oil will be needed from OPEC to achieve a supply and demand balance. These uncertainties are explored in the Long-Term Strategy by three consistent scenarios, the first of which envisages a future following previous oil demand patterns, with the other two exploring futures leading to lower and higher rates of oil demand growth respectively. The difference between the lower and higher rates of oil demand growth out to 2020 is more than 12 mb/d.

Let me initially focus on global economic growth. This is very much a major unknown and an obvious leading driver for future demand. In recent years, extremes of economic activity have demonstrated the difficulty of assessing what might reasonably be expected to occur over the next 20 years. The average rate of world economic growth in 2004, over five per cent per annum, had not been experienced since the early 1970s, while economic growth in 2005 was the third fastest over the past two decades. On the other hand, as recently as 2001, world economic growth was at its lowest for more than a decade, while 1998 also saw weak global growth in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.

By far the greatest increase in future demand is expected from developing countries. The recent rapid economic growth of countries such as China and India are cases in point. With a combined population approaching 2.5 billion, the two countries have recently witnessed significant demand increases. And in the future demand is expected to rise further.

(Slide 8) For example, in China and India, there are now just 10-to-20 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with more than 500 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in the OECD region. With the transportation sector expected to be the single most important source of demand increase, there is clearly enormous potential for the transport sector growth in these two countries alone. It is important to stress, however, that the OECD region is still expected to be consuming more oil than developing countries by 2025. Moreover, there will remain large differences in consumption per head, with developing countries consuming on average five times less oil per person by 2025 compared to the OECD. It will also be critical to monitor whether developing countries follow similar paths to those already taken by developed countries.

(Slide 9) Yet predicted faster economic growth only offers up the overlying story. The underlying one is that of energy poverty. In the developing world, the lack of basic energy services is a severe impediment to the alleviation of poverty. Halving the proportion of people in the world whose income is less than $1 a day was actually the first declared ‘Millennium Development Goal’. Bringing people out of energy poverty is a focus for us all, and the benefits for those involved are obviously huge. For OPEC, the goal of eradicating poverty is close to the heart of OPEC Member Countries, being developing countries themselves. Yet energy poverty eradication can only be achieved through international collaboration so that these consumers have continuous access to the modern energy services many of us take for granted.

(Slide 10) In the transportation sector further uncertainty stems from the impacts on oil demand of technology development. For example, conventional internal combustion engines could continue to achieve significant fuel economy improvements, while hybrid vehicles may witness a significant growth.

Demand is additionally driven by demographics. The world’s population has risen by almost 10,000 in the last hour and almost 250,000 over the past day. In India over the past 15 years the population has risen by more than 250 million and in China the figure is approximately 160 million. However, as has been witnessed in many developed countries, changing demographic structures may also lead to a drop in the rate of population increases. China is anticipated to have much lower population growth rates in the coming years. All demographic movements, both an acceleration and a slowing, can have a significant impact on demand for oil and exactly how changes in demographic structures will affect oil demand is a further uncertainty.

Oil demand is also greatly affected by consuming countries’ policies. Taxation of energy products is often seen not only as a means of raising revenue, but also a means of controlling demand in addressing environment and energy security issues. Policies demonstrate significant discrimination against oil, involving not only higher tax rates, but also subsidies for competing fuels. Great uncertainty exists in relation to future developments of consuming countries’ policies and is considered one of the main constraints in ensuring adequate security of demand. Scenarios developed at the OPEC Secretariat show that such policies alone could potentially introduce demand uncertainty of the order of 5-to-10 mb/d to 2025.

(Slide 11) At this juncture, with talk of countries' environmental policies, I feel it is appropriate to add a few thoughts on OPEC and the environment. Although OPEC is concerned about the impact of environmental policies from consuming countries, this does not alter the fact that it remains committed to working with all parties to achieve sound and balanced environmental policies that do not undermine the ability of developing countries to pursue their legitimate goals of economic and social advancement.

OPEC also recognises that its Member Countries need to play an active role in addressing climate change concerns and as an Organization welcomes the Kyoto Protocol. Though renewables can and will make a further contribution to the energy mix, their likely limited role for the foreseeable future leads to an expectation of expanded use of fossil fuels, at least over the next few decades. In this light, there is a need to emphasise the role of cleaner fossil fuel technology. In particular, carbon capture and storage is a promising technology that is cost effective and can allow the continued use of fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained world. In conjunction with enhanced oil recovery, it also offers a win-win opportunity. Steps need to be taken to move this and other advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technologies forward.

(Slide 12) Returning to uncertainties, both singularly and taken as a whole these all represent significant challenges. If there is no particular departure from past trends, oil demand might be expected to grow by something of the order of 1.5 mb/d annually over the next two decades. Yet supply and demand of OPEC oil is also impacted on by the development of non-OPEC supply. This further complicates making appropriate and timely investments in OPEC Member Countries. It is anticipated that although non-OPEC supply will continue to expand during this decade and further, it will eventually reach a plateau.

Given the uncertainties, the amount of oil that OPEC is projected to supply over the next 10-to-15 years could range by as much as 10 mb/d or more and somewhere between $230 billion and $470 billion in investment terms. This vast range in oil demand and investment becomes even more acute when taking into account the long lead and pay back times involved and it must also be noted that uncertainties are overwhelmingly skewed to the downside.

(Slide 13) The way forward is dialogue and cooperation. To this end OPEC continues to devote much effort in this direction, with dialogue now being widened and deepened in an open and constructive spirit. As you may know, the most recent result of this was the establishment, last year, of energy dialogues between OPEC and, respectively, the European Union, China and Russia. And as I mentioned earlier, this month producers and consumers will meet at Ministerial level at the 10th International Energy Forum in Doha, in order to discuss at length the latest developments affecting the industry. Indeed, close involvement with the International Energy Forum and the establishment of its Secretariat in Saudi Arabia demonstrates clearly OPEC's commitment to this ongoing process.

(Slide 14) OPEC is committed to ‘global energy security’, both today and in the future and its most recent actions, both upstream and downstream, bear witness to this. This is no empty statement. It needs to also be recognised that the revenues oil-producing countries receive from petroleum sales are essential for financing their economic and social development.

Yet without the confidence that demand for OPEC's oil will emerge, the incentive to undertake investment can be reduced, which, in turn, can exacerbate concerns over eventual sufficiency of capacity in the future, and hamper the drive towards long-term oil market stability. Thus, more transparency and predictability in the evolution and implementation of economic, energy and environmental policies in consuming countries, and how they will affect future demand growth is essential. High-quality, timely information underpins well-functioning markets and today there is a particular need for better data on the evolution of demand and stocks.

As an industry we have to be inclusive: to think and plan ahead and to look at the needs of the world market, not just this year and next, but over the next decade and beyond. That is the timescale on which the industry has to think, and to invest. ‘Global energy security’ and its twin pillars of supply and demand may be checkered with uncertainties, but future market stability resides in all our hands.

"2006-04-03","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for this invitation to present to an audience back in my home country of Nigeria. After spending much of the early part of this year in a cold and snowy Vienna it makes a welcome change to feel the warmth of Abuja.

The topic I have been asked to present on today – ‘Oil Outlook: Challenges and Opportunities’ – offers me a broad remit of possible discussion points: the outlook for oil production and consumption, recent oil price behavior, the importance of cooperation and dialogue, to name a few. However, it is difficult to focus on one particular topic without touching on the over-arching concern of our industry today, that of ‘global energy security’.

(Slide 2) This vital issue is of concern to us all. Here in Nigeria the revenues from oil are essential to the social and economic development of our citizens, as they are in other OPEC Member Countries, all developing nations. Without energy security this much needed revenue is put in jeopardy. For many in the developing world the energy security issue also wraps itself around energy poverty. Let us remember that today, 1.6 billion people in developing countries lack access to modern energy services. I will return to the critical matter of energy poverty later.

In the developed world the issue has also recently reestablished itself high on the political agenda. The increased visibility of energy security was observed at the recent G8 summit talks in Moscow, where the subject was top of the agenda, and it will also be an important topic of discussion at this month’s 10th International Energy Forum in Doha. It is an issue that has a bearing on today and tomorrow; our futures and our children’s futures.

This renewed focus is unsurprising given the recent upwards movement of energy and non-energy commodity prices, speculative behaviour linked to consumer concerns over the near-term availability of spare production capacity, the exceptionally strong economic and in turn oil demand growth of developing countries, particularly China, India and the Middle East, and the tightness in the downstream sector. Add into this mix, major natural disasters with which the market has had to cope with at short notice, and uncertainties that stem from other disruptive events, and it is understandable why concerns have arisen.

With this broad spectrum of issues, however, it is important that we clarify what the term ‘global energy security’ actually means. It is easy to appreciate how it can mean different things to different people, depending on which side of the fence they happen to be sitting.

First and foremost what needs to be understood is that security of supply and security of demand are two sides of the same coin. One cannot be achieved without the other. For all consumers and producers in this increasingly interdependent world, security resides in the stability of the entire market.

Let us look at the issues surrounding security of supply and demand in more detail and underline the means by which OPEC continues to play a positive role in enhancing ‘global energy security’.

A fundamental question arising in the context of global energy security is whether there is enough supply to meet the projected growing demand for oil. OPEC’s answer to this question is undoubtedly: yes. The idea that oil production is soon to peak needs to be dispelled. This view is recognised by a wide variety of respected oil industry sources.

(Slide 3) Over the long-term OPEC will be relied upon to supply most of the incremental barrel demanded, as non-OPEC supply is expected to eventually plateau, and the Organization’s position on security of supply remains the same as it did the day the Organization was formed in Baghdad in 1960. Its very first resolution refers to the assurance of “an efficient, economic and regular supply” of petroleum to consumers. Today this remains at the heart of OPEC’s existence. We need only look at recent responses by the Member Countries to the need for additional oil to confirm this.

First, OPEC's Member Countries have increased production by around 4.5 million barrels a day since 2002. This has, in turn, led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks. (Slide 4) Preliminary data for early 2006 showed levels both above last year and the average for 2001-2005.

Secondly, where possible, our Member Countries have accelerated their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and to reestablish a comfortable level of spare capacity. This spare capacity will be more than adequate to cover oil demand growth throughout this year, when the call on OPEC oil is expected to be slightly lower than in 2005.

(Slide 5) More increases in capacity have been planned — and are being implemented — for the rest of the decade. Together with the expected growth in non-OPEC supply and OPEC natural gas liquids, this means that cumulative world liquids production capacity will rise by around 12 mb/d or more over the next five years — well above the expected cumulative rise in demand of 7–8 mb/d over the same period. This points to significant increases in spare capacity over the coming years. OPEC capacity growth is underpinned by over 100 E&P projects totalling more than $100 billion, which is a demonstration of its long-term commitment to oil market stability, and security of supply.

In addition to these previous and future increases, in September 2005 OPEC also moved to make available to the market spare capacity of around 2 mb/d, should it be called for, following the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes. This decision was made, despite there being ample crude oil supplies with inventory levels lying above their five year average.

(Slide 6) And thirdly, severe downstream bottlenecks in some major consuming countries have been putting pressure not just on product prices, but also crude prices, especially light, sweet blends, at a time when the upstream has been well supplied. Inadequate past investment, increased demand for middle distillates, and increasingly stringent product specifications have been major factors behind this lack of effective global refining capacity. Today investments to the refining sector are also coming at a considerably slower pace than is warranted by expected growth in demand: a more orchestrated effort is clearly required to ensure sufficient capacities are in place in the future.

OPEC's Member Countries, although traditionally associated more with the upstream, have themselves taken the initiative to invest in downstream projects; this has been on their own and in partnership with others. Currently, 0.6 mb/d of refinery capacity is under construction, with an additional 1.9 mb/d planned. However, all of this does not escape the fact that downstream investment is primarily the responsibility of the international oil companies and consuming countries.

To meet future downstream challenges about $160 billion in capacity investment will be required by 2015 and another $150 billion needed for capacity maintenance and replacement of lost capacity. The emerging investment trends suggest that the downstream sector could very well remain a source of market instability over the coming years. It is therefore a pressing area for discussion among all parties, and ways need to be explored that could accelerate expansion plans.

Clearly, such actions, both upstream and downstream, come from an Organization that is committed to security of supply. This involves careful analysis of the market outlook, detailed planning and considerable upfront investment, perhaps diverting funds from other worthy domestic causes, in order to make absolutely sure there is enough oil on the market.

(Slide 7) Turning to security of demand, the mutually supportive partner of security of supply, uncertainty over future oil demand levels translate into a broad range of potential quantities for OPEC oil. Though energy demand is expected to grow, with oil expected to maintain its position as the leading supplier of energy for the next two decades, the levels of demand for OPEC oil may be affected by a variety of drivers. (Slide 8) This includes non-OPEC supply, energy and environmental policies of consuming countries, economic growth, and future technological developments. If there is no particular departure from past trends, oil demand might be expected to grow by something of the order of 1.5 mb/d annually over the next two decades. However, uncertainties are overwhelmingly skewed to the downside. Given the uncertainties, a scenario approach developed at the OPEC Secretariat in the process of developing its Long-Term Strategy suggests that the amount of oil that OPEC is projected to supply over the next 10-to-15 years could range by as much as 10 mb/d or more.

(Slide 9) These uncertainties have of course, huge financial implications and make investment planning a hazardous business given the considerably long lead-times and pay-back periods. By 2015, an estimated uncertainty of $140 billion for required OPEC investment can be envisaged. A range of possible demand and investment scenarios were recently published in OPEC’s Long-Term Strategy document. I should also stress that this $140 billion figure only accounts for upstream investment and would be even higher if we included the development of new infrastructure such as pipelines, storage facilities and ports.

(Slide 10) This clearly demonstrates OPEC's concerns that there is a real risk of wasting much-needed financial resources. Equally important, the emergence of large levels of unused capacity would lead to downward pressures upon oil prices. This would result in a huge loss of revenues, and OPEC Member Countries, as developing countries with keenly felt competing needs for financial resources, would be adversely affected in terms of available resources for such key areas as education, healthcare and infrastructure. Moreover, lower revenues would in turn, negatively affect available resources for future investment, with further subsequent market instability a distinct possibility.

Indeed, without the confidence that demand for OPEC's oil will materialise, the incentive to undertake investment can be reduced, which, in turn, can exacerbate concerns over eventual sufficiency of capacity in the future, and hamper the drive towards long-term oil market stability. It is in this context that there is a call for a ‘road map’ for oil demand.

The shared security of supply and demand perspective stresses the importance that the various oil industry participants – OPEC and non-OPEC, producers and consumers, as well as the international oil companies and other intermediaries – make every effort to collaborate and together reduce uncertainties and share the risks.

(Slide 11) In Africa this is no more important than in the Gulf of Guinea. This region has become the most active exploration and production area for oil and gas in the African continent, and one of the most active in the world. Its significance can be viewed in the formation of the Gulf of Guinea Commission and the number of international investors it attracts. Over the last three years supply from the region has increased by approximately 1.2 mb/d and its source as today’s leading supplier of sweet grades only enhances its global importance.

In fact, today oil exports from the Gulf of Guinea make up approximately 15 per cent of the oil imported by the United States, the world’s largest consumer. This is expected to increase as the United States continues its move towards more stringent product specifications. International collaboration, headed by the Gulf of Guinea nations, will be essential to the continued development of this high quality resource.

(Slide 12) OPEC recognises the value of collective dialogue and cooperation for the enhancement of energy security and continues to devote much effort in this direction, with dialogue now being both widened and deepened in an open and constructive spirit. As you may know, the most recent result of this was the establishment, last year, of energy dialogues between OPEC and, respectively, the European Union, China and Russia. Later this month, producers and consumers will meet at Ministerial level at the tenth International Energy Forum in Doha, in order to discuss at length the latest developments affecting the industry. Indeed, close involvement with the International Energy Forum and the establishment of its Secretariat in Saudi Arabia demonstrates clearly OPEC's commitment to this ongoing process.

A good example of this is JODI, the Joint Oil Data Initiative, in which OPEC has been a leading participant from its inception. High-quality information underpins well-functioning markets and can prove crucial on an everyday level and particularly in crisis, when consumer panics can be instigated by a mixture of actual disruptions, rumours and fear. In such situations, all industry participants should collaborate to counter panics with high-quality, timely information. Of particular note here is the need for better data on the evolution of demand and stocks.

(Slide 13) Finally I would like to return to the critical concern I highlighted at the beginning of my presentation today: that of energy poverty. For many in the world, energy security is not about the pumps being full, the public transport infrastructure ticking over, or the car starting up every morning. It is about having the very basic energy services as a means of alleviating poverty. More than half of the countries of the world have less than one car for every ten inhabitants, while there are many countries, including India and China, but mostly in Africa, where there are only one-to-two cars for every 100 of the population. With 1.1 billion people currently living on less than $1 a day, the World Summit on Sustainable Development declared at the highest level a global commitment to establish a strong link between poverty eradication and sustainable development. In fact, it is poverty eradication that comes first on the list of the eight Millennium Development Goals. What goes hand in hand with this is the eradication of energy poverty.

As I have said, 1.6 billion people in developing countries lack access to modern energy services. In addressing energy security, we must therefore ensure that attention remains firmly focused on the current state of energy poverty in developing countries. The overwhelming needs of developing countries must therefore be seen as an international priority.

In Africa, NEPAD spearheads efforts to alleviate the escalating poverty levels and underdevelopment of the continent. For example, NEPAD is working on increasing savings and capital inflows through further debt relief and is looking to strengthen cooperation between African Governments, multilateral institutions and the private sector. The focus is on sustainable development. Oil as a fuel and a means of generating revenue for worthy economic and social development provides an important contribution to this overriding concern.

Whilst it is essential that Africa has organisations such as NEPAD, it must also be recognised that the developed world must make definite progress in fulfilling the many already existing commitments to developing countries, especially in connection with capacity building and transfer of technology.

The energy security challenges for the oil market are to keep supply and demand working in harmony. The challenge of energy security is not something that will go away. It is something that needs to be thought about continuously. And I might add that these thoughts need to lead to actions. In this regard OPEC’s recent actions have displayed a commitment to these challenges as it looks to maintain market stability. Success in meeting these challenges leads us to a major opportunity: poverty and energy poverty eradication across the world. Energy Security will be fundamental to life for all in the 21st century.

"2006-03-03","Ladies and gentlemen,

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address you at the National Press Club on the current oil market situation and other matters affecting OPEC, its relations with the United States of America, and the world oil industry.

As you know, I am now approaching the end of my three-day visit to Washington DC to meet senior Administration figures, Members of Congress and the Business Community in general, Oil Executives. Even though the visit has had a very tight schedule, I have been able to engage in enlightening and constructive discussions on a wide range of issues that relate to today’s oil market, as well as that of the future, looking to the years and decades to come. OPEC is as committed to the future welfare of the market as it is to the present.

It has certainly been one of those occasions where it has been as important to listen as well as to talk. On occasions like this, we all have much to learn from each other. Here, I am not referring so much to hard facts, although, of course, these are important in their own right. But I am thinking more of perceptions and attitudes. Perceptions and attitudes play a vital role in shaping policy. They require clear mutual understanding among the respective parties if they are to enhance relationships in today’s fast-moving world.

The past two years have been very challenging ones for the oil market, with prices reaching new highs, in a setting of almost persistent volatility. Here I refer to nominal prices, since real prices are still below the levels witnessed in the early 1980s. I have explained to the Honourable Members of the Administration and Congress, as well as to other distinguished audiences, how OPEC has sought relentlessly to stabilise the market in this very difficult situation and to restore prices to levels acceptable to producers and consumers alike.

Along the way, I have pointed out that OPEC has only been able to achieve so much with its actions, since factors over which our Organization has little or no influence have been primarily responsible for the present volatility. Here I refer, in particular, to downstream bottlenecks in some major consuming nations, as well as to excessive levels of speculation, geopolitical tensions, natural disasters and so on.

In OPEC, we have been acting in three main areas, through increasing crude supply to the market, accelerating the construction of new capacity and investing more heavily in the downstream — even though this latter area is traditionally seen as the responsibility of consumers, rather than producers. We have, what is more, adopted such stabilisation measures, even though the market has remained well-supplied with crude during this period. The market is, indeed, well-supplied with crude today, as is clear from the present high stock levels.

We are also optimistic about the future, as I have endeavoured to explain during the course of this visit. The world has enough oil resources to last for generations to come. The challenge today is deliverability — to ensure consumers receive the oil products they need, of the right kind, in the right place and at the right time.

Incidentally, when I refer to consumers, I mean consumers from across the world and not from just the rich industrialised nations. As we saw at the UN World Summit in Johannesburg in 2002, energy services have a central role to play in sustainable development and the eradication of poverty.

There is therefore, no reason why consumers the world over should not receive their oil on a steady, secure and sustainable basis well into this century. However, this requires careful planning and sound investment strategies. Fundamental to this, as I have been explaining this week, is a clear idea of evolving demand patterns — or rather, as much clarity as possible in an inherently uncertain world. Uncertainty makes investment planning a hazardous business in an industry where the stakes are very high, with long lead-times and substantial upfront capital. Needless to say, over-investment implies heavy costs in future idle capacity to be borne by producers, while under-investment has a similarly disruptive effect elsewhere in the market.

One big area where concrete steps can be taken to reduce uncertainties is in consumer government policies. This is why I took every possible opportunity this week to repeat OPEC’s call for greater consistency and clarity in energy policy-making in the industrialised world. Indeed, this is why we have gone to great lengths over the years to encourage dialogue and cooperation throughout the oil world, involving all the major producers and consumers. We all have to work together towards global energy security. This calls for dialogue to create better understanding of competing energy sources and the relative merits of the investment choices that lie before the international community of producers and consumers.

Ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to capture in my remarks the flavour of the discussions in which I have been privileged to be involved here in Washington DC. Of course, the meetings themselves have looked at these and other issues in greater depth.

This has been a most rewarding visit. I have every reason to believe that a basis exists now for dialogue between OPEC, Corporate America and the Administration. At the same time, it has been reassuring to note that a broad consensus exists in Corporate America, if not yet in the Administration, on fossil fuels, in particular, on oil and gas, as the most cost-effective energy sources for the foreseeable future. OPEC wishes to reaffirm its abiding commitment to a clean environment, stable markets and sustained supplies of oil and gas to the global economy, while acknowledging the niche role of longer-term renewable alternatives.

This consensus is important, as, without it, the huge investments needed to expand supply capacity that are going forward — to avoid a repeat of the current market tightness in the upstream and more so in the downstream — cannot be justified.

Thank you for your attention.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/312-3-march-2006.html"
"2006-02-15","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for this timely invitation to address you on the issue of energy security. This important issue has recently re-established itself high on the political agenda in some influential consumer circles, as witnessed just a fortnight ago in the US State of the Union address delivered by President George W. Bush.

What lies behind this increased consumer concern about security of supply? The line of reasoning appears to be as follows.

There has been the perception of shifting fundamentals in the global energy demand/supply balance, brought on by the unexpectedly high levels of demand growth in the developing world, especially in China and India, which became particularly apparent in 2004, after three years of relatively high market stability. Within a short time, this drew attention to a broader-based issue, in the eyes of these consumers — whether the world has enough energy resources to meet the levels of energy demand growth that have been forecast for the coming decades, affecting not just today's developed and emerging economies, but also other economies which are expected to reach take-off point in the early 21st century.

These consumer concerns have arisen at a time of heightened tensions affecting several regions of the world. On top of this, there have been some major natural disasters with which the market has had to cope at short notice. Inevitably, political opportunism has been at play too, with influential interest groups putting out alarmist theories about the world running out of oil soon or about natural disasters occurring with greater frequency in the future, and generally tying all of this in with unsubstantiated fears about unreliable sources of supply.

In speaking to you today, therefore, I should like to put your minds at ease about such matters and, more generally, about the outlook for the oil market and the role that OPEC and other producers play in it.

The commitment to security of oil supply lies at the heart of OPEC's existence. Our Organization's very first resolution, adopted at our formative meeting in Baghdad in September 1960, refers to the assurance of ""an efficient, economic and regular supply"" of petroleum to consumers. (Slide 2) This principle is enshrined in the OPEC Statute, which was adopted in 1961 and has remained a guiding light for our Organization ever since.

But this is not just altruism. The revenues oil-producing developing countries receive from petroleum sales are essential for financing their economic and social development, to an extent that may not be fully appreciated by industrialised nations. This is in addition to the part that must be reinvested in the upstream to meet rising demand. It is, therefore, in the best interests of these producing countries to ensure that every possible measure is taken to support market stability and supply security at all times.

Furthermore, for OPEC and all producing countries, there is another equally important parameter — the assurance of steady, predictable demand. This is often overlooked by consumers; but, for producers, it is as important and as basic as security of supply. Security of demand goes hand-in-hand with security of supply. OPEC's Second Solemn Declaration, which was signed by our Member Countries' Heads of State and Government in Caracas in the year 2000, emphasises ""the strong link between the security of supply and the security and transparency of world oil demand."" The Long-Term Strategy adopted by OPEC last September refers to ""the security of regular supplies to consumers, as well as the security of world oil demand.""

The OPEC Statute of 1961 also outlines other central objectives of our Organization, including ""the stabilisation of prices in international oil markets"" and ""the necessity of securing: a steady income to the producing countries; … and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry.""

To see how OPEC's longstanding commitment to security of supply works out in practice, we need only look at our Organization's actions in the volatile international oil market of the past two years. In doing so, we can see that, throughout this period, the market has remained well-supplied with oil and that other factors have been driving-up oil prices, such as downstream bottlenecks, geopolitical tensions and increased speculation in futures markets.

(Slide 3) First, OPEC's Member Countries have increased production by around 4.5 million barrels a day since 2002. This has, in turn, led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks, which are now exceeding their five-year average.

(Slide 4) Secondly, where possible, our Member Countries have accelerated their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and to re-establish a comfortable level of spare capacity. This spare capacity — which is now at 2.0 mb/d — will be more than adequate to cover oil demand growth throughout 2006, when the call on OPEC oil is expected to be slightly lower than in 2005. (Slide 5) More increases in capacity have been planned — and are being implemented — for the rest of the decade. Together with the expected growth in non-OPEC supply and OPEC natural gas liquids, this means that cumulative world oil production capacity will rise by around 12 mb/d or more over the next five years — well above the expected cumulative rise in demand of 7–8 mb/d over the same period.

And thirdly, at a time when severe downstream bottlenecks in some major consuming countries have been putting pressure on not just product prices, but also crude prices, especially light, sweet blends, OPEC's Member Countries, although traditionally associated more with the upstream, have themselves taken the initiative to invest in downstream projects; this has been on their own and in partnership with others. Currently, 0.6 mb/d of refinery capacity is under construction, with an additional 1.9 mb/d planned and a further 1.4 mb/d under consideration, to make a total of 3.8 mb/d by 2010. However, all of this does not escape the fact that downstream investment is primarily the responsibility of the domestic and international oil companies in consuming countries.

Clearly, such actions as these come from an Organization that is committed to security of supply. This involves careful analysis of the market outlook, detailed planning and considerable upfront investment, perhaps diverting funds from other worthy domestic causes, in order to make absolutely sure that there is enough oil on the market. I will return to investment later.

The year 2006 has begun with a significant rise in prices, even though the market remains well-supplied with crude and commercial oil stock levels in the OECD are healthy. This, once again, is primarily the result of refining bottlenecks and other non-fundamental factors. However, the continued price volatility is, as ever, a matter of much concern to us, in particular the impact it may be having on the global economy and, especially, developing countries. The OPEC Secretariat in Vienna continues to monitor the situation carefully.

(Slide 6) Nevertheless, looking further into 2006 and at the forecast supply/demand balance, we believe in general that the market supply will remain ahead of demand and that spare capacity will even increase.

Generally speaking, OPEC desires prices that reflect market fundamentals and that are acceptable for producers and consumers alike. Only in this way can our Organization provide the stability and the sustainability that is so important to the steady growth in supply that is needed to support the rising levels of demand that have been forecast for the opening decades of this century. I shall return to the subject of market forecasts in a minute.

Price stability is, indeed, a realistic prospect, but it is something that must be worked on by all the players in the market, and not just by certain committed groups, if it is to be sustainable over long periods. Stability is the responsibility of all parties. High levels of volatility can be very damaging to the market; they can destabilise other sectors of the global economy; they can be prey to rampant speculation, which, in itself, can then add to the volatility; and they can severely hinder investment strategies in future production capacity.

(Slide 7) And finally, on the subject of prices, let me put them in their proper historical context by pointing out that, although oil prices are high in nominal terms, they are nevertheless below those of the early 1980s in real terms. The relative resilience of the global economy to the recent price increases is in part because considerably less oil is now used to produce each dollar of national income, when compared to the past. For example, OECD oil intensities have fallen by almost 60% since 1970. Even developing countries are using less oil per unit of GDP. In addition, what has gone hand in hand with this decline in intensities, of course, has been the falling share of energy in the consumers' budget, as their wealth has increased. We should also remember that the recent rise in oil prices was accompanied by a strong increase in non-energy commodity prices (Slide 8). For example, since the beginning of 2002, steel, copper, iron, lead, nickel and zinc prices have all roughly doubled, while rubber and uranium prices have tripled. These price rises are generally viewed as being driven by the strong synchronised economic expansion over this period.

Let us now look at the long-term prospects for the oil market, since OPEC's commitment to market stability and security is as valid for the long term as it is for the short term. (Slide 9) Demand for energy will continue to grow, as a result of demographics, (with an expected 1.6 billion additional people on the planet within the next 25 years), increases in incomes, continued urbanisation and globalisation. Firstly, we should note that, not only has oil been in the leading position in supplying the world's growing energy needs for the past four decades, but also that there is a clear expectation that this will continue at least for the next two decades. Gas will continue also to grow at fast rates, becoming by 2025 the second most important fuel, ahead of coal. Hydro/nuclear/new renewables will flatten out, despite the extreme high growth rates for some new renewables; however, the rather low initial base makes the growth in absolute terms rather limited.

(Slide 10) According to the reference case scenario from OPEC's World Energy Model, ""OWEM"", world oil demand is expected to continue rising in the early decades of the 21st century, with annual growth averaging 1.5 per cent up to 2025, when demand will reach 113 mb/d. A startling 80 per cent of the increase in global oil demand will come from developing countries. However, despite this growth, oil use per capita will remain far below the levels seen in the OECD. The transportation sector is particularly important for this growth, with the huge potential for increases in vehicle ownership in developing countries. Asian countries, home to half the world's population, are forecast to experience annual economic growth of over 5 per cent over the next two decades, and, coupled with this large potential for growth, will remain the key source of oil demand increases in the developing world.

Over the coming years, non-OPEC output is expected to continue to grow and reach a plateau of 55–57 mb/d after 2010. (Slide 11) This will mean that the call on OPEC oil will increase substantially, with the Organization's output, including natural gas liquids, rising to 57 mb/d in 2025, compared with 33 mb/d in 2005.

Let me emphasise here that, although we are envisaging higher levels of demand in the future, the global resource availability is not a constraint to meeting this in full. Proven reserves continue to grow on account of new discoveries, as well as reserve growth resulting from advances in technology and improved recovery techniques. This is not to mention the huge potential from unconventional oil resources, such as tar sands. In fact, estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves have been increasing over time. OPEC possesses nearly four-fifths of the world's proven crude oil reserves, and these are sufficient to meet the growing oil requirement for decades to come.

The scale of investment required to meet the expected demand growth over the next few decades runs into billions of dollars, although globally it will not be significantly different to past investment. This is due to the gradual shift away from higher cost non-OPEC supply to lower cost OPEC oil. Of course, oil prices will need to be at a level conducive to supporting the investment required. But there are many uncertainties which make sound investment planning a hazardous business. Future economic growth rates, consumer government energy and environmental policies, technological advances and the oil price path lie at the heart of these uncertainties (Slide 12). Given the role that OPEC plays in supporting market stability by supplying the residual barrel, this uncertainty naturally translates into a wide range of possible levels of future oil supply that will be required from OPEC. With a high growth and low growth case, a range of well over 10 mb/d opens up for the possible amount of oil that OPEC might have to supply by 2020. Over-investment implies heavy costs to be borne by producers, while under-investment will lead to severe price movements (Slide 13). Thus every effort must be made to reduce uncertainties and share the risks among the various parties in the oil industry — OPEC and non-OPEC, producers and consumers, and the international oil companies and other intermediaries.

Importantly, as the President of the OPEC Conference, Dr Edmund Maduabebe Daukoru, said a fortnight ago: ""We all have to work together towards global energy security."" He advised against consuming countries taking a unilateral approach to handling global energy issues.

(Slide 14) The need for enhanced energy security has to be seen from both supply and demand perspectives, which are mutually supportive. Uncertainty over future demand translates into large uncertainties over the amount of oil that OPEC member countries will eventually need to supply, signifying a heavy burden of risk. Investment requirements are very large, and are subject to considerably long lead-times. It is in this context that there is a call for a ""road-map"" for oil demand, reflecting the need for security of demand as a legitimate concern for producers, just as consumers express concern over security of supply. With more transparency in the evolution and implementation of policies, better assessments will be possible as to how future demand is likely to evolve. This, in turn, would lend support to making appropriate capacity expansion decisions that would meet both the increased demand for OPEC oil but also offer an adequate level of spare capacity, while at the same time not wasting precious financial resources.

I would like to turn attention to the downstream sector. (Slide 15). This is a very important part of the supply chain, with the current tightness in the form of inadequate refining capacity putting pressure on oil prices. Several factors will shape developments in this sector in the coming decade. The first concerns the rising volume of crude oil that needs to be refined. Another element is how the oil product demand structure will change, with the expectation that there will be a continued move towards lighter products. At the same time, product specifications are moving towards significantly cleaner products that will require substantial reductions in sulphur content, driven by environmental concerns. Therefore, the downstream sector will require significant investment to meet growing product demand and to address emerging mismatches between crude slate, product demand and product specifications.

Considering recent relatively high refinery utilisation rates, distillation capacity expansion might be expected to at least keep pace with growing demand. However, a review of known refining expansion projects does not support this. From the current perspective, investments to the refining sector are coming at a considerably slower pace then is warranted by expected growth in demand: a more orchestrated effort is clearly required to ensure sufficient capacities are in place in the future.

To meet the future challenges about $160 billion in capacity investment will be required by 2015 and another $150 billion needed for capacity maintenance and replacement of lost capacity. The emerging investment trends suggest that the downstream sector could very well remain a source of market instability over the coming years. It is therefore a pressing area for discussion among all parties, and ways need to be explored that could accelerate expansion plans.

(Slide 16) OPEC has devoted so much effort towards encouraging dialogue and cooperation in the industry over the past two decades. As you may know, the most recent result of this was the establishment, last year, of energy dialogues between OPEC and, respectively, the European Union, China and Russia. In two months' time, producers and consumers will meet at Ministerial level at the tenth International Energy Forum in Doha, in order to discuss at length the latest developments affecting the industry. We are firmly convinced that such dialogue is the way forward for the industry, if it is going to evolve in an orderly manner in the opening decades of this century and successfully meet the challenges that lie before it, including the continued assurance of security of supply and demand.

"2006-01-26","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for inviting me to contribute to this Working Lunch/Ministerial Address at the Davos Energy Summit.

The title of the summit - “Managing Tectonic Shifts” - has, as its principal focus, the major developments that have been manifesting themselves in the energy industry over the past few years. These have been particularly apparent in the oil sector, the obvious leading sector in the energy industry and the one which relates directly to OPEC and its contribution to the global economy.

How do we see the new energy challenges, insofar as they relate to the oil sector?

Let us look at the events of the past two years in the oil market.

There has been the challenge of meeting exceptionally high levels of growth in oil demand from large emerging economies, especially China and India, as well as from some developed economies, such as the USA. High oil demand by itself is good news: it is a reflection of a healthy world economy, better social progress in many parts of the world, and, maybe, some success in poverty eradication, as this inevitably translates into higher energy intensity.

The challenge, however, is not only in the upstream, but also in the downstream. The upstream has been remarkably responsive, even in times of large weather-related supply disruptions, as we witnessed last year in the USA. On the contrary, it is now widely accepted that the price volatility of the past two years has been driven much more by downstream bottlenecks in consuming countries than by shortages upstream.

For the past three years, the market has been well-supplied with crude — thanks to OPEC’s timely actions. Yes, it is true that, in 2004, spare capacity reached its lowest level since the 1970s; but, with this behind us now, we can expect a comfortable cushion upstream to cope with rising demand for the foreseeable future — from both OPEC and non-OPEC producers. The positive role of spare capacity that OPEC offers to the benefit of the world at large will, I am sure, become more widely recognised with the passage of time.

Recent events have highlighted once again another challenge, and this is the need to reduce the impact of speculative activity on volatility and price levels. Unrestrained speculation can greatly exaggerate the impact of external events on the market, to the detriment of producers and consumers alike and with damaging repercussions further afield in the global economy.

However, if there is one outstanding challenge that has emerged — or, more accurately, re-emerged — it is the need to prevent rapid upheavals from occurring in the market in the future. The century began with three years of high market stability, which was to the satisfaction of all responsible parties, But, since then, we have been experiencing a very different and much more volatile situation.

This is by no means a new phenomenon. We have seen time and again throughout the 150-year history of the modern petroleum industry big swings in the market’s fortunes in the space of months, and sometimes even weeks, and this has been very damaging to the industry. Is there really a means of preventing this in the future? In posing this question, I am looking beyond partisan views. Phenomena such as these can become endemic to the industry, if left without an effective, central guiding influence.

I have isolated these challenges, because they have come to the fore in the volatile conditions of the past two years, and can, in that sense, be described as “new”. However, we have a broader vision of the challenges and some of these date from the foundation of OPEC 45 years ago, while others are closer in time. We recently reviewed these challenges and prepared a long-term strategy for our Organization, which was adopted last September, to provide a coherent, consistent vision and framework for the future.

The strategy is comprehensive in scope and covers a wide range of objectives, such as: achieving and maintaining fair, stable prices; meeting future demand; ensuring security of supply; and promoting the legitimate interests of Member Countries in multilateral agreements.

The strategy also identifies the key challenges that may constitute constraints for OPEC in the attainment of its constructive global objectives. These include uncertainties surrounding future oil demand, stemming from, inter alia, the prospects for the world economy, consuming countries’ energy and environmental policies, and technological developments. They also concern the supply side, taking into account the resource limitations, potential non-OPEC production, and the extent and timing of required investment, together with the associated uncertainties.

Dialogue among producers and between producers and consumers constitutes a crucial element of the strategy. It recommends that such dialogue should be widened and deepened to cover more issues of mutual concern, such as demand predictability. security of supply, market stability, investment, technology and the downstream.

The strategy covers many other areas that relate to the sound development of the oil industry in the future, upstream and downstream, utilising the latest technology to produce fuels that are cleaner, more efficient and environmentally friendly.

The point I am trying to make in all of this is that OPEC has been around a long time and has a long institutional memory in oil matters. We know that it is in the best interest of our Member Countries to ensure that the market operates smoothly and effectively at all times, in balance with the interests of the other stakeholders in the industry. We have demonstrated our commitment to market stability repeatedly over all time horizons, and have shown that we have had the vision, the responsiveness and the flexibility to cope with new situations as they arise. But we cannot work miracles, as we have seen recently, when factors beyond our influence or control have been primarily responsible for the price volatility in a market well-supplied with crude. Market order requires the support of all parties.

Thus, while OPEC has its own strategy in facing energy challenges, old and new, this will only be truly effective if it is accompanied by a spirit of cooperation between oil producers and consumers.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/314-26-january-2006.html"
"2005-12-26","Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

It is both an honour and a pleasure to have this opportunity to meet, once again, Your Excellency, to discuss the possibility of taking a major step forward in the dialogue between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the Russian Federation as the largest oil producers and exporters.

Dialogue is no stranger to the relationship between OPEC and Russia.

Over the past decade and a half, OPEC has welcomed the support to its market-stabilisation measures from Russia. Due to the fact that Russia is the world’s second-largest crude oil producer and exporter and that it is the number-one gas producer and exporter, this has greatly enhanced the effectiveness of these measures.

Your commitment has also been demonstrated by the attendance of representatives from your country at many OPEC Ministerial Conferences as observers, sending a strong signal to the world at large about the importance Russia attaches to dialogue and cooperation, particularly involving our Organization.

Furthermore, Russian officials have also made valuable contributions to OPEC seminars and other such gatherings, and, in so doing, added significantly to the international standing of these events.

For our part, we have welcomed the opportunity to participate in Russia’s annual Oil and Gas Weeks, especially since this event has now established itself as a major addition to the international energy calendar, attracting top-level participants from every branch of the oil and gas industry.

As we all know, bilateral contacts already exist between OPEC and Russia, both individually — with our Member Countries — and collectively.

The expressed desire by both OPEC and Russia to establish dialogue on a more formal basis is an almost inevitable consequence of the steady evolution of the OPEC-Russia relationship over the past decade and a half. This began effectively with Russia becoming a major player in the oil market on the world stage, rather than the regional one.

We have seen how effective such a formal dialogue could be through — among other things — the success of the two joint workshops organised by OPEC and the International Institute of Energy Policy and Diplomacy of MGIMO University of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. These provided participants with the chance to take an in-depth look at market issues which were of much topical interest to the relationships between OPEC and its Member Countries and Russia. We very much look forward to hosting the third workshop in Vienna next year.

Given the challenges facing the global energy scene today and our mutual interest in creating a more stable and effective international oil market now and in the future, we seek to take our dialogue a step forward. An enhanced dialogue among producers, in particular between Russia and OPEC will benefit globally both producers and consumers, contribute immensely to market stability and improve energy security. It will assure consumers, especially those in developing countries with rising demand, of assured and reliable oil and gas supplies to fuel their economic development in the twenty first century.

In line with OPEC’s two other achievements in energy dialogue this year, we propose to establish a balanced, pragmatic framework for cooperation, and to develop an ongoing exchange of views at all levels on energy issues of common interest, in particular security of supply and demand. At today’s meeting, we will have the chance to discuss the objectives, scope, modalities, frequency and overall structure of the dialogue, as well as define its themes and areas of mutual interest.

Finally, our meeting today before Russia takes over the Chair of the Group of Eight countries next week is of particular significance. This is because, as a country whose recent history is very different to that of the other G-8 members, as well as one which is such a large producer, exporter and consumer of energy, Russia is in a position to share perspectives on oil issues which have not previously come to the fore within that body. This could ultimately prove to be to the benefit of the energy community at large, consumers as well as producers in both developed and developing countries.

Naturally enough, OPEC Secretariat has recently provided authorities in the Russian Federation, upon their request, with its perspective on major issues and challenges facing the oil industry which we hope you will find useful in the preparation and deliberations on the energy theme currently underway for the G8 Summit. Recognizing the importance of exchanging views on critical oil matters, OPEC is ready to provide any additional constructive input needed to support this process, especially from the point of view of oil-producing countries.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/326-26-december-2005.html"
"2005-12-02","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for permitting me to deliver a few words in my capacity as Alternate President of the OPEC Conference. Expectedly, I shall have the honour of taking on the mantle of OPEC President on 1 January 2006, a challenging assignment which will require my total commitment.

I shall be taking over from a very capable colleague and President, His Excellency Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, the Minister of Energy for Kuwait, whose wise counsel we have just heard and whose vision and drive have done so much to get the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue off the ground this year.

This being the last Dialogue at which His Excellency will be leading the OPEC delegation, I want to thank him most sincerely for his rich and excellent contributions, and to hope that he will continue to be a champion of the process even after his term of office as OPEC President expires at the end of the year.

It has been a great privilege for me to have been a part of the Dialogue process from inception and thus to share at first hand the over-riding motivation, as well as the particular interests behind the written record of its proceedings.

As the two groups of nations, essentially consumers and producers, engage in this process, it is important that we adopt a pragmatic attitude of give-and-take towards these interests, beyond the shared motivation of market stabilization. I am convinced that this is the only way to ensure that the Dialogue succeeds and endures for the benefit of the participants and the global economy in general.

The EU is already OPEC’s main trading partner and the flow of goods and services — oil and non-oil — among the Members of the two groups continues to grow. We want to do everything we can to encourage this and the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue provides a wonderful broad avenue of opportunity in this respect.

My final comment in this brief opening statement concerns the OPEC Secretariat's host nation. As many of you know, nearly three months ago OPEC celebrated the 40th anniversary of setting up its Secretariat in Vienna, at the invitation of the Federal Republic of Austria. And, as we made clear during the celebrations, the Federal Republic and the City of Vienna have looked after us very well!

We should like to wish the Federal Republic of Austria every success as it takes over the six-month rotational Presidency of the EU on 1 January 2006. We believe that, at the same time, this can only serve for the good of the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue, due to the longstanding, close relationship that exists between Austria and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/327-2-december-2005.html"
"2005-12-02","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the OPEC Secretariat in this beautiful and historic city for the Second Ministerial Meeting of the EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue. I am particularly pleased to welcome our EU counterparts, Their Excellencies Mr Malcolm Wicks, UK Minister of Energy, Dr Martin Bartenstein, Austrian Ministry of Economy and Labour, and Mr Andris Piebalgs, European Commissioner for Energy.

As you know, today’s meeting comes six months after the inaugural event in Brussels on 9 June. That meeting provided us with the opportunity to set priorities on issues of greatest mutual concern to our two Organizations. We also had the opportunity to learn more about each other and the way we operate. This is very important when establishing a long-term relationship. Since then, much work has been carried out behind the scenes in both Brussels and Vienna, with the intention of moving the dialogue forward in a timely and effective manner, in accordance with the decisions reached six months ago. The purpose has been to cultivate a dialogue that addresses practical issues in an objective and cooperative manner and, at the same time, is forward-looking in its scope, realistic in its approach and effective in its execution.

The most visible evidence of the hard work undertaken was the holding of the dialogue’s first joint Roundtable in Vienna at the beginning of last week, when the assembled experts from both the EU and OPEC, as well as external financial specialists, examined oil market developments in greater depth. They identified two areas of interest, namely the refining sector and financial markets, both of which were seen to influence the volatility that has gripped the market recently. The report on the Roundtable will be reviewed at today’s meeting.

Other important advances in producer-consumer dialogue have been taking place elsewhere during this period. Of particular relevance to today’s meeting was the formal inauguration of the International Energy Forum’s Secretariat in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, less than two weeks ago. At the same event, the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI) database was also launched, and both the OPEC Secretariat and Eurostat, the statistical arm of the EU, together with four other international organisations, have been behind the development of this facility, which provides data on oil, gas and refined product output, stocks and demand from more than 90 countries.

Excellencies, since our last meeting in June, the oil market has undergone major developments. Increased demand coupled with significant supply disruptions resulting from Hurricane Katrina pushed oil prices to levels that gave all of us deep concern.

However, thanks to the spirit of cooperation and dialogue, wherein OPEC immediately increased its production to offset any physical shortage of crude, and the emergency response measures from the IEA, prices began to moderate. In addition OPEC put 2mbd of its available spare capacity to the market. Crude prices have moderated significantly since early September as a result of these actions, and are moving towards market fundamentals. The products market is still under pressure from existing bottlenecks in the downstream sector. This problem needs to be tackled seriously, for if the downstream is not able to produce the products that the market wants, then there is pressure on the light sweet crudes, which drives up the price of other crudes to a certain degree.

Although OPEC believes that solving the problem in the downstream sector is the responsibility of consumer countries, many of our Member Countries have taken it upon themselves to build additional refineries, both domestically and abroad, with a view to helping solve this problem in the overall interest of the industry. However, we will continue to urge consumer countries to invest in the downstream sector so as to remove the pressure on product prices.

In addition, we believe that it will be in the best interest of the final consumer, and indeed of the industry as a whole, if consumer governments review and rationalize their fuel taxation policies, especially when prices rise to levels that are considered very high. There is also a need to reduce uncertainties of future demand so that timely in both the upstream and downstream sectors can be made.

Excellencies, two months ago, the OPEC’s Ministerial Conference restated its commitment to producer-consumer dialogue with the adoption of a Comprehensive Long-Term Strategy. Noting that the process of dialogue constituted a crucial element of this strategy, it was recommended that it should be broadened to cover more issues of mutual concern, such as security of demand and supply, market stability, investment, technology and the downstream sector.

Cooperation and dialogue do not happen by chance. They are the result of inspiration, vision, concern, open-mindedness, flexibility, dedication, hard work and other attributes that, combined, seek to improve the welfare of mankind generally and, in this particular case, the efficiency and effectiveness of the energy sector – notably the oil market. Thanks is therefore due to all those who have contributed to this process over the past 12 months since preparations begun to start this dialogue.

However, we are only at the beginning of the road, and it is a very long road. Perhaps it is a road with no ending, because our dialogue has been set up on a permanent basis. A good part of the discussions in the dialogue – both now and in the future – will concern issues that evolve as the industry evolves and, therefore, have a strong underlying continuity about them, requiring frequent reappraisal as market conditions change. What we have begun now is a big challenge and I believe we are up to it.

I should like to conclude my opening remarks by reaffirming OPEC’s continuous commitment to engage in fruitful dialogue with consuming nations in order to acquire greater understanding of the challenges facing the different parties involved and determine means of meeting such challenges in a constructive and harmonious manner. We believe that through such dialogue, measures can be adopted that will lead to an open, transparent and stable market, beneficial to all participants, producers and consumers alike.

Clearly this process is now already well under way. It is being driven by the commitment, enthusiasm and hard work of both the European Union and OPEC. This will, without any doubt, serve the best interests of both groups, as well as those of the oil market itself and the global economy at large.

On a final note, I should like to extend our sincere gratitude to our host country the Federal Republic of Austria, an important member of the EU, for their great hospitality since we moved our headquarters to this beautiful city 40 years ago. I am confident that, under the EU Presidency of Austria, we will further strengthen the very good relationship between OPEC and the EU.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/328-2-december-2005.html"
"2005-11-02","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking Minister Khristenko and the organisers for inviting me to address the 5th Russian Oil and Gas Week here in Moscow. This annual event has established itself as a major addition to the international energy calendar and attracts top-level participants from every branch of the oil and gas industry, with expertise of the highest calibre.

This is especially the case, because of the key position Russia holds in the world energy sector, particularly for oil and gas. As the world’s second-largest crude oil producer and exporter with the largest proven natural gas reserves, it is also the largest gas producer and exporter. Russia has a big influence on energy developments well beyond its vast borders.

Indeed, this influence is likely to grow in particular next year, as Russia takes over the Chair of the Group of Eight countries. As a country whose recent history — in the 20th century — is very different to that of the other members, as well as one which is such a large producer, exporter and consumer of energy, Russia may be in a position to share perspectives which have not previously come to the fore within that august body. This is reinforced by the fact that Russia is described as being one of the “Brics” countries and, together with Brazil, India and China, is seen as a major new player on the international economic and political landscape.

Over the past decade and a half, OPEC has welcomed the constructive steps Russia has taken in the process of dialogue among oil producers and between producers and consumers, the support it has given to our market-stabilisation measures, and the perspective awareness as major energy exporter it has shown on some of the market realities which may not be so apparent to long-established consumer nations. In an energy world where dialogue and cooperation are already at a more advanced stage than ever before, we believe that Russia, as Chair of the G8, may be in a position to take this process even further, to the benefit of the energy community at large, consumers as well as producers in both developed and developing countries.

It would be a good time to do so, in view of the difficulties experienced in the international oil market over the past two years and the many misunderstandings and anxieties that have accompanied this. Notwithstanding this, OPEC is confident about the ability of the market to bring oil to consumers as a when needed, both now and in the future, and it is committed to doing everything it can to bring this about in a timely, effective and sustainable manner. In doing so, OPEC welcomes Russia’s contribution in what is, after all, a complex, fast-moving and often-over-reactive international market environment. A healthy oil market is central to the pursuit of sound world economic growth, where the benefits should be shared among mankind as a whole, and not just fortunate — and privileged — sections of it.

Looking at the current market situation, we see that a confluence of factors has been at work over the past couple of years, leading to the persistent price rises and volatility. We have also observed a shift in the focus from the upstream to the downstream.

[Slide 2 - 4] The spotlight was initially on the upstream, with the unexpectedly high oil demand growth in 2003 and its acceleration to exceptional levels in 2004. This was connected, in particular, to the high level of economic growth of China and the USA. [Slide 5] It was exacerbated by a notable development on the supply side, when the growth in non-OPEC supply started to fall behind that of world oil demand, reversing earlier trends of matching or exceeding demand growth. However, during the course of last year, it became steadily apparent that the destabilising forces lay more — and increasingly — in the downstream than in the upstream, and this trend has continued to the present day.

[Slide 6] Indeed, this year, while demand growth has remained at healthy, though more modest and sustainable levels, the challenge of providing adequate crude supply is being met successfully. This has been largely due to OPEC’s actions, raising its production by more than 4.5 mb/d since 2003, as part of its market-stabilisation measures. This has, in turn, led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks, which are now exceeding their five-year average.

[Slide 7] OPEC has also been acting on a second front. Assuming that the high levels of oil demand growth — of about 1.5 mb/d per year — are likely to remain at least in the medium term, our Member Countries have sought to accelerate their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity to meet continued demand growth and to re-establish a comfortable level of capacity and help calm markets during the present troubled period. This spare capacity — which is now at 2.0 mb/d — will be more than adequate to cover oil demand growth throughout this winter and in 2006, with the call on OPEC being around the 2005 level. More increases in capacity have been planned — and are being implemented — for the rest of the decade.

Also, next year is expected to see non-OPEC oil supply growth recover to 1.6 mb/d from the exceptionally low level of 0.7 mb/d witnessed this year — this figure includes non-OPEC natural gas liquids and non-conventional oils. [Slide 8] On balance, we expect annual average growth of around 1 mb/d in non-OPEC supply up to 2010, slowing thereafter. Combined with the planned increase in OPEC capacity from 32.5 mb/d to more than 38 mb/d by 2010 and an additional 1.5 mb/d increase in OPEC natural gas liquids over the same period, this means that cumulative world oil production capacity will rise by around 12 mb/d or more, over the next five years. This will be well above the expected cumulative rise in demand of 7–8 mb/d over the same period , and thus it will more than cover the forecast growth in demand.

Also, the fact that the market has, over the past two years, experienced and successfully handled a serious spare capacity limitation, together with the fact that the greater revenues generated by the recent higher oil prices have allowed more funds for reinvestment in the industry — compared with the under-investment in new capacity that occurred previously when prices were much lower — is a very positive sign for the assurance of crude oil sufficiency well beyond the opening decade of this century.

[Slide 9] There is a different picture downstream, however.

The continued serious downstream bottlenecks in some major consuming countries — due mainly to a lack of timely investment and to increasingly stringent product specifications motivated by environmental concerns — have seen refineries operating at near capacity to keep pace with rising demand. Not only is this putting pressure on product prices, but its effects are also felt subsequently on crude prices, especially light, sweet blends — as was demonstrated vividly last month following the disruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to the US Gulf Coast. Clearly, the industry at large must pay more attention to the downstream part of the supply-chain, in the interests of overall market stability. [Slide 10] In particular, concrete measures should be taken on the part of the governments in consuming countries, to create an enabling environment to encourage rapid, sizeable investments in the refining sector, especially in conversion capacity, which has persistently lagged behind market requirements. Without adequate and timely measures from that side of the industry, today’s high and volatile oil prices are likely to remain a feature of the market.

OPEC’s Member Countries, although traditionally associated more with the upstream, have themselves taken the initiative — on their own and in partnership with others — to invest in downstream projects. However, downstream investment is primarily the responsibility of the domestic and international oil companies in consuming countries. [Slide 11] In this context, it should be noted that the recent large revenue increases of the international oil companies have not yet been visibly translated into substantial additional investment, and this includes the upstream, as well as the downstream. There are reports of refiners’ returns more than tripling over the past 12 months, compared with 45 per cent gains for crude producers. [Slide 12] Nevertheless, looking at the overall picture, as it stands now, it does not appear that the growth in refinery capacity will match demand growth before 2007.

[Slide 13] On top of all this, there has been widespread concern about possible future supply disruptions that may result from increased geopolitical tensions or other causes. These factors — taken together — have been reflected in increased speculation in futures markets, particularly through a rise in activity by non-commercials, notably pension and trust funds, which has, in turn, resulted in a rise in open commitments; both have correlated strongly with the price increases of the last two years. Without any doubt, due largely to the perceived capacity constraints, the market has become very nervous and over-responsive to external impulses.

Let me at this point make a few additional observations about the present higher prices.

The global economy has so far shown remarkable resilience to the price rises — a fact acknowledged by such financial institutions as the International Monetary Fund. However, we must not be complacent, as signs of an impact on some economies are beginning to appear, especially on emerging economies with large fuel subsidies.

And, while this is a matter of much concern to us, we must nonetheless point out that the situation is very different to what it was several decades ago. [Slide 14] First, in real terms, crude oil prices, although high, are still well below levels reached in the early 1980s. [Slide 15] And secondly, the world is decreasingly dependant on oil for its economic growth. Globally, oil intensity — the amount of oil required for a pre-defined unit of GDP — has fallen by around 50 per cent since 1970, due to such factors as technology, improved efficiency, government policies and changing consumer behaviour.

Furthermore, it must be stressed once again that OPEC does not welcome prices that remain out of line with market fundamentals as we have seen in recent months. These will contain within themselves the seeds of further volatility, and this will be detrimental to the steady flow of petroleum revenue that is essential for investment in domestic socio-economic development, as well as reinvestment in the industry. This is why OPEC goes to great lengths to promote order and stability in the oil market, with secure supply, steady, predictable demand, reasonable prices and fair returns for investors.

OPEC’s commitment to stability applies equally to the long term. This was underlined once again in Vienna last month, when OPEC’s Ministerial Conference adopted a comprehensive long-term strategy, to provide a coherent and consistent vision and framework to guide our future actions.

The strategy explicitly recognises the important role of oil in the world economy at large in the future, recalls and delineates further the objectives of the Organization, identifies the key challenges it faces now and in the future, and explores scenarios for the energy scene. In doing so, it covers such important elements as the oil price, upstream and downstream investment, technology, the role of OPEC national oil companies, multilateral agreements and negotiations related to energy, and the relationships with both producers and consumers, as well as with international organisations and institutions.

Regarding oil prices, the strategy builds upon the fundamental recognition that extreme price levels, either too high or too low, are damaging for both producers and consumers, and it points to the need to be proactive under all market conditions. It also re-emphasises OPEC’s commitment to support market stability and, in achieving this, stresses the role of other producers, as well as, especially with regard to the downstream sector, consuming countries. Hence, the dialogue among producers, and between producers and consumers, constitutes a crucial element of the strategy, which recommends that such dialogue should be widened and deepened to cover more issues of mutual concern, such as security of demand and supply, market stability, investment, technology and the downstream. OPEC’s adoption of such a comprehensive long-term strategy should be highly reassuring for the market at large.

[Slide 16] According to our own forecasts at a global level — based on the reference case scenario from the OPEC World Energy Model — world oil demand is expected to continue to rise in the early decades of the 21st century, with annual growth averaging 1.5 per cent up to 2025, when demand will reach 113 mb/d. [Slide 17] During this period, non-OPEC output is expected to continue to grow and reach a plateau of 55–57 mb/d after 2010. This will mean that the call on OPEC oil will increase substantially, with the Organization’s output, including natural gas liquids, rising by more than 70 per cent to 57 mb/d in 2025, compared with 33 mb/d in 2005. By then, according to this scenario, OPEC’s market share will have penetrated the 50 per cent barrier, from around 40 per cent now.

[Slide 18] Even though the numbers involved are very large, the global resource availability is not a constraint. OPEC itself has the reserves to meet the growing oil requirement, to ensure that the market remains well-supplied with crude at all times, at reasonable prices that are compatible with robust growth in the world economy. However, for geological reasons, OPEC will increasingly be accessing reserves that are on the heavier side, and therefore future refineries will have to be designed and equipped to process these into the more highly demanded lighter products. The Organization is committed to maintaining and developing sound investment strategies, to provide the required production capacity for oil that is cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before. In pursuing such strategies, Member Countries will choose the models of collaboration with the international oil industry that best suit their particular environments.

But there are many uncertainties which make sound investment planning a hazardous business. Future economic growth rates, consumer government energy and environmental policies, technological advances and the oil price path lie at the heart of these uncertainties. Over-investment implies heavy costs to be borne by producers, while under-investment will lead to severe price movements. Contrasting scenarios, explored by OPEC to identify the impact of such uncertainties, show differences as large as 10 or 11 mb/d in world oil demand within a decade and a half. The implications of such uncertainties for investment requirements are obvious and could translate in over $150 trillion. Thus every effort must be made to reduce uncertainties and share the risks involved.

All of this is more than just a question of quantity, however. Crucially, it also involves quality. It is necessary for producers everywhere to bring the right type of oil to the market, as and when required. This includes, for example, the production and use of cleaner petroleum-based fuels and the development of technologies that address climate change concerns, such as carbon dioxide sequestration in depleting oil and gas fields for which, when combined with enhanced oil recovery, could truly lead to a “win-win” situation.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I began this address by referring to the important — and growing — role Russia plays in the international arena. In the context of this Oil and Gas Week, I noted three points of significance: Russia being a major energy producer and consumer; Russia being a “Brics” country; and, specifically for the near future, Russia holding the Chair of the G8 in 2006. On top of this, through its actions, the Government has been giving a clear message that it considers its oil and gas sector to be a key part of the country’s economic development in the years ahead and that the sector’s continuing evolution must be in harmony with this.

OPEC is encouraged by this and looks forward to opportunities to expand cooperation and dialogue, so as to help Russia achieve its energy goals in a stable and progressive environment in the years ahead.

Let me conclude by emphasizing that in the 21st century the benefit from oil as most influential fuel for development and economic growth should and could extend to all countries in particular developing countries most of whom missed out in the past.

[Slide 19] Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/329-2-nov-2005.html"
"2005-11-02","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to address this distinguished audience.

Responsible parties in the oil industry are as concerned about the long-term fundamentals as they are about current market developments. This is clearly true for the Pio Manzù Centre, just as it is true for OPEC. Indeed, it was only last month that OPEC's Ministerial Conference adopted a comprehensive long-term strategy, to provide a coherent, consistent vision and guiding framework for the Organization's future.

OPEC broadly agrees with the three decisive challenges defined by the organisers in their forward to this conference, relating to growing energy demand, the economic development of poorer nations and environmental harmony. These tie in closely with OPEC's own longstanding aims and objectives, which were reaffirmed last month with the adoption of the long-term strategy.

OPEC is fully committed to market stability at all times, with secure supply, reasonable prices that are equally rewarding to producers, investors and consumers, and consistent with robust economic growth, especially for developing economies. This commitment underlies OPEC's market-stabilisation measures, which are built around maintaining adequate spare capacity and ensuring that this is used to help balance the market and keep it well supplied.

These measures have met with much success over the years, enabling OPEC to handle challenges in a timely and effective manner, such as during the supply disruptions in 1990 and 2003, as well as the recent unexpected demand surge.

But the market developments over the past two years have been more complex, with the initial price rise attributable to the high oil demand growth that started in 2003 and accelerated in 2004, to such an extent that slowing growth in non-OPEC crude oil supply could not keep pace with it. However, the market has been well-supplied with crude throughout most of this volatile period. Indeed, this has been very much due to OPEC's timely efforts to increase both actual oil production - by more than 4.5 million barrels a day since 2003 - and production capacity - so as to rebuild a sufficient level of spare capacity, which now exceeds 2 mb/d. Further increases in OPEC capacity already underway, of over 5 mb/d to more than 38 mb/d by 2010, mean that this healthy state will continue throughout this decade.

However, refinery capacity bottlenecks in major industrialised countries were soon found to be increasingly the generators of pressure on fuel supply to end-consumers, and hence on prices (and for products, in particular), since this was taking place in an often-nervous market with an unusually high level of speculation in futures. This will continue to be the case for a few years, until sufficient new refining capacity is built.

Two further aspects of the foreword are also to be welcomed: the need for ongoing, effective dialogue and the determination of broad policy directions now, rather than in the future. This very much echoes OPEC's longstanding calls over the years for enhanced dialogue and cooperation.

OPEC has, indeed, played a prominent role in advancing dialogue. This includes the establishment of a biennial ministerial producer-consumer dialogue, the International Energy Forum, whose Secretariat has been set up recently in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia, and the strengthening of dialogue between OPEC and the International Energy Agency. This year witnessed the launch of a formal energy dialogue between OPEC and the European Union, to regularly examine the energy challenges facing the two groups and the first Round Table of Asian Oil and Gas Ministers. OPEC is also in talks about launching formal dialogue with both China and APEC. Moreover, many leading non-OPEC producers attend OPEC's Ministerial Conferences as observers.

There are some areas of the foreword, however, that require clarification.

First, there is the suggestion that world crude oil production may reach its peak in the next decade. While it is true that oil is a finite resource and that production will peak one day and begin to decline, we are many decades away from this happening. It is an established fact that global proven reserves continue to grow on account of new discoveries, as well as reserve growth resulting from advancing technology and improved recovery. This has been as true in recent years as it has been true throughout the modern history of petroleum. For every barrel of oil consumed since the birth of modern petroleum industry a century and a half ago, there is more than one barrel of oil remaining as proven reserves and almost an equal amount of likely growth of reserves in existing fields, as well as another barrel of oil from future new discoveries. This is not to mention the huge potential from unconventional oil resources, like tar sands in Canada, already under development.

Nonetheless, we must not be complacent. We should continue to sharpen our knowledge and use our existing resources more efficiently. We should also seek to develop new energy sources, side by side with existing ones. There is ample time to do this economically, efficiently and in an orderly fashion.

With regard to other energy sources, the share of gas is rising steadily in the world energy mix, but it will be decades before its total contribution reaches that of oil. In contrast, coal's share is falling steadily. In some consuming countries, there is a rethink about nuclear, but notable increases are not expected for a long time, given the need for enhanced safety and improved safeguards. Renewables constitute an important option that needs to be developed and encouraged at every opportunity; but, in reality, starting from a low base, it is likely to be a long time - decades, rather than years - before renewables acquire a significant share of the world energy mix, even with the most ambitious double-digit growth rates, such as for wind power.

There will be enough oil reserves to meet continued world oil demand growth, which we forecast to reach 110 mb/d by 2025; most of the growth is in developing countries, for the transportation sector. With more than 75 per cent of proven global crude reserves, OPEC itself has the resource base to meet the growing oil requirement for decades to come, to ensure that the market remains well-supplied with crude, at reasonable prices that are compatible with robust growth in the world economy. We are also seeking to produce oil that is cleaner and more efficient than ever before, so as to meet the increasingly stringent demands of the modern consumer in rich and poor countries alike. Sequestrating CO2 in depleting oil fields for the enhanced recovery of oil is one example that can contribute effectively to address the climate change concerns.

OPEC will continue to pursue sound investment strategies, to provide the required oil as and when it is needed. However, many uncertainties make such planning difficult, in an industry where lead times can be very long and capital requirements enormous. Future economic growth rates, consumer government energy and environmental policies, technological advances and the oil price path lie at the heart of these uncertainties. Every effort must be made, therefore, to reduce such uncertainties and share the risks involved among the principal parties in the market. In short, the availability of reserves is not the issue for now; rather, it is more a question of timely deliverability.

Finally, the foreword raises the important issue of security of oil supply. This is a longstanding issue and came to the fore in the 1970s, when market conditions were very different, as were perceptions of events. If one looks back over the past two decades, one would find that, even when there have been supply difficulties in producing countries, OPEC has acted quickly to make good the shortfall in the market.

The last thing oil-producing developing countries want is an unstable oil market. The revenues they receive from petroleum sales are essential for financing their economic and social development, to an extent that may not be fully appreciated by established industrialised nations. This is in addition to the part that must be reinvestment in the upstream to meet rising demand. It is in the best interests of these producing countries to ensure that every possible measure is taken to achieve - and maintain - market stability at all times. The advantages of a sound oil market extend well beyond OPEC's Members, since there are, indeed, more than 30 oil-exporting developing countries, including at least ten in Africa, among them some least-developed countries, and a sound oil market can make a significant contribution to sustainable development and the eradication of poverty in these countries.

With regard to the take from oil, let me point out that, collectively over the past ten years, the G7 countries' oil product tax revenues were higher than the petroleum revenues received by OPEC's Members. Only in 2004 did this picture change somewhat. To put this in context, the combined GDP of all OPEC's Member Countries, with a total population of more than 600 million, is less than that of individual major consuming countries, such as the UK or Italy.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me conclude by emphasizing that, in the 21st century, the undeniable benefits from oil, on development and economic growth, should and can be extended to, and be felt in, the world at large, especially in developing countries, which have, for the most part, missed out on these benefits in the past. To achieve this requires an open, frank approach to dialogue and cooperation among all the parties concerned, based on a careful, objective examination of all the main issues and facts. This is why OPEC welcomes the opportunity to participate in conferences like this, and commends the Pio Manzù Centre for making this possible.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/330-2-nov-2005.html"
"2005-10-20","Summary of the presentation:

This reviews the oil outlook, challenges and opportunities in the early 21st century. It provides assurances of supply security at a time when there has been much market volatility and rising prices, and unprecedented demand growth. There are six sections: current oil market assessment, medium-to-long-term outlook, outlook beyond 2010, reserves/resources, uncertainties and technology.

The current market is characterised by resilient economic growth, and high oil demand growth, in particular from large developing countries with low consumption per capita. Supply chain tightness, particularly downstream, has contributed to a loss of market confidence. OPEC has increased production significantly to help stabilise the market, resulting in global supply exceeding demand for the last three years and rising oil inventories. But geopolitical tensions, hurricanes and other unpredictable events, together with increased activity in futures markets, have translated into significant volatility and rising prices.

In the medium term, OPEC is committed to continuing upstream capacity expansion at an accelerated rate, and this is expected to rise cumulatively by 5.5 million barrels a day to 38 mb/d by the end of 2010, and other liquids by 1.5–1.8 mb/d. OPEC will also add downstream capacity, well in excess of 2 mb/d. Oil supply is thus forecast to stay well above demand, whereas the downstream situation may only improve in 2007, when product demand and refinery capacity expansion could come close together.

Beyond 2010, demand growth will continue rising steadily. OPEC, with nearly four-fifths of proven global reserves, will supply increasingly the incremental barrel. But, despite the upstream investment challenge being not too dissimilar to the past, ensuring market stability will be complicated by considerable uncertainties, such as consuming countries’ energy policies.

The global reserve/resource base can easily meet forecast demand growth for decades to come. Estimates of ultimately recoverable reserves (URR) have increased over time, with advancing technology, enhanced recovery and new reservoir development. For example, according to an established industry source, reserve growth from improved recovery alone in existing fields amounted to 175 billion barrels in 1995–2003; combined with new discoveries of 138 bn b, total reserve growth was therefore well above the cumulative production of 236 bn b for that period. Moreover, technology continues to blur the distinction between conventional and non-conventional oil, of which there is also abundance, as well as with other fossil fuels. We expect the world’s URR to continue to increase in the future. Therefore, the real issue is not reserve availability, but timely deliverability, and here enhanced cooperation and dialogue among all parties is essential to ensure security of demand, as well as security of supply.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/331-20-october-2005.html"
"2005-10-19","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to address this important Seventh Meeting of APEC Energy Ministers.

The theme of the meeting — “Securing APEC’s energy future: responding to today’s challenges for energy supply and demand” — is a very topical one, bearing in mind recent oil market developments. The volatility and high prices have focused attention on what many people see as being the fundamental issue of acquiring secure energy supplies at affordable prices over a long period.

[Slide 2] This reaction is understandable, in particular in such a vast, diverse and energetic region as the Asia-Pacific. On a purchasing power parity basis, the Asia-Pacific houses the world’s three largest economies — the USA, China and Japan. Even on the more established market exchange rate basis, it is USA one, Japan two and, climbing steadily, China five. As the world’s most economically dynamic region, the Asia-Pacific now accounts for around 60 per cent of both global GDP and energy demand. Specifically for oil, the region’s demand of nearly 49 million barrels a day is 59 per cent of the world total of 82 mb/d.

The region already produces large quantities of its own energy, in all the major commercial forms. Indeed, some APEC economies, such as Canada and Russia, are major exporters of oil and gas, which dominate the global energy mix.

[Slide 3] Nevertheless, so large is the region’s energy demand that, overall, it is a net energy importer, and it will become even more of one as demand continues to rise during the first quarter of the 21st century, led by sizable growth in demand for oil in China and in other emerging developing economies in the Asia-Pacific. This contention is substantiated by the big imbalance, in proportionate terms, between the region’s proven hydrocarbon reserves — estimated at 13 per cent of the world’s crude oil reserves and 38 per cent of its gas — and its current production — of around 37 and 58 per cent of global oil and gas respectively.

Such factors highlight the need to respond effectively today’s challenges for energy supply and demand in the Asia-Pacific, and such high-level meetings as this have an important role to play in this process.

For my part, I should now like to present OPEC’s views on this issue and to provide reassurances about the oil supply system to the Asia-Pacific for many years to come. Of course, one of our Member Countries, Indonesia, comes from the region, where it is a prominent producer, as well as consumer, of both oil and gas.

When looking at the current market situation, we see that an unusual combination of factors has been at work over the past couple of years, leading to the persistent price rises and volatility. We have also observed a shift in the focus from the upstream to the downstream.

[Slides 4–6] The spotlight was initially on the upstream, with the unexpectedly high oil demand growth in 2003 and its acceleration to exceptional levels in 2004. This was connected, in particular, to the high level of economic growth of two APEC members, China and the USA. It was exacerbated by a notable development on the supply side, when the growth in non-OPEC supply started to fall behind that of world oil demand, reversing earlier trends of matching or exceeding demand growth. However, during the course of last year, it became steadily apparent that the destabilising forces lay more — and increasingly — in the downstream than in the upstream, and this trend has continued to the present day.

[Slide 7] Indeed, this year, while demand growth has remained at healthy, though more modest and sustainable levels, the challenge of providing adequate crude supply is being met successfully. This has been largely due to OPEC’s actions, raising its production by more than 4.5 mb/d since 2003, as part of its market-stabilisation measures. This has, in turn, led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks, which are now exceeding their five-year average.

[Slide 8] OPEC has also been acting on a second front. Recognising that the high levels of oil demand growth — of about 1.5 mb/d per year — are likely to remain at least in the medium term, our Member Countries have sought to accelerate their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity. [Slide 9] This is to re-establish a comfortable level of capacity and help calm markets during the present troubled period. This means that spare capacity — which is now at 2.0 mb/d — will be more than adequate to cover oil demand growth throughout this winter and in 2006, with the call on OPEC only slightly higher than in 2005. Furthermore, much of OPEC’s new capacity in the coming years will consist of lighter crudes, which are much in demand in the market. More increases in capacity have been planned — and are being implemented — for the rest of the decade.

Also, next year is expected to see non-OPEC oil supply growth recover to 1.3 mb/d from the exceptionally low level of 0.5 mb/d witnessed this year — and, as with OPEC, there will be a focus on lighter crudes. [Slide 10] On balance, we expect annual average growth of around 1 mb/d in non-OPEC supply up to 2010, slowing thereafter. Combined with the planned increase in OPEC capacity from 32.5 mb/d to more than 38 mb/d by 2010 and an additional 1.5 mb/d increase in natural gas liquids over the same period, this means that cumulative world oil production capacity will rise by around 12 mb/d or more, over the next five years. This will be well above the expected cumulative rise in demand of 7–8 mb/d over the same period, and thus it will more than cover the forecast growth in demand.

Also, the fact that the market has, over the past two years, experienced and successfully handled a serious spare capacity limitation, together with the fact that the greater revenues generated by the recent higher oil prices have allowed more funds for reinvestment in the industry — compared with the under-investment in new capacity that occurred previously when prices were much lower — is a very positive sign for the assurance of crude oil sufficiency well beyond the opening decade of this century.

[Slides 11–12] There is a different picture downstream, however.

The continued serious downstream bottlenecks in some major consuming countries — due mainly to a lack of timely investment and to increasingly stringent product specifications motivated by environmental concerns — have seen refineries operating at near capacity to keep pace with rising demand. Not only is this putting pressure on product prices, but its effects are also felt subsequently on crude prices, especially light, sweet blends. Indeed, we saw last month how world crude oil prices were far less affected than product prices by the disruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to the US Gulf Coast. Clearly, the industry at large must pay more attention to the downstream part of the supply-chain, in the interests of overall market stability. [Slide 13] In particular, concrete measures should be taken on the part of the governments in consuming countries, to create an enabling environment to encourage rapid, sizeable investments in the refining sector, especially in conversion capacity, which has persistently lagged behind market requirements.

Downstream investment, however, is primarily the responsibility of the domestic and international oil companies in consuming countries. Without adequate and timely measures from that side of the industry, today’s high and volatile oil prices are likely to remain a feature of the market. [Slide 14] In this context, it should be noted that the recent large revenue increases of the international oil companies have not yet been visibly translated into substantial additional investment, and this includes the upstream, as well as the downstream. Here I refer to reports of refiners’ returns more than tripling over the past 12 months, compared with 45 per cent gains for crude producers.

[Slide 15] OPEC’s Member Countries, although traditionally associated more with the upstream, have themselves taken the initiative — on their own and in partnership with others — to invest in downstream projects as well. Nevertheless, looking at the overall picture, as it stands now, it does not appear that the growth in refinery capacity will match demand growth before 2007.

[Slide 16] On top of all this, there has been widespread concern about possible future supply disruptions that may result from increased geopolitical tensions or other causes. These factors — taken together — have been reflected in increased speculation in futures markets, particularly through a rise in activity by non-commercials, notably pension and trust funds, which has, in turn, resulted in a rise in open commitments; both have correlated strongly with the price increases of the last two years. Without any doubt, due largely to the perceived capacity constraints, the market has become very nervous and over-responsive to external impulses.

Let me at this point make a few additional observations about the present higher prices. First, there is no doubt that part of the increased levels is a reflection of a shift in market fundamentals, and, as with any transitional phase, this may not be a totally smooth process — as has, indeed, already proven to be the case in the sensitive market environment of oil. The extent and magnitude of such a shift in fundamentals will become clearer with the passage of time. Undoubtedly, however, widely expressed concern about future supply, again fed and amplified by worries about persistent product shortages in the coming years, is itself putting upward pressure on prices.

On a broader scale, the global economy has so far shown remarkable resilience to the price rises — a fact acknowledged by such financial institutions as the International Monetary Fund. However, we must not be complacent, as signs of an impact on some economies are beginning to appear, especially on emerging economies with large fuel subsidies. And, while this is a matter of much concern to us, we must nonetheless point out that the situation is very different to what it was several decades ago.

[Slide 17] First, in real terms, crude oil prices, although high, are still well below levels reached in the early 1980s. And secondly, the world is decreasingly dependant on oil for its economic growth. Globally, oil intensity — the amount of oil required for a pre-defined unit of GDP — has fallen by around 50 per cent since 1970, due to such factors as technology, improved efficiency, government policies and changing consumer behaviour. This means, for example, that, in the world’s largest economy, the USA, consumers — even with the present high crude prices — are paying an estimated three per cent of their disposable income on gasoline and oil, compared with around 4.5 per cent a quarter of a century ago.

And last, but by no means least — on the subject of prices — it must be stressed time and time again that OPEC does not welcome prices that remain out of line with market fundamentals. These will contain within themselves the seeds of further volatility, and this will be detrimental to the steady flow of petroleum revenue that is essential for investment in domestic socio-economic development, as well as reinvestment in the industry. This is why OPEC goes to great lengths to promote order and stability in the oil market, with secure supply, steady, predictable demand, reasonable prices and fair returns for investors.

[Slide 18] OPEC’s commitment to stability applies equally to the long term. This was underlined once again in Vienna last month, when OPEC’s Ministerial Conference adopted a comprehensive long-term strategy, to provide a coherent and consistent vision and framework to guide our future actions.

[Slide 19] The strategy explicitly recognises the important role of oil in the world economy at large in the future, recalls and delineates further the objectives of the Organization, identifies the key challenges it faces now and in the future, and explores scenarios for the energy scene. In doing so, it covers such important elements as the oil price, upstream and downstream investment, technology, the role of OPEC national oil companies, multilateral agreements and negotiations related to energy, and the relationships with both producers and consumers, as well as with international organisations and institutions.

Regarding oil prices, the strategy builds upon the fundamental recognition that extreme price levels, either too high or too low, are damaging for both producers and consumers, and it points to the need to be proactive under all market conditions. It also re-emphasises OPEC’s commitment to support market stability and, in achieving this, stresses the role of other producers, as well as, especially with regard to the downstream sector, consuming countries. Hence, the dialogue among producers, and between producers and consumers, constitutes a crucial element of the strategy, which recommends that such dialogue should be widened and deepened to cover more issues of mutual concern, such as security of demand and supply, market stability, investment, technology and the downstream, as well as policy.

OPEC’s adoption of such a comprehensive long-term strategy should be highly reassuring for the market at large. This should be especially the case here in the Asia-Pacific, which, as I noted earlier, is already a net importer of energy and is expected to become even more of one in the future, as demand continues its inexorable rise.

[Slide 20] According to our own forecasts at a global level — based on the reference case scenario from the OPEC World Energy Model — world oil demand is expected to continue to rise in the early decades of the 21st century, with annual growth averaging 1.5 per cent up to 2025, when demand will reach 113 mb/d. [Slide 21] During this period, non-OPEC output is expected to reach a plateau of 55–57 mb/d after 2010. This will mean that the call on OPEC oil will increase substantially, with the Organization’s output, including natural gas liquids, rising by more than 70 per cent to 57 mb/d in 2025, compared with 33 mb/d in 2005. By then, according to this scenario, OPEC’s market share will have penetrated the 50 per cent barrier, from around 40 per cent now.

[Slide 22] Even though the numbers involved are very large, the global resource availability is not a constraint. OPEC itself has the reserves to meet the growing oil requirement, to ensure that the market remains well-supplied with crude at all times, at reasonable prices that are compatible with robust growth in the world economy. However, for geological reasons, OPEC will increasingly be accessing reserves that are on the heavier side, and therefore future refineries will have to be designed and equipped to process these into the more highly demanded lighter products. The Organization is committed to maintaining and developing sound investment strategies, and it will see that these are put into effect, in a timely and sufficient manner, to provide the required production capacity for oil that is cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before. In pursuing such strategies, Member Countries will choose the models of collaboration with the international oil industry that best suit their particular environments.

But there are many uncertainties which make sound investment planning a hazardous business, in an industry where the lead times can be very long and the capital requirements enormous. Future economic growth rates, consumer government energy and environmental policies, technological advances and the oil price path lie at the heart of these uncertainties. Over-investment implies heavy costs to be borne by producers, while under-investment will lead to severe price movements.

Massive sums can be involved in such uncertainty. We can illustrate this by looking at two contrasting, but feasible scenarios recently explored by OPEC. One is a tight market scenario, whose characteristics are similar to what we have been experiencing recently, while the other is a soft market scenario with low demand growth and high non-OPEC supply, and hence low OPEC supply and oil prices. These scenarios show differences of around 10 or 11 mb/d in world oil demand within a decade and a half, and the implications of such uncertainty for investment requirements are obvious. Thus every effort must be made to reduce uncertainties and share the risks involved. As the Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, HE Ali I. Naimi, said in Johannesburg last month: “The problem we face is not one of availability, but a problem of deliverability.”

All of this is more than just a question of quantity, however. Crucially, it also involves quality. It is necessary for producers everywhere to bring the right type of oil to the market, as and when required. This includes, for example, the production and use of cleaner petroleum-based fuels and the development of technologies that address climate change concerns, such as carbon dioxide sequestration, which, when combined with enhanced oil recovery, could truly lead to a “win-win” situation.

[Slide 23] Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

It is the responsibility of all parties in the oil market to ensure its steady, orderly evolution in the opening decades of the 21st century. This should be to the benefit of the world community at large, to people from all nations, rich and poor. Just as oil played a key role in enhancing the development of the industrialised countries in the 20th century, so it should now also support economic growth in the developing world.

Dialogue and cooperation have an important role to play in this, together with a steadfast constructive approach to meeting the challenges that face us in the years ahead. As the OPEC President, HE Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, said in Vienna last month, dialogue is “no longer with just producer and consumer; (it is) with everybody.”

"2005-09-28","Dr Shihab-Eldin addressed the five following themes.

1. OPEC-IEA cooperation: the recent past and now

3. Tightness in the supply chain: what has been done and what more should be done?
4. Oil outlook and future challenges: where do OPEC and the IEA agree and disagree?
5. Looking ahead: areas to enhance existing active cooperation

1. OPEC-IEA cooperation: the recent past and now

• Much has changed since the first-ever joint press conference was held between OPEC and the International Energy Agency (IEA) at the World Petroleum Congress in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 5 September 2002. Former IEA Executive Director Robert Priddle said on that occasion: “We speak for oil consumers everywhere; but we also have major oil producers as our members. A good watch-dog can see both sides of the fence.” OPEC is, of course, a group of major oil-producing/exporting developing countries; we speak for most, if not all producers — even those in producing provinces in developed countries! Our membership includes some of the largest oil-consuming developing countries as well; so we can appreciate, directly from within, the needs and concerns of consumers — as we should. Nevertheless, we must engage the broader spectrum of consumers in both developed and developing countries. That is why we have been keen on expanding our dialogue and cooperation with major consuming groups, the IEA, the European Union, China and others, and are seeking to strengthen the role of the specialist producer-consumer dialogue body, the International Energy Forum Secretariat (IEFS), in facilitating this global dialogue.

• The OPEC President, HE Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, made this point succinctly when he said in Vienna last week that dialogue was “no longer with just producer and consumer; (it is) with everybody.” (HE Sheikh Al-Sabah, who is also Kuwait’s Minister of Energy, was addressing the press conference held at the conclusion of the 137th Meeting of the OPEC Conference on 20 September).

• Mr Priddle also said at the joint press conference three years ago that the IEA and OPEC shared many views about the future of world energy and that communication between the two groups was now “open and frank”. However, there were still some differences, he added. For example, while both sides wanted greater price stability, “we agree on the objective … but not on the means.” The need for price stability and working jointly to maintain and enhance this is more evident today than in the past!

• As part of the consumer/producer dialogue, OPEC and the IEA now contact each other at many formal and informal levels, to exchange ideas and information and generally enhance the well-being of the oil industry and oil market stability. There have been three joint OPEC/IEA workshops, on investment (twice) and the Middle East/North Africa region, and a fourth is planned for 2006, on future demand. There have been high-level consultations in difficult market conditions, such as in 2003, with the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq, and over the recent past, to help calm markets after the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. Such actions have had immediate beneficial results for the market, and this has been recognised by the market and governments. There has, moreover, been much regular contact on such technical matters as the Joint Oil Data Initiative (JODI), which also involves other major intergovernmental organisations, and this will henceforth benefit from the overall coordination of the IEFS in Riyadh.

• Clearly such enhanced dialogue and cooperation have led to much greater understanding between the two groups and among their members, building upon areas of agreement and helping take a more pragmatic and harmonious approach to handling issues where fundamental differences remain.

• Improved understanding of, and common perspectives on, some of the issues have led some to mistakenly confuse the main interests and the responsibilities of the two groups. A case in point concerns the recent OPEC/IEA consultations and complementary actions, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Here I refer to the official communiqué from the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC this past weekend, which stated: “The Committee welcomes the action by members of the International Energy Agency and oil-producing countries to continue to increase supplies to the market.”

2. Current oil market developments: factors behind the oil price rises and OPEC responses

1. No doubt, the key driving force behind much of the of recent and present oil market behaviour, with its unrelenting price increases and volatility, is tightness across the supply chain, on account of strong economic growth and the consequent unanticipated oil demand surge, especially in 2004.

2. Upstream, the tightness has been further pressured recently by oil production problems, for technical, political and natural reasons (e.g. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita).

3. But, while upstream tightness has stabilised and the market is set to regain more comfortable spare capacity in the years to come, thanks to the acceleration in investment by OPEC and other producers, the focus now is more on the downstream, with the growth in refining capacity lagging behind demand and with refinery bottlenecks — as well as with the need to meet a wave of strict new regulations, mainly environment-based, in leading consumer markets. There is no sign of improvement before 2007 at the earliest, however.

4. The recent persistent price increases and volatility are attributed mainly to:

* The upward pressures on prices in such a tight market situation — with the expected prolonged downstream bottlenecks — in particular, prices of light products and related benchmark crudes, like West Texas Intermediate;
* Concern about future supply, again fed and amplified by worries about future product shortages;
* (Leading to) greater speculative activity in futures markets, and hence upward cycles of increased prices and volatility.

Clearly, the market remains nervous, over-responsive and out of line with fundamentals.

Acknowledging this, Mr Randal K. Quarles, US Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, said in Washington DC last week that official regulators should undertake a more comprehensive review of hedge fund activities — this was the first time a US Treasury spokesman had endorsed official German anxieties over hedge fund activities and their impact on prices.

While real prices remain below the levels of the early 1980s, and although the global economy has, so far, shown remarkable resilience to the price rises, we should not be complacent. Signs of impact on some economies are beginning to appear, especially in developing countries, and it would be better for all of us to combine our efforts and work harder to moderate prices. Here again, we share a common perspective with regard to the objective, but have differing views on what constitutes a comfortable price level for both producers and consumers and, more importantly, on the means of achieving this.

On the OPEC side, our response to these market developments reflects our commitment to market stability and concern about the persistent price rises. We have acted on two broad fronts:

1. Big production increases, to ensure the market remains well-supplied with crude and that commercial inventories are at comfortable levels:
• OPEC’s production ceiling has been raised by a total of 4.5 million barrels a day since spring 2004;
• There have been actual increases in OPEC production of more than 4.5 mb/d since 2003;
• Last week (20 September), the OPEC Conference announced that it would make immediately available to the market all the current 2 mb/d spare capacity, if called for in the final quarter.

These actions have resulted in OECD commercial stocks, especially crude, being well above their five-year average, enabling the market to deal with, for example, the post-Katrina crude supply disruptions in the US Gulf.

2. Accelerated capacity expansion programmes, to restore a comfortable spare capacity cushion as soon as possible. The current spare capacity on-stream is 2 mb/d.

3. Tightness in the supply chain: what has been done and what more should be done?

As previously stated, OPEC Member Countries have embarked on significant investments, both upstream and downstream, to ensure that the world economy is benefiting from regular, secure oil supplies. A substantial upstream capacity expansion in these countries is underway, extending to 2010, with crude production capacity expected to exceed 38 mb/d by 2010, from the current 32.5 mb/d.

Moreover, Member Countries have undertaken, on their own, downstream investment both at home and abroad (mainly joint ventures). This will result in more than 2 mb/d of additional refining capacity in the coming years.

Nevertheless, downstream investment is primarily the responsibility of consuming countries and the international oil companies (IOCs).

The recent large revenue increases of the IOCs over the last two years have not yet been visibly translated into substantial additional investment, particularly in the downstream. The Washington Post issue of 25 September showed that, in the USA, as a result of the most recent increase in the price of gasoline to the final consumer, crude producers are gaining around 45 per cent over their take of the year before, while refiners have gained more than 250 per cent in the same period. While this may, indeed, be a “snapshot” in one location on a particular day, the overall picture nevertheless remains valid.

There have been some encouraging signs of late from some of the majors, but more evidence of a turnaround is needed and needed quickly.

Downstream investment should be large, rapid and focus on lighter, cleaner products; this means refineries must be able to better handle heavy, sour crude, as this becomes increasingly abundant. If this does not happen, the downstream sector will remain a source of tightness and volatility for years to come.

We are encouraged by the recent acknowledgement by consuming countries of refinery bottlenecks and tightening capacity as being key contributors to current market turbulence:
• G-8 meeting in June;
• IMF International Monetary and Financial Committee communiqué The G-7 group, specifically, calls for more exploration and production, greater refining capacity and better energy infrastructure;
• The IEA have also underlined the importance of this factor in their recent statements.

This is one area where it is clear that we now share same perspective. But we believe the consuming countries must go one step further, by taking immediate action to create an enabling environment to encourage rapid and sizable investment in the expansion and upgrading of refinery systems, to handle, in particular, heavy and sour crudes that will constitute the major part of new oil additions, the 2006 exception notwithstanding.

Further, we believe there is a need for major consuming countries to re-examine their fiscal, energy and environmental policies, with a view to better harmonising and rationalising them with economic growth policies.

4. Oil outlook and future challenges: where do OPEC and the IEA agree and disagree?

• General While it is clear from the recent exchanges between the two groups that OPEC and the IEA hold similar views on many topical oil market issues, there are still distinct differences in some areas, stemming from the fact that OPEC’s principal objective is to address the interests of oil-producing, developing countries, while that of the IEA concerns primarily oil-consuming, developed countries. But OPEC has always known that, in order to further its own interests, it is necessary to understand and to accommodate the interests of consumers, ensuring steady and economic supply of oil. This then ties in closely with the greatly increased readiness of both sides for effective dialogue and cooperation on major topical issues that relate to the oil market.

• As highlighted yesterday by HE Ali I. Naimi, the Saudi Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, the key challenge facing the oil industry is not of availability — for the resource base is acknowledged by all serious industry officials as being sufficient to meet the rising demand for many decades to come. Rather, the challenge is one of deliverability. He underlined the need for collaborative international efforts to address the challenges and overcome the constraints across the supply chain.

• Long-term issues There is agreement on the fact that resource availability is not a constraint for the foreseeable future, as well as on the importance of timely and adequate investment to meet future demand. We agree also on the need for making efficient use of this valuable, but ultimately depletable resource and that technology can provide an attractive path to increase supplies of clean fuels, while reducing concern over potential climate change. However, differences remain on such issues as level of investment, the linkage between security of supply and demand (in particular, factors that lead to high uncertainty over future demand levels), upstream access, the path to economic diversification into other energy sources, government involvement, and so on.

• Different interpretations/views on the approach to energy security Let us recall that OPEC had ample spare capacity just a few years ago and used it effectively to address the strengthened and rising global demand. Recently, we have accelerated expansion of our production capacity, which, when combined with an allowance for reasonable expansion by non-OPEC over the medium term, up to 2010, should be more than enough to meet demand and leave a comfortable cushion of spare capacity. For the long term, producers have ample resources and stand ready — and interested — to continue to invest, once they are sure of the demand picture.

• Therefore, security of demand is as important for producing countries as security of supply is for consuming countries. Thus the various ways of achieving the energy security objective through efficiency, diversification or alternative fuels, according to government policy, should not lead, for example, to a bias against a single source, which would, in turn, lead to an unpredictable environment for oil demand — especially at a time when producers are engaged in making timely and costly investments. In other words, the policy decisions of consuming countries should not lead to an environment that feeds into demand insecurity, thus undermining the supply security itself. Otherwise, wild boom and bust cycles will remain a feature of the future energy scene.

5. Looking ahead: areas to enhance existing active cooperation

• Build upon and develop existing joint practices

- Consultation on best approaches to handle oil market crises
- Joint workshops
- Joint Oil Data Initiative
- Exchanging data and information

• Explore and develop new areas

- One area is energy technology co-operation. Joint research into areas of mutual interest e.g. cleaner oil technologies, carbon capture with enhanced oil recovery. OPEC is currently looking into participation in IEA greenhouse gas research and development (R&D).
- Here, it may be appropriate to call on all oil and gas producers to consider initiating a strong global R&D programme to explore fully the potential of carbon capture and storage in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery with “win-win” potential. OPEC’s recently adopted long-term strategy (at its 137th Conference last week) called for increasing international collaboration in this very promising technology.
- There could also be a more pro-active approach to examining outstanding areas of fundamental difference. Understanding and improving global demand forecasts constitutes another key area that needs global cooperation. The planned OPEC-IEA workshop on demand in 2006 may provide the basis for an expanded global effort that may be pursued by the IEFS, to complement the important study of the global oil supply system proposed by HE Naimi.

Conclusion

Dialogue among producers and between producers and consumers constitutes a crucial element of OPEC’s long-term strategy. It is recommended that such dialogue should be widened and deepened to cover more issues of mutual concern, such as security of demand and supply, market stability, investment, technology and the downstream.

Finally, genuine dialogue is the key to looking forward. Cooperation should be pursued by taking into consideration the concerns of all parties, with growing interdependence. It is recommended, in this context, that policy options on important issues should not be developed or applied in isolation.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/333-28-september-2005.html"
"2005-09-24","OPEC reaffirms its longstanding commitment to oil market stability. Too high or too low oil prices are damaging to both producers and consumers. OPEC calls for all parties to contribute to such stability, with reasonable prices that are acceptable to producers and consumers alike, consistent with healthy economic growth, that provide steady revenue streams for petroleum-exporting countries as well as fair returns for investors, and that are conducive to the timely and appropriate expansion of upstream and downstream capacity to meet rising international demand for oil.

In 2004, oil prices rose sharply as a result of the convergence of a number of factors, in particular strong and synchronised global economic growth, leading to an exceptional rise in the demand for oil. In 2005, despite sufficient supply and growing oil inventories, prices continued to increase, mostly due to tightness in the downstream sector, especially the lack of appropriate refinery capacities, such as conversion units, compounded by concerns over availability of adequate future supplies. This has been exacerbated by increased activity in futures markets and, more recently, by severe weather-related events, such as Hurricane Katrina, with its tragic consequences.

Since 2003, there has been a significant increase in OPEC’s production by more than 4.5 million barrels a day (mb/d), to help satisfy the increased demand for oil, ensure adequate inventory levels and compensate for the noticeable decline in non-OPEC output growth, while accelerating the expansion of crude oil production capacity to meet future rises in demand and maintain sufficient spare capacity.

In addition, this week, at the 137th Meeting of its Conference in Vienna, OPEC, to reassure the market, agreed to make immediately available to the market the spare capacity of around two million barrels a day in Member Countries, should it be called for. This decision has been made, despite there being ample crude oil supplies with inventory levels above their five-year average. Moreover, OPEC Member Countries have embarked on significant investments, both upstream and downstream, to ensure that the world economy is benefiting from regular and secure oil supplies. In this connection, they are implementing costly investment plans to expand crude oil production capacity from about 32.5 mb/d to at least 38 mb/d by 2010. Also, the progressive recovery of Iraq should significantly contribute to raising OPEC’s overall production capacity.

It is clear, however, that the present tightness in the downstream sector, especially the lack of adequate refining capacity, will continue to put pressure on prices; consequently, volatility is likely to remain a feature of the oil market for some time, until the necessary investments are undertaken. The recent behaviour of the oil market, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, provides a good illustration of the critical importance of the refining sector to market stability. In this regard, OPEC Member Countries have taken the initiative - on their own and in partnership with others, both inside and outside their countries - to pursue and invest in downstream projects. Nevertheless, the primary responsibility for refining capacity expansion remains with the major consuming countries. OPEC calls for these countries to create the appropriate environment and provide the necessary incentives to ensure timely and sufficient investments in this key sector. In this regard, the role of the international oil companies is also crucial. It is of note that recent increases in revenue have not been translated substantially into additional investments, despite the needs of, in particular, the downstream sector.

The world economy has so far shown remarkable resilience to high energy and commodity prices. Nevertheless, OPEC continues to express concern over the possible impact of further sustained price increases on the world economy, and especially on the economies of developing countries. Signs of such an impact appear to be emerging. OPEC will continue to help moderate crude oil prices by increasing production and capacity. At the same time, consuming countries should also do their part, including adopting measures to ease the burden of high fuel prices on the final consumer. OPEC is encouraged by recent actions that have been taken by some consuming countries in this direction.

Dialogue and cooperation between all parties is all the more important today. It has always been the cornerstone of OPEC policy, and will continue to be so in the future. OPEC welcomes all the initiatives that lead to strengthening such dialogue and cooperation, for the benefit of all.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/334-24-september-2005.html"
"2005-09-21","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to deliver this keynote address to this year’s Oil and Money Conference. The main theme of the Conference, the capacity challenge, is a very topical one at the present time and one to which OPEC is devoting much attention. I should, therefore, like to present OPEC’s views on this important matter and to reassure the market that OPEC is committed to secure, stable supply with reasonable prices, at all times. Here let me emphasise that the recent high prices have been primarily product-driven, as the market has increasingly felt the pressure of refinery expansion lagging behind current oil demand growth estimates, with a particular lack of conversion capacity additions, of which I will speak more later.

OPEC’s commitment to market stability was clear from our two-day Ministerial Conference, which ended in Vienna yesterday — coincidentally, just one week after the 45th anniversary of our Organization! We examined the current situation in the international oil market very carefully and reminded ourselves that there have been two distinct aspects in the prevailing volatility and high prices.

2003 began with strong oil demand growth, which then accelerated to exceptional levels in 2004. While growth has remained at healthy, although at more modest and sustainable levels this year, the challenge of providing adequate crude supply has been met successfully. This has been largely due to OPEC’s actions, in raising its production ceiling on several occasions during this period, by a total of 4.5 million barrels a day. This has, in turn, led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks, which are exceeding their five-year average. OPEC output is now estimated at a satisfactory 30.2 mb/d.

OPEC has also been acting on a second front, with regard to its market-stabilisation measures. In the light of the surge in demand, an initial consequence of OPEC’s increase in output was a reduction in its spare capacity, particularly in 2004. Therefore, given that the high levels of oil demand growth of the past two years, particularly in China and other emerging developing economies, appear likely to remain at least in the medium term — even if this is at more modest levels — OPEC’s Member Countries have sought to accelerate their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity, currently at 2.0 mb/d. This is to re-establish a comfortable level of capacity, to help calm markets at a time when demand is expected to continue growing strongly.

This means that capacity will be more than adequate to cover oil demand growth throughout this winter and in 2006, with the call on OPEC only slightly higher than in 2005. It should be able to accommodate sudden, unexpected cutbacks in supply, just as it did when Hurricane Katrina caused an immediate loss of about 95 per cent of US Gulf Coast crude oil production. Furthermore, much of the new capacity from both OPEC and non-OPEC will in 2006 — luckily — consist of lighter crudes, which are in much demand in the market. More increases in capacity have been planned (and are being implemented) for the rest of the decade.

Let me say a few words here about the impact of Hurricane Katrina — from a market perspective and notwithstanding our deepest sympathy for all those people who suffered loss of family, friends, property and livelihoods. This tragic event demonstrated OPEC’s readiness to respond to crises in a timely, considered and effective manner, with our Member Countries pledging prompt provisions of oil and fuel supplies to help deal with the immediate severe impact on the region and its population.

However, although there has been considerable damage to the producing and refining facilities in the US Gulf Coast region, we think it is unlikely that this — on its own — could lead to a major energy crisis, given healthy levels of commercial oil stocks, especially crude, and taking into account also the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) announced release of member country government stocks; these, together with the efforts of the producers, have contributed positively, we believe, to calming the market. We understand that, already, more than half a million barrels a day of the region’s crude output have been restored and that the situation will continue to improve, although the precise time-frame for this is somewhat uncertain — months at most, not years. Having said that, the chief problem remains that it is expected to be a long time before the region’s refinery centres return to full operations, and this is adding to the already considerable strains in the global refinery system. More about the downstream in a minute.

I should like to make one more comment about the situation upstream. This relates to non-OPEC supply. For the third year in a row, the growth in non-OPEC supply has been falling behind that of world oil demand, reversing earlier trends of matching or exceeding demand growth, and this tendency is expected to continue for at least a while longer, although 2006 will see growth recover to 1.1 mb/d from the exceptionally low level of 0.6 mb/d witnessed this year on account of many factors (Russia, the North Sea, the USA). Nevertheless, while some non-OPEC producers have been experiencing absolute declines in production in recent years, others have been seeing their output grow. On balance, we expect annual average growth of around 1 mb/d in non-OPEC supply up to 2010, slowing thereafter. Combined with the planned increase in OPEC capacity from 32.5 mb/d to more than 38 mb/d by 2010 and an additional 1.5 mb/d increase in natural gas liquids over the same period, this means that cumulative world oil production capacity will rise by around 12 mb/d over the next five years, well above the expected cumulative rise in demand of 7–8 mb/d over the same period, and thus it will more than cover the forecast growth in demand.

The second distinct aspect in the prevailing volatility and high prices occurs downstream. While the situation upstream has stabilized and is expected to improve, as explained above, there is a different picture downstream. The continued serious downstream bottlenecks in some major consuming countries — due mainly to a lack of timely investment and to increasingly stringent product specifications motivated by environmental concerns — have seen refineries operating at near capacity to keep pace with rising demand, putting pressure on not only product prices, but also crude prices. This has been particularly apparent in the post-Katrina market, with average OECD refinery utilisation above 90 per cent and some regions close to 95 per cent.

It is clear, therefore, that the industry at large — especially in consuming countries — must pay more attention to the downstream part of the supply-chain, in the interests of overall market stability. In particular, concrete measures should be taken to encourage rapid and sizeable investments in the refining sector, especially in conversion capacity, which has persistently lagged behind market requirements. This is a challenge that should be addressed urgently. It also includes conforming to the new product specifications. Though their primary responsibility is in the upstream, OPEC Member Countries have taken the initiative — on their own and in partnership with others — to invest in downstream projects. However, without adequate and timely measures in the main consuming countries, today’s high and volatile oil prices are likely to remain a feature of the market. As it stands now, it does not appear that the growth in refinery capacity will match demand growth before 2007.

On top of all this, there has been widespread concern about possible future supply disruptions that may result from increased geopolitical tensions. These factors have been reflected in increased speculation in futures markets, particularly through a rise in activity by non-commercials, notably pension and trust funds. Without any doubt, due largely to the perceived capacity constraints, the market has become very nervous and over-responsive to external impulses, and price levels cannot be justified by crude oil fundamentals alone. Indeed, a clear and strong correlation has existed between oil prices and both “open commitment” and trade volumes in NYMEX oil futures in recent years. Nevertheless, in real terms, crude oil prices, although high, are still well below levels reached in the early 1980s.

Clearly, there are no winners from such a situation. Excessive market volatility can have an adverse effect on activities at all levels within the industry and, ultimately, have negative repercussions for both producers and consumers. It can, in particular, be highly detrimental to investment in future production capacity, as indeed it can for domestic development in oil-producing countries. If prices are so high that they cannot be sustained, they may well be followed by very low prices and reduced revenues not long afterwards — just as occurred in the 1980s, with dramatic consequences for our Member Countries and their aspirations to sound, sustained economic and social development.

Turning to the world economy, it appears that the recent high oil prices have, so far, had little impact on global economic growth, which continues to be robust, a sign that the world economy has become less sensitive to oil price increases than it was three decades ago. However, we must not be complacent! There are signs that, if the current price levels persist, they will begin to affect some economies; indeed, they are already starting to affect some developing countries in Asia and Latin America.

Therefore, in the light of all this, our Ministerial Conference yesterday reiterated that OPEC would continue its proactive policy of supporting market stability by ensuring availability of adequate supply, at prices reasonable to both producers and consumers. This would be, notably, for the benefit of the world economy, including, in particular, the economies of the developing world. The Conference therefore agreed to make available to the market the spare capacity of around 2 mb/d in Member Countries, should it be called for, for a period of three months, starting 1 October. It further decided to review market developments at an Extraordinary Meeting, to be held in Kuwait on 12 December, and to take decisions deemed appropriate and necessary.

At the same time, our Conference called on all other parties in the industry to join its efforts to maintain market stability, with reasonable prices consistent with robust economic growth, as well as steady revenue streams, for producing countries and the industry, conducive to the expansion of upstream and downstream capacity to meet rising international demand for crude oil and products. It also welcomed recent actions taken by consuming countries to ease the burden of higher fuel prices on the final consumer.

So far, I have only spoken about the supply challenge for the near term. However, OPEC is equally committed to the achievement of market order and stability in the future.

Indeed, at our Ministerial Conference this week, OPEC adopted a comprehensive long-term strategy, to provide a coherent and consistent vision and framework for the Organization’s future. The strategy defines specific objectives for the Organization, identifies the key challenges it faces now and in the future, and explores scenarios for the energy scene. It is designed to be robust and adaptive throughout the various possible futures.

According to the reference case scenario from OPEC’s World Energy Model, world oil demand will continue to rise in the early decades of the 21st century, at an average annual growth rate of 1.5 per cent up to 2025, reaching 113 mb/d. With non-OPEC output expected to reach a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period, OPEC will be meeting nearly half the world’s oil demand in 20 years’ time, according to this scenario.

This is an awesome challenge, but OPEC has the resources to meet the growing oil requirement, to ensure that the market remains well-supplied with crude at all times, at reasonable prices that are compatible with robust growth in the world economy. The Organization is, indeed, committed to maintaining and developing sound investment strategies, and will see that these are put into effect, in a timely and sufficient manner, to provide the required production capacity for oil that is cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before. Moreover, OPEC’s long-term strategy envisages an enhanced role for its Member Countries’ national oil companies in this, as well as developing close cooperation among themselves in such areas as technology, industrial networks and knowledge- and experience-sharing.

But there are many uncertainties which make sound investment planning a hazardous business, in an industry where the lead times can be very long and the capital requirements enormous. Future economic growth rates, consumer government energy and environmental policies, technological advances and the oil price path lie at the heart of these uncertainties. Over-investment implies heavy costs to be borne by producers, while under-investment will lead to severe price movements. Thus every effort must be made to reduce uncertainties and to share the risks involved.

Increasingly, attention is being turned to long-term investment in the downstream, an issue that has been brought into focus by the short-term bottlenecks. The move towards demand for ever lighter and cleaner products represents a significant challenge for the downstream sector, and substantial investment will be required to meet this in the years ahead. If the required investment does not take place in a timely manner, this sector will remain a source of tightness and volatility.

All this reinforces the case for the continued enhancement of the process of dialogue and cooperation within the oil industry, involving producers, consumers and the international oil companies. As the OPEC President, HE Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, said in Vienna yesterday, dialogue is “no longer with just producer and consumer; (it is) with everybody.” OPEC has and will continue to play its role in ensuring a sufficiency of crude. It is up to the international oil companies to shoulder their responsibility by investing their current large profits in upstream and, in particular, downstream projects. Consumer governments’ responsibilities lie in encouraging more rapid investment in downstream projects, harmonizing their economic, energy and environmental policies, and examining their fiscal policies — noting that taxes today represent more than 60 per cent of the cost of products to consumers in most OECD countries.

Our Organization welcomes the continuation of consultations between OPEC and the IEA, as well as noting the increasing effectiveness of the International Energy Forum as a platform for global dialogue. We are also very satisfied with the recently established OPEC/European Union dialogue, and we are ready to enter into similar dialogues with other regional and international bodies.

However, although much welcome progress has been made in this area in recent years, OPEC’s long-term strategy recommends that dialogue should be widened and deepened to cover more substantive issues of mutual concern, such as security of demand and supply, market stability, investment, technology and the downstream.

The strategy calls for OPEC Member Countries to strengthen cooperation in upstream and downstream scientific research and technological development among themselves and with institutions. It advocates supporting research in the production and use of cleaner petroleum-based fuels and taking an active role in the development of technologies that address climate change concerns, while improving and expanding the role of oil in meeting future world energy demand, such as carbon dioxide sequestration.

Let me close by saying that we must accept the fact that natural or man-made events, that can interfere with production capacity across the supply chain, can happen at any time, as was vividly illustrated by Hurricane Katrina. This underlines the importance of building into the system safety valves, including adequate spare capacity across the supply chain.

There is, therefore, a powerful new incentive for the responsible members of the industry to continue working together to help stabilise the market and ensure its steady, orderly evolution in the opening decades of the 21st century, to the benefit of the world community at large. OPEC has long been striving for a constructive, mutually beneficial dialogue and will continue to play its part to the full. We hope others — notably, oil consuming nations and the international oil companies — will also do their share. For it is only if we work together that we can be sure of meeting the supply and capacity challenges successfully.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/335-21-september-2005.html"
"2005-08-30","Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to address you on the subject of “Oil prices: to the sky or stabilisation?”, at the Alfred Berg ABN AMRO’s Nordic Energy Conference. The theme of the conference is “Energy flow in the North”.

My first reaction on seeing a title like “Oil prices: to the sky or stabilisation?” is to reemphasise OPEC’s commitment to stabilisation. After all, this is what OPEC sees as one of its principal objectives in the international oil market. OPEC’s very first Resolution, adopted at its formative Conference in Baghdad in September 1960, states that “Members shall study and formulate a system to ensure the stabilisation of prices.” This was revised slightly and formalised in the OPEC Statute during the following year, and since then has provided one of the main guiding principles for all our actions. (Slide 2) Article 2B of the Statute reads: “The Organization shall devise ways and means of ensuring the stabilisation of prices in international oil markets, with a view to eliminating harmful and unnecessary fluctuations.”

But there is more to it than that. What price levels are consistent — or compatible — with stabilisation? The time dimension also enters the picture, as there is the recognition of the fact that the international oil market is constantly evolving, with continually shifting fundamentals. For most of the time, such changes are barely detectable. But, as we have seen over the past 15 months or so, they can be very apparent — or, at least, the possibility that there has been a significant shift in fundamentals can be very apparent. [This is because, even now, in this most recent case, it is not totally clear whether there has been a significant shift in market fundamentals, let alone the true nature and extent of such an occurrence.] There is also the fact that, in the final analysis, the oil market is prone to volatility — as has been demonstrated repeatedly in the past, as well as at the present time. This is the exact opposite of what is required from a commodity that has such a central role to play in the modern world.

Let us look at Article 2C of the OPEC Statute to help define some of the parameters that OPEC considers as appropriate for stabilisation: “Due regard shall be given at all times to the interests of the producing nations and to the necessity of securing: a steady income to the producing countries; an efficient, regular and economic supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry.” [There is also another important parameter and that is the assurance of steady, predictable demand; this is often overlooked by consumers, but, for producers, is as important and as fundamental as security of supply, especially when one is weighing-up investment options for the future. Security of demand goes hand-in-hand with security of supply.]

Let us now turn to the other half of the title of this address: “Oil prices: to the sky …?” This prompts us to ask: “How high is the sky?” We also find ourselves engaging in the issue of real and nominal prices (I shall elaborate upon this a little later). (Slide 3) Some people with long memories will recall that, at the beginning of the 1980s, some analysts were predicting crude oil prices, in nominal terms, of US $100 a barrel by the year 2000! In fact, our records show that the nominal price of OPEC’s Reference Basket was not even a quarter of that — $23.89/b — on 31 December 1999! Even now, in these highly unusual times, the Basket price penetrated the $50/b mark for the first time ever in only March this year.

OPEC, like all producers, does not want excessive oil prices in either direction, high or low. Nor does it want volatility. We remember how, after the high prices and volatility of the 1970s, there was a big switch away from oil, especially OPEC oil, in the first half of the 1980s, so much so that prices weakened at first and then collapsed in 1986. In July of that year, the price of OPEC’s Reference Basket — projected back, because this reference yardstick was introduced in January 1987 — fell well below $9/b, and this compared with an annual average of $32.4 in 1982. In a period of just six years — from 1979 to 1985 — OPEC crude oil production declined by more than half, and only now is it approaching its pre-1980 levels — after a quarter of a century. The big loss of production, coupled to the price collapse, struck a double blow to OPEC’s Member Countries, whose domestic economies had become heavily dependant on the receipt of steady, viable petroleum revenues to finance their much-needed economic and social development programmes.

There are other downsides to excessively high oil prices — in the context of the international oil market. (Slides 4 and 5) Notably, these can distort the distribution of returns from oil sales, with, in many countries, particularly in Europe, consumer governments benefiting the most, through the receipt of higher levels of extra revenue, from taxation, than either the producers or the refiners receive. It is interesting to note that, averaged across the last five-year period (2000–04), the oil tax revenues of the G-7 countries were significantly higher than OPEC’s oil export revenues. Indeed, only in 2004 was there a change in the situation, in the wake of the high oil prices, but this was only to a slight degree and because, for that year, tax revenues grew by less than export revenues. (Slide 6) But the international oil companies (IOCs) stand to benefit the most. Last year, the five largest IOCs saw their revenue increase by more than $250 billion.

I should now like to tie all of this in with what is actually happening in the oil market at the present time.

(Slide 7) Over the past year or so, we have seen how quickly volatility and steeply rising prices can occur, following an extended period of relative stability — even when the market is well-supplied with crude. An unusual convergence of factors has been responsible for this.

(Slide 8) First, there has been strong global economic growth and a consequent big rise in the demand for oil, (Slides 9 and 10) especially in China, and, globally, this has led to concern about the near-term availability of spare production capacity. This is in spite of the fact that, throughout, the market has remained well-supplied with crude. (Slide 11) While the higher and apparently sustainable economic growth has no doubt contributed to some extent to the price levels we are seeing today, what is of more significance is the recognition that serious problems downstream in key consuming regions are increasingly putting pressure on crude prices. These problems have been due, in great part, to inadequate past investment and increasingly stringent product specifications, and have resulted in a lack of effective global refining capacity to meet the growth in demand for light products; this is now running at close to 100 per cent in practically all regions. Adding to the market nervousness have been the geopolitical tensions in some producing areas, as well as unexpected weather patterns, most notably Hurricane Katrina at the present time. Overall, the resultant bullish state of the market has led to a rise in activity by non-commercials, in particular pension and index funds in futures markets, leading, in turn, to further volatility and higher price levels.

Clearly, there are no winners from such a situation. It can have an adverse effect on activities at all levels within the market and, ultimately, have negative repercussions for both producers and consumers. (Slides 12–14) Volatility can be highly detrimental to investment, either for domestic development or in future production capacity — in addition to the day-to-day workings of the market-place. If prices are so high that they cannot be sustained, they may well be followed by very low prices and reduced revenues not long afterwards.

(Slide 15) Of course, “high” is a relative term. Although prices have recently been at record-breaking levels in nominal terms, if we put them in their proper historical context, we will find that, in real terms, they are well below those witnessed two decades ago. [In other words, when we adjust for inflation and exchange rate movements, we find that the average nominal price of around $36/b for the OPEC Reference Basket last year would, in real terms, correspond to a price of $80/b in 1982. In addition, one must be aware of the fact that the world, especially the developed part, has become much wealthier since the early 1980s.]

Moreover, there is no evidence that the recent high oil prices have, so far, had a significant impact on economic growth, which continues to be robust. If there is one lesson we have learned from the exceptional oil market conditions of 2004, it is that the world economy has become less sensitive to oil price increases than it was three decades ago. Indeed, despite another 50 per cent rise in oil prices so far this year, there has been no visible impact on economic growth. If anything, it is economic growth that has been driving up oil prices, rather than the other way round.

Important here is oil intensity — the amount of oil required for a unit of GDP. Across the world at large, this has fallen by around 50 per cent since 1970, due to such factors as technology, government policies and changing consumer behaviour. Thus the world is less dependant on oil for its economic growth. There is, however, no room for complacency.

In response to the present volatility and high prices, OPEC has acted on two broad fronts. (Slide 16) First, it has raised its production ceiling on several occasions, by a total of 4.5 million barrels a day, and this has been reflected in actual rises in its production. (Slide 17) This has, in turn, led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks, which are exceeding their five-year average, in both absolute terms in days of forward cover. And secondly, OPEC’s Member Countries have accelerated their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity. These actions have been taken, in spite of the fact that the market — a pretty nervous market — has been well-supplied with oil throughout this period. In fact, without such prompt OPEC actions, it is hard to imagine where the market would be today.

Our latest projections show that the average level of world oil demand will rise by 1.6 mb/d to 83.6 mb/d in 2005, compared with 2004, and then by another 1.6 mb/d in 2006. (Slide 18) But, unlike in the 1980s, the 1990s and the early part of this century, non-OPEC supply will not rise in line with this; instead, it is projected to grow by only 0.9 per cent in 2005 and 1.3 mb/d in 2006. Indeed, for the third year in a row, the growth in non-OPEC supply is falling behind that of world oil demand, and this new trend is expected to continue at least into next year. (Slides 19 and 20) Russian supply growth has almost vanished.

(Slide 21) Average OPEC production capacity is now expected to rise to 32.7 mb/d this year, and this will be well above the 28.9 mb/d call on OPEC.

Early forecasts for 2006 see world oil demand rising by another 1.6 mb/d to 85.2 mb/d and non-OPEC supply growing by a slightly lower 1.3 mb/d to 56.0 mb/d. This will leave a difference of 29.2 mb/d, which is 300,000 b/d above that of 2005. However, average OPEC production capacity is expected to rise to 33.9 mb/d in 2006. As a result, average OPEC spare capacity for the year should stand at around ten per cent, which will reflect favourable historical proportions and compares with around eight per cent expected for 2005 and 6.6 per cent in 2004.

Furthermore, OPEC has accelerated plans to increase crude production capacity to meet the expected growth in demand further in the future, with production capacity growing by 3.5–4.0 mb/d between 2006 and 2010, in addition to gains of 1.5 mb/d in the production of OPEC natural gas liquids and other liquids (Slide 22). Therefore, we are confident that, through OPEC’s actions, there will be enough crude in the market to meet robust oil demand growth in the near future.

(Slide 23) However, the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC producers to increase capacity upstream stand in sharp contrast to developments in world refinery capacity, where increases have lagged well behind demand growth and the rises in OPEC and non-OPEC crude supply. Corresponding efforts need to materialise downstream, where, in some regions, refiners are currently running at 98 per cent or close to full capacity. OPEC Member Countries have taken the initiative — on their own and in partnership with others — to pursue and invest in downstream projects. However, without meaningful and timely measures in the main consuming countries, the high and volatile oil prices noted in the recent Group of Eight communiqué are likely to remain a feature of the market.

[It is clear from everything I have said so far that OPEC and its Member Countries are totally committed to an orderly oil market, with stable prices that are at reasonable levels acceptable to producers and consumers alike. Indeed, if there were not such acceptability, then the market would not remain stable for very long.]

[Our experience has shown us that it is considered perfectly acceptable within the market at large to talk in terms of a target range for prices. The price band scheme OPEC introduced in the year 2000 ran very successfully until last year, when the exceptional market conditions shifted the goalposts, so to speak, so far that we decided to suspend it, for re-evaluation. For those of you who do not know, the purpose of the price band was to keep oil prices within a range of $22–28/b for the Reference Basket, through OPEC adjusting its production level whenever it looked as if prices were settling outside this range. The scheme worked so well that, across the three full years of its operation, 2001–03, the Basket price average $25.2/b, which was almost exactly at the centre of the band. But let me stress that the band has only been suspended and that it is planned to reintroduce it, with a new, carefully calculated and realistic range, when the market settles down again.]

Let me now say a few words about the future, because OPEC is as committed to market stability in five, ten or 15 years’ time as it is today. Indeed, decisions taken today will affect the way the market performs in the future.

(Slide 24) The reference case scenario from OPEC’s World Energy Model shows that global oil demand will continue to rise up to 2025, at an annual average rate of 1.5 per cent, to 111 million barrels a day. More than three-quarters of the increase will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. This scenario is based on the assumption of an average annual world economic growth rate of 3.5 per cent for the period up to 2025, with the forecast rate of almost 5.0 per cent for the developing countries being double the OECD’s projected 2.4 per cent.

(Slide 25) There should, however, be plenty of oil around to meet this demand. (Slides 26 and 27) The world’s oil resource base is not a constraint, and this is not likely to become even an issue for decades to come.

Overall non-OPEC output will continue to increase, but more slowly, reaching a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period; this represents a rise of 5–7 mb/d from 2004.

However, OPEC’s Member Countries, with around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, have both the capability and the will to continue expanding their oil production capacity to meet the rising levels of demand. Averaged out, a dollar of investment in the OPEC area yields more than four times as much production capacity as a dollar of investment elsewhere. In 2025, the reference case, therefore, sees OPEC meeting almost half the world’s oil demand, with 55 mb/d.

The overall scale of investment required for all of this will run into hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming decades, although, globally, it will not be very different to past levels.

(Slide 28) Numerous possibilities for investment exist, although recently a move towards more involvement from the international oil companies in the upstream activities of some OPEC Member Countries has been observed. However, other Members might choose to meet the investment challenge through their national oil companies, or they could do it in partnership with the IOCs. Of prime importance will be the establishment of fair and workable agreements, reached through open and transparent procedures. There will have to be adequate incentives for the investor, yet suitable protection and recompense for the owner of the resource. And there will have to be a clear commitment to sustainable long-term development by the IOCs in setting up partnerships.

(Slide 29) But clouding the picture for investment are many uncertainties about the market outlook, on both the demand and supply sides. Notable drivers of uncertainty are future economic growth rates, consumer government policies, technological advances and the oil price path. It can prove very costly if the industry does not get its sums right. Over-investment may result in excessive, idle capacity, while under-investment may lead to a crude shortage. Both cases can create severe price volatility.

(Slide 30) Increasingly, attention is being turned increasingly to investment in the downstream, in the same way as we are placing more focus on this part of the supply chain for the near term. The move towards demand for ever lighter and cleaner products represents a significant challenge for the downstream sector, and substantial investment will be required to meet this in the years ahead. As with the shorter term, if the required investment does not take place in a timely manner, this sector will remain a source of volatility and tightness. (Slide 31) As it stands now, it does not appear that the growth in refinery capacity will match demand growth before 2007.

Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

I hope I have used this time well to impress upon you how seriously OPEC takes the issue of order and stability in the international oil market, for both now and the future.

Speaking to an audience which contains His Excellency Mr Per Kristian Foss, the Norwegian Minister of Finance, and key executives from the Nordic energy industry and associated sectors, I am sure this message has been well understood and appreciated. As the world’s third-largest oil-exporter, and the largest among the established market economies, Norway is better placed than most to appreciate the challenges facing the industry as a whole. On top of this, the country is also the world’s third-largest gas-exporter.

Over the years, OPEC has placed great value on the support its market-stabilisation measures have received from Norway, particularly at critical times for the industry, and this has been to our mutual benefit. (Slide 32) We also welcome the fact that Norway — like OPEC itself — has been a prime mover in producer-consumer dialogue. Indeed, Norway has provided the first Secretary General of the International Energy Forum, Mr Arne Walther, and the Secretariat of this still relatively new specialist producer-consumer institution has been set up in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia.

We believe that such common areas of interest, attitudes and actions have already served the industry well, and that they will continue to do so in the future.

(Slide 33) Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/336-30-august-2005.html"
"2005-07-08","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers of the Aspen Dialogue on World Economy for inviting me to join this illustrious panel, whose theme is “Energy: the coming back of the Gulf”. This subject is of much interest to the world energy community at the present time, and the topics for discussion focus on some of the areas that are likely to have a major influence on the evolution of the industry in the months and years ahead.

Some people believe that we may now be witnessing fundamental changes across the world energy landscape, and, if this is indeed the case, then this could have a significant impact on the Transatlantic economy.

How do we, in OPEC, view the situation? Let us look at developments in the leading energy sector, oil, over the past year or so, because the oil sector is generally seen as being, so to speak, the pace-maker for the rest of the industry. In doing so, we see the following.

Prices rise dramatically, even though the market remains well-supplied with oil. Downstream bottlenecks put pressure on upstream prices, particularly in the United States of America, where refining margins are large. There has been a fulcrum shift in energy demand towards Asia — especially China and, to a lesser extent so far, India — and we are talking about very large volumes here. Non-OPEC producers are having difficulty in keeping up with incremental demand — for the third year running, the growth in non-OPEC supply is falling behind that of world oil demand, and this new trend is expected to continue at least into 2006; Russian supply growth has almost vanished. The market is less responsive to OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures, however rigorously such measures have been conceived and applied. And there has been an unusually heavy influence of market psychology — at one stage in 2004, some analysts believed that speculation might be responsible for a premium on a barrel of crude of between US $5 and $15.

On the other hand, certain realities remain unchanged. In the final analysis and with the appropriate passage of time, the international oil market is still subject to the fundamentals of supply and demand, while experiencing cyclical movements in the short term.

In reality, it is difficult to know the true extent to which the market is experiencing fundamental change at the present time. The jury is still out. Perhaps we shall have to wait another five or ten years to find the answer, to a time when we will be able to view the situation with the benefit of hindsight.

However, there is one other outstanding point that should be made here.

Although prices have recently been at record-breaking levels in nominal terms, if we put them in their proper historical context, we will find that, in real terms, they are well below those witnessed two decades ago. In other words, if the OPEC Reference Basket-equivalent price in 1982 were adjusted for subsequent changes in inflation and exchange rates, it would have been $80/b in 2004, more than double the actual average for last year of $36/b. In addition, one must be aware of the fact that the world, especially the developed part, has become much wealthier since the early 1980s.

Moreover, there is no evidence that the recent high oil prices have, so far, had a significant impact on economic growth, which continues to be robust. If there is one lesson we have learned from the exceptional oil market conditions of 2004, it is that the world economy has become less sensitive to oil price increases than it was three decades ago.

Important here is oil intensity — the amount of oil required for a unit of GDP. Across the world at large, this has fallen by around 50 per cent since 1970, due to such factors as technology, government policies and changing consumer behaviour. Thus the world is less dependant on oil for its economic growth.

However, continued rapid oil price rises are clearly not desirable for any responsible party. In addition to the more obvious economic downsides, they can distort the distribution of returns from oil sales, with, in many countries, particularly in Europe, consumer governments benefiting the most, through the receipt of higher levels of extra revenue, from taxation, than either the producers or the refiners receive.

In the light of the present market uncertainty and demand pressures, the spotlight has been turned upon OPEC increasingly, and the Organization has responded on two fronts. First, it has raised its production ceiling on several occasions, by a total of 4.5 million barrels a day; this has, in turn, led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks, which are exceeding their five-year average, in both absolute terms and in days of forward cover. And, secondly, its Member Countries have accelerated their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity. These actions have been taken, in spite of the fact that the market — a pretty nervous market — has been well-supplied with oil throughout this period.

We are confident that, through OPEC’s actions, there will be enough crude in the market to meet robust oil demand growth in the near future. However, while OPEC’s spare capacity growth has been in line with the strong demand growth, this has not been the case downstream, where it has fallen behind. Perhaps it is time that more attention is paid to the downstream part of the supply-chain, in the interests of overall market stability. This is a responsibility that should be shared by all stakeholders in the oil market: consumers, producers and international oil companies. It offers challenges and opportunities to our Member Countries.

We have the same confidence when we look further into the future. Indeed, the world can rest assured that there should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. The world’s oil resource base is not a constraint, with regard to meeting future demand. Not only are we talking about conventional oil, but there is also unconventional oil, such as tar sands, oil shale and gas-to-liquids. Moreover, there is potential for making new discoveries, as well as increasing recovery from existing fields.

Using OPEC’s World Energy Model, our reference case scenario shows a continued rise in global oil demand up to 2025, by a total of 28 million a day to 111 mb/d — an annual average growth rate of 1.5 per cent, according to these projections.

OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of world oil demand. However, more than three-quarters of the increase in demand over the next 20 years will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth. The transportation sector will account for almost 60 per cent of the rise in global demand over the next two decades.

Our projections show that there will be a slight swing towards oil and gas by 2025, to around two-thirds of the world primary energy mix. Separately, oil’s share will dip slightly to 37 per cent, while that of gas will increase significantly to 30 per cent.

Overall non-OPEC output will continue to increase, but more slowly, reaching a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period; this represents a rise of 5–7 mb/d from 2004.

However, OPEC’s Member Countries, with around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, have both the capability and the will to continue expanding their oil production capacity to meet the rising levels of demand. In 2025, the reference case therefore sees OPEC meeting almost half the world’s oil demand, with 55 mb/d.

Clearly, dependence upon the Gulf will rise. For statistical purposes, we refer to the “Gulf” as the “Middle East”, which roughly covers the same, non-Africa area.

Since the early 1990s, the Middle East’s share of world crude oil production has fluctuated within an annual average range of around 29–33 per cent. But this share looks set to rise now, even more than OPEC’s share as a whole.

With gas, on the other hand, there has been a steady increase in the Middle East’s share of world marketed natural gas production throughout this period, rising from 5.1 per cent in 1990 to 9.6 per cent in 2003. This trend — which stretches back, almost unbroken, at least as far as OPEC’s establishment in 1960, when the share was just 0.6 per cent — is expected to continue in the future, as gas, generally, increases its share of the world energy mix.

Thus, taking oil and gas together, the world is expected to receive increasing amounts of its primary energy from the Middle East in the first quarter of this century, if current trends continue.

What does all of this mean for the consumer? To answer this, let us return to a broader OPEC perspective, bearing in mind the fact that the oil pricing and production policies of Middle East producers are heavily influenced by OPEC decisions.

OPEC is committed to achieving order and stability in the international oil market, with supply and demand that are steady and secure, and prices for consumers, revenues for producers and returns to investors that are fair and reasonable. Its actions in the market are centred around this commitment.

Market order and stability serve the best interests of OPEC’s Member Countries. Their economic fortunes are heavily dependant upon their oil revenue, which collectively accounts for around two-thirds of their total export revenue. Crude oil is a finite resource and these countries must do all they can to diversify their economies and develop the appropriate supporting infrastructure, while they have commercially viable reserves of crude, so that they can sustain the economic momentum generated by the receipt of these revenues and continue to prosper. Even though reliance on oil is expected to slowly decrease in the future, the reliance on OPEC oil is bound to rise. Thus there is every incentive for OPEC producers to do everything they can to ensure order and stability in the market.

But this is by no means a straightforward task, as witnessed by the difficulties of the past year, when many factors, that are beyond OPEC’s control, have had such a destabilising influence on the price level. Also, with regard to the future —which also features very much in OPEC’s calculations — there are vast uncertainties which make sound investment planning a hazardous business, in an industry where the lead times for new plant and equipment can be very long and the capital requirements enormous. Future economic growth rates, consumer government policies and technologies advances lie at the heart of these uncertainties. Over-investment implies heavy costs to be borne by producers, while under-investment will lead to severe price volatility.

Thus every effort must be made to reduce uncertainties and to share the risks involved. Dialogue and cooperation have a big role to play in this, and we welcome the big advances that have been made in these areas in recent years. Indeed, OPEC has been in the forefront of this for the past couple of decades, as part of its concerted efforts to promote a better understanding between producers and consumers, as well as among producers. Meetings such as this play an important part in the process, by enabling people to discuss issues of topical interest, exchange ideas and forge a common understanding of the challenges ahead for the oil industry. There is also a growing number of institutionalised fora aimed at enhancing cooperation and dialogue and these are appearing in the key energy centres across the world. The most recent of these is the European Union-OPEC Energy Dialogue, which had its first meeting in Brussels last month. Before that, OPEC was instrumental in setting up the specialist producer-consumer dialogue body, the International Energy Forum, which now has its Secretariat in one of our Member Countries, Saudi Arabia.

Whether or not the oil industry is now experiencing a process of fundamental change, we nevertheless wish to assure you that, for OPEC’s part, it is well-equipped to meet the challenges of both the present and the future. However, as I have just said, dialogue and cooperation will have an important role to play in this, as will the minimising of uncertainties. The fact that world oil supply is expected to be concentrated increasingly in the OPEC area — and, in particular, in the Middle East — means that consumers will continue to benefit from a vast resource base, an established infrastructure and an unwavering commitment to market order and stability.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/337-8-july-2005.html"
"2005-07-05","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by saying how honored I am to be invited to address this energy dinner debate on the subject of the global oil outlook: challenges and opportunities for OPEC, here in Strasbourg tonight. The purpose of the European Energy Forum, in encouraging dialogue and the exchange of information among members of the energy community, is particularly appropriate at the present time, when there is an unusually high degree of uncertainty in the market and when timely and effective action is required by all parties to moderate the situation.

As many of you know, just one month ago, the first meeting of the newly established EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue was held in Brussels. This provided us with the opportunity to examine how the oil market challenges are viewed from the perspectives of our two organisations, and seek means of addressing them.

(Slide 2) The EU-OPEC Energy Dialogue is a natural extension of the warm relations that have existed for decades in many areas of activity involving Members of the two groups. The EU is OPEC’s main trading partner and accounts for an increasing share of our Organization’s total trade. We want to build upon this.

At the same time, there are some areas — some key areas — where a closer examination of topical issues is required, and this is where we expect the new dialogue to come into its element. Energy security issues are a case in point, where producer concerns about steady predictable outlets for their crude must be addressed with the same vigour as consumer concerns about security of supply. Energy and environmental policies, that unwittingly can have profound impacts on demand and on investments in the upstream and downstream, are another example. These and other important matters, such as collaboration in energy/oil technology and research, will feature prominently in the dialogue.

(Slide 3) OPEC welcomed the success of that first meeting. Of particular significance were the importance each side attaches to order and stability in the oil market, both now and in the future, as well as the linkages between a viable, sustainable oil sector and other broader considerations, such as economic development, social progress and the protection of the environment. Both sides are now engaged in developing the dialogue further, to make it a practical and effective process in the years ahead and an important addition to producer-consumer relations across the world at large.

Today’s dinner-debate provides us with another opportunity to share with you our assessment of the current oil market.

(Slide 4) Over the past year or so, we have seen how quickly volatility and steeply rising prices can occur, following an extended period of relative stability — even when the market is well-supplied with crude and in spite of OPEC’s measures, aimed at achieving order and stability. These have ensured, in a decisive and transparent manner, that supply growth remains above demand growth, with OECD commercial oil stocks climbing to higher levels than in the past five years.

An unusual convergence of factors has been responsible for the past year’s high prices and volatility. (Slide 5) First of all, there has been strong global economic growth and a consequent big rise in the demand for oil, especially in China, and, globally, this has led to concern about the near-term availability of spare production capacity. (Slide 6) Increasingly, however, analysts are recognising that there are serious problems downstream in key consuming regions and that these are themselves putting pressure on crude prices. These problems have been due, in great part, to inadequate past investment and increasingly stringent product specifications, and have resulted in a lack of effective global refining capacity; this is now running at close to 100 per cent in practically all regions. (Slide 7) In particular, there has been concern about possible shortages of middle distillates, in the face of the strong demand; for example, in the United States of America, distillate demand growth is again at five per cent. Adding to the market nervousness have been the geopolitical tensions in some producing areas. (Slide 8) Overall, the resultant bullish bias has led to a rise in activity by non-commercials, in particular pension and index funds in futures markets, leading, in turn, to further volatility, as well as contributing to the upward price spirals.

As we all know, there are no winners from such a situation. Volatility and high prices can have an adverse effect on activities at all levels within the market and, ultimately, have negative repercussions for both producers and consumers. Volatility can be highly detrimental to investment, either for domestic development or in future production capacity — in addition to the day-to-day workings of the market-place. If prices are so high that they cannot be sustained, they may well be followed by very low prices and reduced revenues not long afterwards.

(Slide 9) Of course, “high” is a relative term. We should remember that, although oil prices have recently reached record levels, their real value is well below historical peaks, and certainly leads to a more moderate interpretation of recent price behaviour. Also, the fall in the value of the US dollar has had an impact upon oil prices in different world regions, as well as affecting the purchasing power of every barrel sold. Furthermore, landed prices of crude paid by consumers, as well as prices that apply to exporters, are often well below benchmark levels.

(Slide 10) Indeed, analysts are asking whether there has been a structural shift in oil prices, particularly in the light of the current price strength of West Texas Intermediate, in nominal terms. Early impressions are that this may, indeed, be the case.

Let us recall that it was not so long ago that the price volatility was in the opposite direction, with prices dropping below $10 a barrel in the winter of 1998/99, brought on by the Asian financial crisis. This experience underlined the requirement for market stability and the need for measures to support this. Of course, those low prices had a big impact on the revenues available for investment in the industry and were simply unsustainable. We are still witnessing the impact of this, in terms of investment that never materialised, particularly in the downstream.

All of this explains why OPEC is committed to the achievement of order and stability in the international oil market at all times, with supply and demand that are steady and secure, and prices for consumers, revenues for producers and returns to investors that are fair and reasonable. Such principles are enshrined in the OPEC Statute, whose origins date back to 1961. Increasingly, people are recognising the wisdom behind them, because they have come to realise that, in the final analysis, the oil market is prone to volatility — as has been demonstrated repeatedly in the past and was particularly apparent in 2004 and on into 2005. This is the exact opposite of what is required from a commodity that has such a central role to play in the modern world.

(Slide 11) Of particular significance at the present time — in the light of the volatility of the past year — is the fact that OPEC’s spare capacity, from which the market has benefited for so long, provides a situation upstream that is in stark contrast to that downstream. While OPEC’s spare capacity growth has been in line with the strong demand growth, this has not been the case downstream, where it has fallen behind. It is time that more attention is paid to the downstream part of the supply-chain, in the interests of overall market stability. This is a responsibility that should be shared with consumers. It also offers opportunities to our Member Countries.

(Slide 12) Our latest projections show that the average level of world oil demand will rise by 1.8 mb/d to 83.9 mb/d in 2005, compared with 2004, (Slide 13) and that much of this will be met by increases in non-OPEC supply, which is projected to grow by 1.1 mb/d. (Slide 14) However, for the third year in a row, the growth in non-OPEC supply is falling behind that of world oil demand, and this new trend is expected to continue at least into next year. Russian supply growth, which used to account for the biggest part of non-OPEC growth, has almost vanished.

(Slide 15) In response to all of this, OPEC has acted on two broad fronts. First, it has raised its production ceiling on several occasions, by a total of 4.5 million barrels a day. (Slide 16) This has, furthermore, as mentioned earlier, led to a steady rise in OECD commercial oil stocks, which are exceeding their five-year average, in both absolute terms and in days of forward cover. And secondly, OPEC’s Member Countries have sought to accelerate their plans to bring on-stream new production capacity.

(Slides 17 and 18) Average OPEC production capacity is now expected to rise to 32.7 mb/d, and this will be well above the 29.2 mb/d which, in these projections, is seen as the difference between world demand and non-OPEC supply. The bulk of this is expected to be ready by the second half of 2005, and it includes a range of light, medium and heavy crudes. Peering a bit further ahead, OPEC is committed to expanding capacity above this level, and present expectations are for the addition of another 3.5–4.0 mb/d between 2006 and 2010.

Therefore, we are confident that the market will continue to be well-supplied with crude throughout this year — and, for that matter, in the coming year — to support the robust economic growth that is expected during that period in both the developed and developing worlds.

(Slide 19) Turning to the long term, the latest reference case from the OPEC World Energy Model has projections based on an average annual world economic growth rate of 3.5 per cent for the period up to 2025. The forecast rate of almost 5.0 per cent for the developing countries will be double the OECD’s projected 2.4 per cent.

Global oil demand will rise by 28 million barrels a day to 111 mb/d by 2025 — an annual average growth rate of 1.5 per cent. OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of world oil demand. (Slide 20) However, more than three-quarters of the increase in demand over the next 20 years will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth. The transportation sector will account for almost 60 per cent of the rise in global demand over the next two decades.

(Slide 21) Turning to supply, let me start by saying that the world can rest assured that there should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. The world’s oil resource base is not a constraint, with regard to meeting future demand. Not only are we talking about conventional oil, where there is vast potential for making new discoveries, as well as increasing recovery from existing field, (Slide 22) but there is also unconventional oil, such as tar sands and gas-to-liquids.

(Slide 23) Our reference case projections for the period up to 2025 show that overall non-OPEC output will continue to increase, but more slowly, reaching a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. This represents a rise of 5–7 mb/d from 2004, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty.

(Slide 24) If the projected world demand materialises, OPEC’s Member Countries, with around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, have both the capability and the will to continue expanding their oil production capacity to meet it. In 2025, the reference case therefore sees OPEC meeting almost half the world’s oil demand, with 55 mb/d.

The overall scale of investment required for all of this will run into many billions of dollars in the coming decades, although, globally, it will not be very different to past levels. Moreover, averaged out, a dollar of investment in the OPEC area yields more than four times as much production capacity as a dollar of investment elsewhere.

In order for oil producers to meet the growing demand for oil in the most efficient and effective manner, they require the latest technology in a form that is economically viable and ready for commercial application. This is particularly important in today’s world, where oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before, to conform to rising consumer expectations, as well as an increasing amount of legislation and regulations. In recent decades, at an accelerating pace, application of the latest technology has helped expand the sources of oil supply, reduce costs, improve oil-use efficiency and satisfy beneficial environmental requirements, such as capturing CO2 for enhanced oil recovery — a technology that is of particular interest to OPEC and that is ideal for international win-win cooperation.

(Slide 25) Numerous possibilities for investment exist, although recently a move towards more involvement from the international oil companies in the upstream activities of some OPEC Member Countries has been observed. However, other Members might choose to meet the investment challenge through their national oil companies, or they could do it in partnership with the IOCs.

Of prime importance will be the establishment of fair and workable agreements, reached through open and transparent procedures. There will have to be adequate incentives for the investor, yet suitable protection and recompense for the owner of the resource. And there will have to be a clear commitment to sustainable long-term development by the IOCs in setting up partnerships. Every contractual legal framework and fiscal system will have its various implications on oil production policy.

The issue is extremely complex and has many dimensions. It will, therefore, be up to each OPEC Member Country to strike the right balance in whichever system they apply.

(Slide 26) Adding to the complexities surrounding investment are many uncertainties about the market outlook, on both the demand and supply sides. Notable drivers of uncertainty are future economic growth rates, consumer government policies and technological advances. Uncertainty can be a matter of great significance when we try to crystallise our investment plans. (Slide 27) If we assume economic growth to be just one percentage point lower than in the reference case, already by 2010 an estimated uncertainty of $25 billion for required OPEC investment will have emerged — and this could reach $150 bn by 2025. It can prove very costly if the industry does not get its sums right. Over-investment may result in excessive, idle capacity, while under-investment may lead to a crude shortage. Both cases can create severe price volatility.

(Slides 28 and 29) Noting that the average crude slate is unlikely to change much over the coming years, attention is being turned increasingly to investment in the downstream. No greater case could be made for this than the volatility and rising prices experienced in the oil market over the past 12 months.

A key element in this picture is how the oil product demand structure will change. The move towards demand for ever lighter and cleaner products represents a significant challenge for the downstream sector, and substantial investment will be required to meet this in the years ahead. Again, too little capacity results in refining bottlenecks, which are very much apparent today, while too much can lead to costly plants being mothballed. If the required investment does not take place in a timely manner, this sector will remain a source of volatility and tightness.

In financial terms, Asia is still expected to be the dominant region, in terms of downstream investment requirements. However, the requirements elsewhere are also substantial, because of the large expenditure implied by the need to move towards cleaner products. Also, as with the upstream, uncertainties can impede the process of determining investment strategies in the downstream.

Thus every effort must be made to reduce uncertainties. Dialogue and cooperation have a big role to play in this. But it is also important that the energy policies in consumer countries are stable and transparent, and are in harmony with the overall needs of the market.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

(Slide 30) It is clear from my remarks today that OPEC will continue to be a very active player in the international oil market well into the 21st century, with the aim of bringing steady, secure and timely supplies of crude to consumers, at reasonable prices. But to be truly effective in this requires wide support from many other parties — producers and consumers, as well as the international oil companies, financial institutions and other influential and supporting bodies, such as legislative bodies, like the EU Parliament here in Strasbourg.

That is why we welcome so much the new enhanced level of dialogue between the EU and OPEC. It plays a valuable role in furthering the global process of producer-consumer dialogue. And, at the same time, it opens up exciting new possibilities with regard to economic activities among members of the two intergovernmental bodies, not just in energy, but also in many other fields.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/338-5-july-2005.html"
"2005-04-18","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for the invitation to deliver this keynote address to the 9th Economist Government Roundtable.

When we address the theme of the Roundtable — “Envisaging a stronger Europe through its leaders” — it is clear that an essential condition for a stronger — and larger — Europe is a secure, efficient and effective energy system. We are, of course, at the present time witnessing a period of extensive change in the European Union, in the wake of its recent enlargement, and this in itself must be fully accommodated within the energy system, over and above the other developments which have been taking place across the region in recent years.

At the same time, in the minds of some, the recent high oil prices and volatility have focused attention on broader issues of energy security — and such concern has been heightened by the fact that the recent oil price volatility followed a period of relatively high stability, thanks in part to the successful introduction and use of OPEC’s price band concept in 2000–03. This raises the following interesting question: Have we now entered a new era, characterised by much higher prices than in the past?

In such a situation, it is inevitable that thoughts will turn to basic issues and that these will revolve around the acquisition of secure supplies of energy at reasonable prices. In some quarters, this is seen as a battle for energy dominance, which was, in fact, the proposed theme of this address. Envisaged is a future where there is vigorous competition for depleting energy resources around the world, particularly oil and gas. Such anxiety is expressed in the particular context of the huge surge in demand which is being witnessed in key parts of the world at the present time, particularly Asia and most notably China and India, with their huge populations and vast potentials for economic growth. In order to emphasise the true potential of all this for future demand, it is significant to note that they are currently consuming but a fraction of the energy per capita consumed by even the advanced developing countries.

However, we proposed the change of title to the present, more harmonious one of “Energy for the 21st century: a cooperative approach”, because we recognised that there are viable, alternative means of meeting the forecast robust growth in world energy demand — even when this is coupled with a slowdown in non-OPEC supply — if all the key players in the industry take the required measured actions in an orderly and sustained manner. OPEC, for its part, is committed to doing this.

A significant practical consequence of the past extraordinary year is that it has underlined the difficult job of making reasonably reliable forecasts, even for the short term. After all, who can seriously claim to have predicted the events of 2004 with any reasonable degree of accuracy? And yet the events of that year are already being viewed in some quarters as being of possible landmark significance. Are we truly witnessing changes in longstanding trends? Will, for example, average annual oil demand growth remain above two per cent or revert to the historical average of around 1.5 per cent?

To illustrate the difficulties of forecasting, let’s examine snapshots of the pre- and post-2004 situations. I shall compare the forecasts that appeared in the March 2004 issue of OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report with the early estimates of what happened that appeared in the March 2005 issue, exactly one year later. In the earlier issue, average annual world oil demand was forecast to rise by 1.4 mb/d in 2004, from 2003, compared with the preliminary estimate of 2.6 mb/d which actually occurred last year. In other words, the actual rise in world oil demand was almost double the expectations of one year ago. However, in spite of this, non-OPEC supply, which was forecast, 12 months ago, to rise by 1.6 mb/d, instead actually grew by less than this amount, 1.4 mb/d. To complete the picture, the difference between world oil demand and non-OPEC supply increased by 1.2 mb/d, rather than decreasing by 0.2 mb/d, as had been forecast in March 2004. A similar situation is unfolding for 2005.

Such difficulties with forecasting have reinforced the case for using scenarios in strategic long-term planning. The strategic planning process normally consists of ascertaining a principal objective or set of objectives, identifying key challenges, specifying the fundamental drivers that will shape the scenarios and describing how each scenario will evolve. The idea is to recognise the principal forces that will influence future behaviour, so as to reduce uncertainty and increase knowledge and the ability to influence the turn of events (scenario) through informed policies and measures aimed at achieving the desired objectives and avoiding undesirable paths.

Any number of scenarios, of course, can be constructed to depict possible future outcomes. However, for practical purposes, analysts usually confine themselves to selecting just a handful, so as to provide a sample of the interesting contrasting possibilities.

OPEC has found it helpful at the present time to envisage the energy outlook in the framework of three scenarios, covering the period up to 2025 and based on its World Energy Model, “OWEM”. We have considered two contrasting and feasible scenarios, depicting protracted market tightness (PMT) and a prolonged soft market (PSM), while the third is a central reference case of dynamics as usual (DAU).

The tighter market scenario envisages a future where the oil market is characterised by high sustained oil demand growth, coupled with relatively low non-OPEC supply growth, resulting in increasingly higher demand for OPEC crude and relatively high prices, and requiring more global cooperation across all fronts. Indeed, the oil price is assumed to remain at levels higher than those observed, even in real terms, since the late-1980s. On the other hand, the soft scenario depicts a future where the identified drivers of change are compatible with relatively low growth in oil demand and relatively high non-OPEC supply, resulting in low OPEC supply and prices. However, both these scenarios, in their extreme limits, are inherently prone to instability, and, under certain circumstances, could have serious repercussions, such as boom/bust cycles.

The central reference case scenario envisages a future where the drivers of change shaping the scenario continue their past patterns, and thus no departure from prior trends is expected. Oil demand grows at robust rates, while non-OPEC supply continues to increase, albeit more slowly, to reach a plateau after 2010. The real price of OPEC’s Reference Basket settles at long-term values similar to those observed in past decades.

Interestingly, there are some significant similarities in the features to those formulated by Shell, even though the latter’s set of three scenarios for the same period is constructed in a very different way and is based on the principle of plausible trade-offs between diverse, complex objectives. Shell’s approach to this mirrors very closely our own understanding of the key drivers that need to be noted and accommodated. In particular, Shell’s open doors scenario, where the emphasis is placed on strong, synchronised economic growth, efficiency and social cohesion, has broad similarities to OPEC’s tighter market scenario, where a readiness for cooperation and collective responsibility is central.

Over the past year, the market has moved in the direction of OPEC’s protracted market tightness scenario. However, we are still some distance from the alarming extreme variants of this scenario, which could lead to an eventual collapse into the soft market scenario, where a “battle for energy dominance” could be foreseen. Indeed, the present situation is very manageable, and well-intentioned, responsible collective actions from across the industry can ease the tightness, while maintaining robust global economic growth, in accordance with the more comfortable pattern depicted in our reference case scenario.

Let us now look more closely at the reference case scenario, in the context of OECD Europe. This sees an average annual growth rate of energy demand in OECD Europe of 0.3 per cent in the period up to 2025, which compares with a global rate of 2.0 per cent.

There is little doubt that oil will retain its leading role globally, including in Europe, for the foreseeable future. For practical purposes alone, its combination of qualities still cannot be matched by any other energy source — sufficiency, accessibility, versatility, ease of transport and, in some applications, few alternatives. Advances in technology are making oil a cleaner, safer and more efficient fuel, so that it can meet increasingly tighter environmental regulations, as well as conforming to the broader demands of sustainable development.

While oil demand will continue rising in Europe, its average annual growth rate will be slightly below that of energy as a whole in 2005–25, at 0.2 per cent, and its share of the region’s energy mix will dip from just above 41 per cent to just below it by 2025.

Gas producers share many of the challenges of oil producers — and some OPEC Member Countries are also substantial gas producers. Demand for gas is forecast to rise faster than that of oil, although from a lower base. Average annual growth will be 1.1 per cent and the share of the energy mix will climb from 24 to 28 per cent. This is the source of commercial energy that is most favoured by environmentalists, as well as being a reliable and highly efficient source of power generation. Production costs are coming down too. But the transportation of gas remains expensive, in spite of the big advances that are being made with liquefied natural gas, which are expected to turn it from being a regional to a global fuel. As with oil, there is plenty of gas around.

With regard to the other commercial primary energy sources, solids — principally coal — are forecast to witness a continued decline in demand, which will be reflected in its share of Europe’s energy mix, which will fall by almost three percentage points to 14.5 per cent between now and 2025.

Despite widespread calls within Europe for a diversification of energy sources and a growing use of renewables, benefiting from the imposition of policies to promote this and enjoying wide public support, the reality is that the overall contribution of renewables is expected to remain small during the next 20 years. Even though high — and, in some cases, double-digit — growth is likely, this will be from a very low base, and it will be many decades before renewables make a really significant impact on the energy scene in Europe. There is a similar very long-term profile with regard to notable increases in the use of nuclear and, then, this may come in the form of fusion, to generate electricity and hydrogen for transportation fuel.

Collectively, in the next two decades, while the use of hydro, nuclear and renewables will grow a little in absolute terms, its share of OECD Europe’s energy mix will dip from just above 17 per cent to just below it by 2025, according to our reference case scenario.

Nevertheless, in spite of all this, there will be plenty of time for all of us to make the necessary energy transition in an orderly manner, benefiting to the full from the use of fossil fuels, with due attention to environmental concerns, in particular for developing countries.

I shall now concentrate my remarks on oil, since this is where OPEC’s focus lies and since oil is the leading sector both in quantitative terms and in the eyes of most energy decision-makers, because developments in the oil market have an influence over other energy-carriers.

When we look at oil market projections for OECD Europe for the next two decades, one clear message emerges — the huge and growing difference between oil demand and supply within the region. According to our projections, demand of 15.6 mb/d in 2005 is set against supply of 6.1 mb/d. Over the next 20 years, while demand will continue growing — albeit very slowly — to 16.3 mb/d, supply will fall — and fall heavily — to 3.3 mb/d in 2025. Put another way, while supply now accounts for 39 per cent of demand, in 20 years’ time it will be down to just over half this proportion, 20 per cent. Thus, there will be, inevitably, a greatly increased reliance on outside sources of oil.

The situation, indeed, is much more acute in China and non-OECD Asia. In China, according to our reference case scenario, average annual oil demand will double in the next two decades, from 6.7 mb/d now to 13.4 mb/d in 2025 — but supply will remain the same, at 3.5 mb/d. In Asia, excluding the Middle East, demand will more than double in the same period, from 7.4 to 15.5 mb/d, and supply will actually dip slightly, from 2.5 to 2.4 mb/d.

Let us now look at the situation globally, drawing a distinction between OPEC and non-OPEC supply. Our projections show a strong rise in world oil demand over the next two decades, from 81 mb/d now to 115 mb/d in 2025, but only a small increase in non-OPEC supply in the same period, from 51 to 56 mb/d. Indeed, non-OPEC supply reaches a plateau in around a decade’s time. Again, while non-OPEC accounts for around 63 per cent of world output in 2005, this proportion will dip below 50 per cent 20 years later. Thus the world will come to really much more heavily upon OPEC oil in the future, since its Member Countries hold around four-fifths of prove global crude oil reserves.

However, there should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. It is OPEC’s firm view that the world’s oil resource base is not a constraint, with regard to meeting future demand. If we look at cumulative production, as a percentage of the estimated resource base, over the past four decades, we see that it has been relatively stable, and this is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future. Over and above the world’s proven crude oil reserves, there is still plenty of oil that has yet to be discovered, in regions whose geological structures suggest a high probability of commercially viable reserves. This is particularly true for OPEC areas.

In contrast, while the international oil companies were reporting, up to not-so-long ago, that they were able to add to new reserves in non-OPEC areas at a greater rate than the depletion of existing ones, this no longer appears to be the case.

Also, it must be remembered that the current share of crude oil in total oil supply is around 84 per cent, with the rest consisting mainly of synthetic crudes, processing gains and such non-crudes as natural gas liquids. However, over the next ten years, in spite of the continuing forward march of technology, no dramatic change is expected.

OPEC’s Member Countries will, therefore, need to expand their oil production capacity to meet the extra demand for crude. The scale of investment required for this will run into many billions of dollars in the coming decades, although, globally, it will not be very different to past investment. However, investment in OPEC areas yields more than a fourfold multiple, in terms of production capacity, compared with the same level of investment in non-OPEC areas.

Nevertheless, the exact magnitude is subject to large uncertainties, in the shape of, for example, future economic growth rates, consumer government policies and technological advances. To explain the significance of this, let me point out that, if economic growth turns out to be just one per cent lower than what is assumed in our reference case, already by 2010 an estimated uncertainty of $25 billion for required OPEC investment will have emerged.

Moreover, it can prove very costly if we do not get our sums right. Over-investment may result in excessive, idle capacity, while under-investment may lead to a crude shortage. Both cases could create serious price volatility.

Now, for those people who feel uncomfortable about the size of OPEC’s role in all of this, especially with regard to the so-called battle for energy dominance, let me state the following.

Market order and stability are as much in the interests of producers as they are of consumers. This is especially the case for producers from the developing world. The economic fortunes of OPEC’s Member Countries are heavily dependant upon their oil revenues. In 2003, for OPEC as a whole, oil export revenue as a proportion of total export revenue averaged 68 per cent. The receipt of steady, reasonable levels of revenue helps these countries develop and diversify their economies through investment in physical and social infrastructure, to set them on the path to sustainable growth.

Furthermore, OPEC recognises the powerful symmetry that exists in the oil market, in that a steady, predictable inflow of oil revenues now contributes towards providing the funds required for investment in future oil production capacity, to enable secure, stable supplies for consumers in the years ahead. This, in itself, should dismiss the idea of a battle for energy dominance. Also, the international community is increasingly aware of the importance of stabilising the prices of all primary commodities, to avoid harmful volatility.

These factors alone demonstrate why OPEC is committed to the achievement of order and stability, with reasonable prices, secure supply, predictable demand and fair returns to investors. These are, indeed, all objectives that find expression in the OPEC Statute that was drafted shortly after OPEC’s establishment in 1960 and that have provided the guiding principles for our actions ever since. Moreover, they have as much validity today as they did four decades ago. They are manifested in OPEC’s decisions and actions and, most visibly, in its market-stabilisation measures.

Such measures are necessary because, in the final analysis, the oil market is inherently volatile — as has been demonstrated repeatedly in the past and was particularly apparent in 2004 — and this is the exact opposite of what is required from a commodity that has such a central role to play in the modern world. There is a pressing need, therefore, to maintain order and to stabilise prices, so as to ensure efficiency and security of supply, for both now and the future. In reaching our agreements, in a transparent manner and after careful consideration of the prevailing market outlook, we have the welfare of both producers and consumers in mind, as well as that of the global economy at large. Thus all responsible parties in the market stand to benefit from their success.

On the other hand, we are not miracle-workers. Oil prices are — and will remain — subject to a wide range of influences, and some of these are highly unpredictable in nature and beyond OPEC’s control — again, I refer to 2004, when, as a result of this, OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures were less effective than usual. However, we are constantly monitoring market developments, and the many years of experience we have had in the oil market have enhanced our ability to respond to sudden, unexpected turns of events in a timely and appropriate manner.

Nevertheless, to achieve the maximum effectiveness in this, we require the full cooperation and support of the other leading parties in the industry. There has been much welcome progress in this regard in recent years, on both a bilateral and multilateral basis.

In the context of Europe, the EU and OPEC announced earlier this year the launching of formal dialogue at a senior level. This would revolve around the interdependence between our two groups, with regard to the oil market and the flow of goods and services, and the fact that the EU is OPEC’s main trading partner. It was proposed that the scope of the dialogue would entail expanding cooperation, exchanging information and exploring the possibility of holding joint activities and technical meetings. This would come on top of the fruitful contacts that already exist among Members of our two groups, for example, the Euro-Mediterranean dialogue and the EuroGulf Dialogue for Energy Stability and Sustainability, which was launched in 2002 with the objective of enhancing cooperation between the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Let me close by looking at the current situation in the world oil market.

As you know, nominal oil prices reached record levels for OPEC’s Reference Basket earlier this month, $52.93/b, and this exceeded previous highs that were recorded six months earlier. We put the high prices down to mainly: continued strong oil demand, led by a solid world economic performance; the late and lasting cold spell in the Northern Hemisphere; increasing market anxiety over forward capacity tightness, coupled with geopolitical tensions; and the expectation of the strong demand outstripping non-OPEC supply growth in the medium term. The resultant bullish bias has been exacerbated by the rising activity of non-commercials, in particular pension and index funds, leading to further upward price spirals.

Nevertheless, global oil supply — particularly OPEC output — remains adequate to meet expected demand. Indeed, supply was ahead of for most of 2004, resulting in a tangible OECD stock-build that will continue in the second quarter of 2005.

Our latest forecasts show average annual world oil demand rising by 1.9 mb/d to 84.0 mb/d in 2005. However, non-OPEC supply — which includes OPEC natural gas liquids and non-conventional oils in this analysis — will not keep pace with this, with a projected increase of only 1.2 mb/d, to reach an average of 54.9 mb/d. This means that there will be a difference of 29.1 mb/d for OPEC crude to fill.

During the course of this year, average OPEC production capacity is expected to rise to 32.7 mb/d, as additional projects are brought on-stream, including those that began at the end of 2004, in response to the tight market conditions. Indeed, the bulk of this is expected to be ready by the second half of 2005, and it includes a range of light, medium and heavy crudes.

In proportionate terms, OPEC’s spare capacity, which, at one stage, dipped to around five per cent in 2004, now stands at more than 2 mb/d, or eight per cent, and is expected to exceed 3 mb/d by year-end. Thus, we should be looking at spare capacity levels of around ten per cent — interestingly, this reflects the experiences of much of the past ten years or so.

Peering a bit further ahead, OPEC is committed to expanding capacity above this level, and present expectations are for the addition of another 3.5–4.0 mb/d between 2006 and 2010.

This should allow prices, overall, to continue to moderate, as the oil market returns to a situation of improved stability, such as we had earlier in this decade. And, while it is difficult to know, at present, the corresponding price range for the short-to-medium term, I believe we are likely to see the price of OPEC’s Reference Basket settling above a minimum of $30/b — to ensure adequate investment — but below the level that would begin to have an impact on global economic growth or induce irreversible and undesirable policy-response measures. Given historical trends, it is hard to imagine an upper end much above $50/b for West Texas Intermediate in real terms — notwithstanding some hopefully infrequent price spikes here and there.

Therefore, we are confident that the market will continue to be well-supplied with crude throughout this year and well into the future, to support the robust economic growth that is expected during that period in both the developed and developing worlds.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/339-18-april-2005.html"
"2005-04-04","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Two thousand and four was an unusual year for the international oil market. Some people even describe it as a unique year. Whether or not it was unique is open to debate. However, the real question facing us today is: “Was it a landmark year?”. When we look back over the past 15 months or so, can we detect a fundamental change in the market’s behaviour, in the way, for example, that it responds to external impulses?

[Slide 2] There is certainly some compelling evidence to support such a contention. Prices that rise dramatically, even though the market remains well-supplied with oil. The pressure that downstream bottlenecks are putting on upstream prices, particularly in the United States of America, where refining margins are large and the differential between West Texas Intermediate and the OPEC Reference Basket has been growing steadily. A fulcrum shift in energy demand towards Asia, especially China and — to a lesser extent so far — India, and the sheer potential volumes involved in this for the future. The feeling that, for the first time for many years, non-OPEC producers are feeling the pressure in trying to keep up with incremental demand. And the market’s reluctance to react adequately sometimes to OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures, however rigorously such measures have been derived and applied.

Another significant influence on prices over the past 15 months has been geopolitical in nature, and this has affected some of the key producing areas across the world. There are two observations here. First, some of the geopolitical tensions that have occurred during this period — even if they have had, or are still having, a discernible impact on world prices — are nevertheless temporary in nature and cannot be seen as constituting a shift in fundamentals. But secondly, are we detecting the earliest signs of an easing of tensions in certain areas of the Middle East at the present time, in a manner that could affect oil market fundamentals in the not-too-distant future?

These are all points that demand our attention. On the other hand, however, certain realities remain unchanged. In the final analysis and with the appropriate passage of time, the international oil market is still subject to the basic laws of supply and demand. It experiences cyclical movements on all time-horizons, and these — when examined carefully in the proper historical setting — indicate underlying trends. And, of course, it is necessary to ensure that there is always enough oil around to meet consumer needs at any one time, and this, in turn, requires sound investment strategies.

In the light of all this, I am grateful to have the opportunity to address you here today at the 13th Annual Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference, and I wish to thank the organisers for their kind invitation. While I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question I posed — “Was 2004 a landmark year?” — the elements I have introduced in seeking to assess this matter at least provide the grounds for stimulating discussions among the distinguished panellists and audience. Perhaps we shall have to wait another five or ten years to know the answer to my question, to a time when we will be able to view the situation from a broader historical perspective.

In looking at the recent market performance, two important points spring to mind.

[Slide 3] The first concerns real prices. Let us put the present price levels in their proper historical context. Today’s prices, although high in nominal terms, are less than half the levels witnessed 20 years ago, in real terms. This is when we take into account inflation and exchange rate movements. In other words, the average nominal price of around $36/b for the Reference Basket last year would, in real terms, correspond to a price of $80/b in 1982. This is in spite of the fact that oil demand is now much higher and the world — that is, the richer part — much wealthier!

[Slide 4] If we look at OPEC’s price band, which was suspended by our Conference in January so that it could be reviewed in the light of the current unusual market developments, we see that, in real terms, if the band is adjusted for exchange rates and inflation, its limits would be between around $28/b and $36/b now, instead of the original $22–28/b at the time of its introduction in the year 2000. It should also be noted that, during the first three full years of the band’s use, 2001–03, the average annual nominal price of our Reference Basket was close to the middle of the range of the band.

And the second point concerns OPEC’s actions and its commitment to stability. It is all-too-easy to refer to OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures in a matter-of-fact manner. But, if we step back and think for a moment, this is a group of the world’s leading oil producers — all developing countries — taking it upon themselves to see that the international oil market performs in a manner which is orderly, stable and secure, to the benefit of producers and consumers alike.

Our Member Countries recognise that they are an integral part of the global economy and have a responsibility to ensure that their oil makes an effective, smooth and meaningful contribution to industrial, commercial and domestic life, in both the industrialised and — increasingly — developing worlds. This can best be done in a sustainable manner if every effort is made to remove excesses and volatility from the market. We are in the market for the long term. The oil revenues we receive play an important part in developing our domestic economies, for the benefit of our present and future generations. Accordingly, we know where our priorities lie — stability, security, sustainability.

This brings me directly onto the subject of production capacity. The availability of sufficient production capacity at all times is like a passport to the future of a viable oil industry. It is necessary: to meet the forecast absolute increase in demand; to replace natural declines in production; and to ensure that oil producers always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply. Also, the oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before, and this will aided by continued steady advances in technology.

“Capacity” appeared to be one of the most heavily used words in the oil market last year! It seemed to have as much importance to the psychology of the market, as to the physical quantities involved. Perhaps this goes some way to explaining why prices kept rising, even when the market was well-supplied with crude. It was, in this sense, about perceptions. Classical Keynesian economics! The mere possibility of a shortage of crude in the near future could be enough to drive up prices.

Let us look at the situation now.

[Slide 5] Oil prices, after returning to a more moderate average of just under $36/b in December — very much in response to OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures — began to rise again early in the New Year. [Slide 6] They reached record levels for OPEC’s Reference Basket in March.

[Slide 7] However, these record levels are still not far above the upper limit of the price band, if the band is expressed in real prices, with the base month of June 2000 — and this is during a period when prices have been affected by such an unusual combination of pressures.

We put the high prices down to mainly: continued strong oil demand, led by a solid world economic performance; the late and lasting cold spell in the Northern Hemisphere; increasing market anxiety over forward capacity tightness, coupled with geopolitical tensions; and the expectation of the strong demand outstripping non-OPEC supply growth in the medium term. The resultant bullish bias was exacerbated by the rising activity of non-commercials, in particular pension and index funds, leading to further upward price spirals.

Nevertheless, global oil supply — particularly OPEC output — remains adequate to meet expected demand. OPEC’s spare capacity, which, at one stage, dipped to around five per cent in 2004, now stands at more than 2 mb/d, or eight per cent, and is expected to exceed 3 mb/d by year-end. However, the extent of this will depend upon the level of demand during the year.

[Slide 8] Our latest forecasts show average annual world oil demand rising by 1.9 million barrels a day to 84.0 mb/d in 2005. However, non-OPEC supply — which includes OPEC natural gas liquids and non-conventional oils in this analysis — will not keep pace with this, with a projected increase of only 1.3 mb/d, to reach an average of 55.0 mb/d. This means that there will be a difference of 29.0 mb/d for OPEC crude to fill. This average difference is 0.6 mb/d higher than that for 2004.

[Slide 9] To illustrate the difficulties facing non-OPEC supply in keeping up with incremental demand, let us take a snapshot of what we thought would happen in the market in 2004 and compare it with a snapshot of what really happened. To do this, I shall compare the forecasts that appeared in the March 2004 issue of OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report with the early estimates of what happened that appeared in the March 2005 issue, exactly one year later. In the earlier issue, average annual world oil demand was forecast to rise by 1.4 mb/d in 2004, from 2003, compared with the preliminary estimate of 2.6 mb/d which actually occurred last year. In other words, the actual rise in world oil demand was almost double the expectations of one year ago. However, in spite of this, non-OPEC supply, which was forecast, 12 months ago, to rise by 1.6 mb/d, instead actually grew by less than this amount, 1.4 mb/d. To complete the picture, the difference between world oil demand and non-OPEC supply increased by 1.2 mb/d, rather than decreasing by 0.2 mb/d, as had been forecast in March 2004. The difference is met by OPEC supply, as well as through stock level movements.

[Slide 10] For the forecast of the difference between world oil demand and non-OPEC supply in 2005, there has been an almost unbroken series of upward revisions over the past nine months, from 27.4 mb/d in July 2004 to the present figure of 29.0 mb/d.

But the situation involves more than just the upstream. Although the physical crude oil market is, at present, well enough supplied to meet demand and allow the continued rise in stocks to their five-year-average days of cover, downstream strains — stemming mainly from capacity tightness to match strong light-product demand with more stringent quality specifications — are expected to continue exerting pressure on both product and crude prices.

On the economic front, with regard to the near-term future, one key focus of attention concerns the prospects for future economic growth and hence oil demand growth. The cyclical nature of economic activity suggests that the current exceptional rates of economic growth cannot continue indefinitely. There is increasing concern over growing imbalances, especially in the light of the large twin deficits of the United States of America, with the potential associated risks to financial stability and world economic growth.

In Asia, the spotlight is on both China and India, due to their high levels of growth in 2004. [Slide 11] In China, the authorities’ efforts to slow the economy over the past nine months have had some success, although the slowdown in industrial activity has been moderate so far; however, fiscal and monetary policies are expected to tighten in 2005. In India, GDP growth is forecast to rise slightly to 6.5 per cent in 2005, compared with a provisional estimate of 6.0 per cent last year. Conversely, one must observe that the Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade, although there is optimism about the country’s prospects later in the year.

In the oil sector, early forecasts see a halving of the rate of oil demand growth in China, although this will be from an extremely high average level of 17 per cent in 2004 to a still-high level of nearly eight per cent this year.

[Slide 12] Indeed, oil plays a significant role at peak load times or when there is an unexpectedly strong demand surge, as we have been witnessing in China recently, with the jumps in diesel demand of around 300,000 b/d and 500,000 b/d in the last two years.

More generally, as I mentioned earlier, the new requirement to adopt stricter product specifications in Asia, in addition to those already in force in Europe and the USA, could again focus price pressure on light sweet crudes, possibly triggering a substantial widening of the spread between sour and sweet grades, as was seen in the international market in the second half of 2004.

[Slide 13] These issues come on top of the continuing uncertainty over the duration and intensity of some of the other destabilising factors that had such a negative impact on the market last year.

Let us now look at the longer term, using the reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model, to see how the situation may develop in the oil market in the first quarter of the 21st century.

[Slide 14] Our projections are based on an average annual world economic growth rate of 3.5 per cent for the period up to 2025. The forecast rate of almost 5.0 per cent for the developing countries will be double the OECD’s projected 2.4 per cent.

[Slide 15] In line with this, global oil demand will rise by 28 million barrels a day to 111 mb/d by 2025 — an annual average growth rate of 1.5 mb/d. OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of world oil demand.

[Slide 16] However, four-fifths of the increase in demand over the next 20 years will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth.

[Slide 17] The transportation sector will account for almost 60 per cent of the rise in global oil demand over the next two decades. This will amount to nearly all the growth in oil demand in the transition economies, more than four-fifths in the OECD and close to half in the developing countries.

[Slide 18] Turning to supply, let me start by saying that the world can rest assured that there should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. Not only are we talking about conventional oil, but also there is also unconventional oil, such as tar sands. There is also vast potential for making new discoveries, as well as increasing the yield from wells when they are on-stream.

[Slide 19] As the cumulative amount of oil that has been produced, by definition, rises with time, so does the size of the world’s total resource base. Sometimes the gap narrows and sometimes it increases. Even by 2025, if the resource base remains the same as it is now, we should still have used less than half of it. But, with advancing technology, enhanced recovery from existing fields and the development of new ones, often in remote areas, the resource base is expected to continue growing, with the passage of time. In the light of this, the world’s oil resource base should not be seen as a constraint, in meeting future demand.

[Slide 20] Our projections for the period up to 2025 show that overall non-OPEC output will continue to increase, but more slowly, reaching a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. This represents a rise of 5–7 mb/d from 2004, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty. The key sources for the increase in non-OPEC supply will be Russia, the Caspian, Latin America and Africa.

Thus, in the light of all this, OPEC will be called upon increasingly to supply the incremental barrel. OPEC has both the capability and the will to do this. Around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves are located in OPEC’s Member Countries. Moreover, these reserves, which are mostly on land, are more accessible and cheaper to exploit than those in non-OPEC areas. In 2025, the reference case sees OPEC meeting almost half the world’s oil demand, at 49 per cent, with 55 mb/d.

[Slide 21] One of the basic challenges facing OPEC — and other oil producers too — is to ensure that sufficient, but not excessive, production capacity will be available at all times to help meet the forecast rise in oil demand. This brings us onto the subject of investment.

[Slides 22 and 23] The required global investment will be large, although it will not necessarily be different in magnitude to that observed in the past. Also, the cost of investment in OPEC oil is much lower than in non-OPEC oil, yielding more than a fourfold multiple, in terms of new production capacity for the same level of investment.

These are all big challenges facing the oil industry. Can it cope?

The industry has experienced radical change since the early 1990s. The spate of mergers and acquisitions — at all levels — has sharpened the industry’s competitive edge, through enhanced efficiency and cost-cutting measures. There has been a comprehensive repositioning of the industry, with better financial capabilities and continued advances in technology. Oil companies have, in general, broadened their base, evolving into corporate energy units.

How does all of this affect OPEC’s Member Countries? In such an evolving landscape, our national oil companies must increasingly face new challenges and opportunities. At the same time, our Governments and Petroleum Ministries will continue to adapt to these new realities.

The way in which our Member Countries respond to this varies, in accordance with their individual economic, social and political dynamics and values, while, at the same time, they seek to adhere to OPEC’s objectives and decisions as best they can. This can prove to be a delicate balancing act.

The receipt of steady, reasonable levels of revenue offers significant potential benefits for these countries. The challenge has been — and remains — to use the oil revenues, or rent, to develop and diversify their economies through investment in physical and social infrastructure, as well as growth in the non-oil sector. In other words, it is to diversify their economies and prepare for a smooth transition to sustainable development for the post-oil era, whenever that occurs in each individual case.

On top of this, there are potential advantages at a broader, international economic level, whereby the petroleum revenues can contribute towards providing the funds required for investment in future oil production capacity, to enable secure, stable supplies for consumers in the years ahead. Indeed, there is an obvious symmetry here, because an orderly market will in itself result in future sound revenue viability.

[Slide 24] However, when we look at the future, we find ourselves many uncertainties, making it very difficult to produce meaningful forecasts that will help us with our investment plans, even for the short and medium terms. These include future non-OPEC production levels, economic growth, government policies and the rate of development and diffusion of newer technologies. Over-investment may result in excessive, costly, idle capacity, leading to downward pressure on prices, while under-investment may result in a shortage of crude and higher prices.

[Slide 25] To illustrate just how significant uncertainties can be to investment plans, if we return to our scenarios and reduce our global economic growth projections by just one percentage point, we will find that this will lower the investment requirement for 2010 from a reference case $95 bn to $70 bn — which is a big difference. In 2025, the gap will be a massive $124 bn.

Now it is impossible, of course, to predict at this stage whether the eventual outcome will be closer to our reference case scenario than to a low- or high-economic-growth scenario. But we do believe that, if there is a variance, it is more likely to be on the downside, rather than the upside. This would then have a serious impact on the revenue expectations of our Member Countries in the years ahead, adversely affecting their development and investment plans.

All of this places a premium on consistency, transparency and certainty within the international oil community — as well as a broad-based, equitable approach — when it comes to planning for the future and doing so in a manner that is in harmony with the requirements of the global economy.

[Slide 26] The industry, therefore, is much better-off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of handling the major issues of mutual concern — such as price stability, security of demand and supply, investment, environmental issues and sustainable development.

This is why we welcome and encourage the big advances in producer/consumer dialogue and cooperation that have occurred across the industry in recent years. Meetings such as this play an important part in the process, by enabling people from across the industry to mix with each other, discuss issues of topical interest, exchange ideas and establish contacts which could be of mutual benefit in the future.

While it is too early to say whether we are experiencing a period of fundamental change in the industry, at least our deliberations here this week are providing us with the opportunity to reflect upon these matters, and this, in itself, will enhance our vision as we plan for the future of the industry.

[Slide 27] What we can say with assurance, however, is that there is enough oil around to meet the world’s growing energy needs for decades to come and that it is up to all of us to ensure that it is brought to the market in an orderly, secure and stable manner at all times.

[Slide 28] Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/340-4-april-2005.html"
"2005-03-24","It gives me great pleasure to be here with you today at your kind invitation to talk about an Organization whose name has become a household name in global energy discussions, but whose objectives and activities are often misunderstood. I am speaking about the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In my address, I want to give you a brief history about our Organization, look at some of the issues shaping the current and future global oil industry, and offer an insight into how OPEC is responding to the challenges of the 21st century.

But first, I would like to say a few words about our deep-rooted friendship with your beautiful city, which has been our home for 40 years now. We first set foot on Austrian soil in September 1965 at the invitation of the Federal Government and the city of Vienna, as part of their commendable plan to turn the city into a major centre for intergovernmental organizations and other international bodies. Their far-sighted internationalist policy was a major source of attraction to our Organization. We were also drawn by the congenial working environment and warm hospitality of our hosts and very quickly realized that we had taken the right decision to settle here. We celebrated our move from Geneva with the 10th Meeting of our Ministerial Conference in December 1965. Since that time, and including our last Conference held earlier this month, we have convened 125 Ministerial Meetings, with a large proportion being held in the Austrian capital. We look forward to a continuation of this excellent relationship in the years to come.

This year, Austria marks its 10th anniversary as a member of the European Union (EU), where it has matured into a well-developed market economy, with a high standard of living. It is closely tied to other economies of the EU, especially Germany, and has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by the country’s access to the single European market and its proximity to other aspirant economies. There is actually an interesting parallel in the development of both the EU and OPEC. Both have their roots in commodity organizations, set up in the period of reconstruction after the Second World War, when a new international economic and political order was emerging and people were coming to terms with a new set of realities that cut across national borders. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up with six founder members in 1951, while OPEC followed nine years later with five signatories (slide 2). The pressing, practical need for economic and political solidarity, with regard to the roles of these three industries in the rapidly expanding international arena, was common to both groups. By the time OPEC was formed, the Treaty of Rome had been signed, and subsequent developments led to the prosperous EU as we know it today. OPEC, on the other hand, has advanced in different ways. While remaining essentially a single-commodity Organization, due mainly to the geographical spread and cultural diversity among our Members, we have continued to gain countless years of expertise in oil matters. However our development path, measured by per capita GDP growth, has not been on average steady, in contrast to the impressive steady rise seen in the EU.

In the light of this history, and the fact that the EU has continued to widen its reach, we were extremely gratified in OPEC earlier this year to receive a proposal from Brussels to establish an EU-OPEC energy dialogue. This will take place at the most senior level, on the basis of biannual meetings, with the dialogue aimed at furthering constructive cooperation between oil producers and consumers.

Let me now turn to our Organization and the reasons for its formation. OPEC was founded in Baghdad, Iraq on 14 September 1960 against a background of great change. (slide 3) The post-World War Two period of reconstruction was over and the consumer society was in full swing. Cars were becoming bigger and thirstier and air travel was more affordable for the masses. At the time, a prominent Western Prime Minister declared: “We’ve never had it so good!” He was not far wrong, but, of course, he was referring to how the richer part of the world lived. In the poorer regions – and home to the vast majority – many countries were breaking free from colonialism and gaining independence. In reality, however, most of these states had little choice but to maintain their longstanding role of servicing the needs of the richer nations, supplying them with the raw materials and other basic goods that perpetuated their prosperous lifestyles. Oil is the perfect example of how such a raw material was exploited. If one commodity can claim credit for the startling advances seen in the world in the 20th century, in particular in developed industrialized countries, it was crude - soon to be dubbed “black gold”. The richer nations relied heavily on the crude oil deposits found in abundance in some developing countries, exploiting these resources at unreasonably low prices.

It is important to know that for all of the first half of the 20th century, major oil companies from the industrialized world determined the quantity of crude oil produced from the poorer nations, the price at which this oil was sold, and, to cap it all, what share to give to the owner of the natural resource. This was part of the one-sided concessionary agreement made under mostly colonial rule. And with this accord binding, the impoverished producer nations were limited in what they could do. But the final straw came when the dominant multinational oil companies – the renowned “Seven Sisters” – announced yet another unilateral reduction in the posted price of their crude, following the imposition of import controls in the United States. This apparent loss of earnings did not actually give a true picture, since these very same companies – the Seven Sisters - made up any revenue shortfall on the sale of oil products, which they also controlled. However, the reduction in the crude price was, of course, to the further detriment of the producing countries. (slide 4) To defend their patrimonial interests, representatives from five oil-producing developing states – Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela – met in Baghdad on 10 September 1960 to find a means of asserting legitimate sovereign rights over their own natural resources. Four days later, they made the collective decision that they could no longer stand by and watch as their domestic oil resources were unfairly exploited, and OPEC was born. The five Founding Members were soon joined by other oil-producing developing nations, which were in a similar predicament and looking for the benefits such solidarity could bring.

[Today, our membership numbers 11, with the addition of Qatar in 1961, Indonesia and Libya in 1962, Algeria in 1969, Nigeria in 1971, and the United Arab Emirates in 1974, which actually took over the membership of Abu Dhabi, which joined in 1967.] (slide 5) The total population of OPEC’s Members is around half a billion and although there is a multiplicity of political, economic and social systems, as well as cultures, languages and religions, their commonality of interest is derived from their status as developing countries with abundant supplies of one resource - crude oil - the sales of which provide the bulk of their export revenues (slide 6). Two fundamental objectives have formed the cornerstone of the Organization’s existence. These comprise establishing and maintaining a stable oil market with fair and reasonable prices, both for producers and consumers; and securing a fair return for producers and investors from the sale of Member Countries’ oil.

(slide 7) Turning the clock forward to the present day, we see a very different world to the one OPEC encountered all those years ago. Advances in technology have virtually transformed everything that touches us in our day-to-day lives, bringing with it a massive rise in global energy consumption. There are many more cars, many more planes, in fact more of every type of consumer commodity and service … for those who can afford them, of course. Sadly, millions of people in the poorest countries of the world remain poor and have not benefited from this economic miracle. Admittedly, for OPEC, the resultant surge in global oil consumption has been good news for the economic welfare of its Members, but the past years could in no way be termed as being easy. OPEC has had to overcome numerous difficult challenges — from a series of price crises, to conflicts between some of its Members. In fact, during the more difficult times, its demise was predicted on more than one occasion. But, I am here today to tell you that the strength of unity among our Members has consistently prevailed.

(slide 8) So what of the modern-day oil market? Well, the industry has been at the centre of some quite unique developments over the past couple of years. We have seen successive record highs for nominal crude prices since the autumn of last year. In fact the price of our OPEC Reference Basket of seven crudes, which we use as a barometer on pricing, broke through the $50 a barrel mark earlier this month, which was both extraordinary and disconcerting. Unfortunately, the very market fundamentals that OPEC can and does have influence over – concerning levels of supply – have not been the driving force behind the unprecedented price rise. (slide 9) A combination of factors, including a sudden and unanticipated surge in demand in Asia and the United States, geopolitical tensions, refining and distribution bottlenecks, and the effects of the hurricanes seen in the Americas last year, actually pushed prices to record levels in nominal terms. But the cycle did not stop there. The oil futures markets played a major role in amplifying the price rise as evidenced by the increased activities of speculative investments by hedge and pensions funds in futures markets fuelled by the perception of continued demand strength and oil market tightness in the years ahead. This phenomenon is threatening the formation of an oil price bubble not dissimilar to that of technology stocks prices a few years ago. As a result, prices have just kept on rising, more lately influenced by strong demand brought on by a late cold snap in the Northern Hemisphere.

(slide 10) It is important to stress that, even though prices today are considered extremely high, in real terms they are still half the levels seen in the 1980s, when the price of a barrel of crude in today’s money had reached more than 80 dollars. All recent studies show that apparently the global economy has not so far suffered as a result of the higher prices. In fact, we have observed that the larger economies have managed to cope very well with the increased fuel costs, indicative perhaps of the robustness of their fiscal standing and decrease in energy intensity in the OECD countries. But despite this somewhat rosy picture, we cannot afford to be complacent, since unreasonably high oil prices over a sustained period can be detrimental to the health of the global economy, in particular in developing countries. (slide 11) As to whether we have entered a new era, characterized by higher oil prices, it is, I think, still too early to say.

The rise in crude prices has inevitably led to an increase in the price consumers, such as motorists, have to pay for their petrol, although the impact varies from minimal, or hardly noticeable - as in Europe – to very significant, as in the US (slide 12). Average retail prices for gasoline have hit a new all-time high in the United States, but, once again, we have to mention that when comparing prices in nominal and real terms, the two dollar a gallon gasoline seen in the US earlier this week is a fraction of the 3.5 dollars price reached in the early 1980s in terms of today’s money. (slide 13) Our calculations show that since February 2004 the price of gasoline in the US has increased by an average of around 16 per cent. (slide 14) In Europe, the increase has been considerably smaller - averaging around six per cent, and influenced by the dollar/euro exchange rate, and the fact that there are considerably higher taxes on the end product than those across the Atlantic. You may remember that the issue of high taxes was the subject of widespread fuel protests a few years ago in the United Kingdom, where 80 per cent of the final price was going into government coffers. Today, that figure is still very high at around 73 per cent. Apart from hitting the motorist, such high taxation levels reduce the earning power of the producers, a situation which is especially felt at times of low oil prices. (slide 15) It is, therefore, interesting to note that when you fill up your petrol tank in Vienna today, 61 per cent of what you pay is taken by the Austrian government in tax, while under 22 per cent goes to the producer of the crude – domestic or foreign. The remainder is the industry take - for the companies, refiners, transportation etc. When we look at Europe as a whole, an average 68 per cent of the final product price paid by motorists goes to the national treasuries, while producing countries earn around 20 per cent. Quite frankly, we in OPEC consider these levels of taxation as unreasonable. A more flexible and balanced approach to this taxation by the governments concerned would go a long way to helping both the producer, during a period of low prices, and the end-consumer, when prices soar, as they have today. On this subject of taxation, you might be interested to know that some OPEC Countries have actually proposed supplying European countries with their crude free-of-charge, on the condition they hand over just half of the revenue they earn from taxing that oil, at existing levels Such an arrangement would be good for the consumer, good for the producer … yet not so good for the treasuries of the consuming countries. Needless to say, such proposals have consistently been ignored.

It has been said in many quarters that OPEC Members are only really concerned with getting the highest price they can for the oil they sell. Well, I have to tell you that this is a misconception. Of course, our Members wish to optimize the revenues they can glean from their oil exports – this is natural. But OPEC was, and remains, very concerned when prices rise to unreasonably high levels. We fully recognize that it is not in the interest of the global economy, of which we are an integral part, or those of developing states, the emerging economies, and especially the least-developed countries, to have the price of oil at unsustainably high levels. Even from a self-seeking perspective, OPEC would not like the price of oil to be so high as to make it less competitive as an energy source and encourage the development of costly alternatives, to its own detriment, and that of the world. That would be counterproductive to our efforts of attaining optimum revenues. (slide 16) And as for OPEC being concerned, well we have met on no fewer than seven occasions since February 2004, successively raising production by some 4 million b/d in our bid to bring prices back to more reasonable levels. At our last Meeting in Isfahan earlier this month, we agreed to increase production again to try and stem the price rise. If that does not work, we are ready to consider another production increase, most probably in April or May, if necessary. It is important that we explore all avenues to restore order to the market. But with other forces at work, unfortunately there is only so much OPEC can do.

It is no secret that, over the years, many consuming countries, including some who are producers, have advocated an international oil market, free of all controls and outside influence. Well, as the experiences of the past, present and most likely the future have shown, that approach simply does not work – certainly not with something as important, diverse and complex as the global oil sector. Of all the commodities traded on world markets every day, oil is without doubt the most vital and subject to inevitable volatility, downstream bottlenecks, often erratic supply patterns, and sudden unforeseen changes, which can especially affect prices. It therefore requires some form of management or regulation, some kind of stabilizing apparatus, to prevent prices from crashing or soaring. But implementing some level of control is not a new concept. If we look back to the early years of the 20th Century, we can see that the first moves towards attempting to balance supply and demand, which ultimately affected prices, were made by the United States Texas Railroad Commission. This agency was actually established in 1891 with the initial mandate to regulate rail commerce, but in 1917 was given the power to regulate oil pipelines, which were regarded to be ""common carriers"", like railroads. The Commission was further empowered to take steps to prevent the “waste” of oil and gas. By 1931, the commission had so expanded its power that it introduced a monthly production allowance – similar to OPEC’s current quota system -, which dictated what per cent of maximum production wells in Texas could pump. Four years later, US Congress endorsed the establishment of the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, which comprised six states and had the mission “to promote the conservation and efficient recovery of domestic oil and natural gas resources, while protecting health, safety and the environment”. Both these entities had the prime function of controlling production, with a view to maintaining a certain level of price and stability. Later, the Seven Sisters took up the mantle and exercised an even stronger hold on output and pricing. But these were private companies with only a vested interest in making profits for their shareholders, irrespective of the interests of the public owners of this valuable resource.

Today, and especially with non-fundamental factors – such as speculation in oil futures markets - playing such a critical role in oil price determination, we feel that leaving such a sensitive trading environment as the oil market to its own devices would surely be a recipe for disaster, both for producers and consumers. Hence our continued commitment to ensuring market stability.

Ladies and gentlemen,

The global economy of the 21st century is far removed from the world economic order OPEC encountered at its outset. Today, globalization is proving to be a powerful force of transformation, opening up borders to trade, and leading to the creation of new economic blocks that are continuing to undergo rapid social, political and economic change. This has led to the liberalization of the global energy sector with oil industry players adapting their market strategies and increasingly moving towards forming partnerships to meet the new challenges. Environmental concerns have become paramount, and the dimensions and complexities of the contemporary and technological challenges facing both producers and consumers are considerable.

In this new global environment (slide 17), it is more important than ever that oil supplies remain secure and the market stable. The clear fact is that for prices to be sustainable and acceptable to both producers and consumers, they should neither be too low, nor too high. OPEC requires a level of price that guarantees fair returns to investors and the owners of the valuable natural resources, while the consumers need a price that can be comfortably accommodated to ensure continued robust economic growth. However, I must make one thing clear here. OPEC does not set the price of oil. It has not had this capability since 1980 such has been the growth of producers and production capacity outside the Organization. Today, it is the various markets, comprising spot and futures trading, and the business they generate that mostly determines the price. What OPEC attempts to do is influence prices to settle in a range that is comfortable and acceptable for all market players. This it does by either increasing or reducing production, and consequently, supply. But our Members are always seeking to attain a level of price that will guarantee acceptable revenues and an adequate return on their investment. In 2000, our Ministers identified an oil price band of between 22 dollars and 28 dollars a barrel for an OPEC Reference Basket of seven crudes, which they considered to be fair and reasonable, as well as being consistent with the market stability they were seeking (slide 18). Prior to 2004, and following the difficult years of the late 1990s, when the Asian financial crisis caused prices to drop to under 10 dollars a barrel, the price band helped maintain relative stability in the international oil market for four years up to the end of 2003. During this period, the price of the OPEC Basket stayed comfortably within the range of the band. However, earlier this year, following the sustained escalation in prices, our Ministers suspended the price band, feeling that, realistically, it needed to be reviewed. That process is currently ongoing. It was actually not the first time we had attempted to have a target price, although this was the first time we specified a range. In the 1980s, we sought a price for our Basket of 18 dollars a barrel, and in the following decade we increased this to 21 dollars. Both attempts were not greeted with that much success, such was the acute volatility seen in the oil market during that time-span.

Future outlook

(slide 19) It is already certain that, for the foreseeable future, oil will maintain its leading position in supplying the world’s growing energy needs. OPEC, in accounting for nearly 80 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves – which currently amount to 1,137 billion barrels – will be called upon to supply the extra oil the world will need in the years ahead. And make no mistake, our Members have both the will and capability to do this. They are committed to ensuring that consumers receive regular, secure and sufficient amounts of oil to fuel their growing economies. But equally important for the producers, they require security of demand – to be firm in the knowledge that there will always be a market for their oil and that governments will not take steps aimed at reducing oil flows and hence leaving the producers with costly idle capacity.

(slide 20) Looking at the latest forecasts drawn up by our Secretariat here in Vienna, world economic growth is expected to expand by around 3.6 percent annually over the next 20 years. In keeping with this forecast, oil demand is set to rise by 28 million b/d to reach 111 million b/d by 2025, representing annual average growth of 1.5 million b/d, as against average expansion of some 2.2 million b/d in 2004 and 2005 combined. With non-OPEC oil production in the first two decades of this century forecast to reach its plateau, OPEC Member Countries will be relied upon to supply the lion’s share of the new demand, especially those in Asia. OECD countries will continue to account for the biggest proportion of world oil demand as the region’s economies register average annual economic growth of 2.5 per cent up to 2025. (slide 21) However, almost 75 per cent of the increase in global oil demand will come from the developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. Asian countries, home to half the world’s population, are forecast to experience annual economic growth of over 5 per cent up to 2020, and will remain the key source of oil demand in the developing world. Our figures show that, up to 2025, the region, which has emerged as a key player in global markets for commodities, manufacturing and services, is expected to account for a rise of 18 million b/d in oil demand, which represents 65 percent of the total in all developing states. (slide 22) China, [ with annual economic growth projected at around 6.6 per cent, and India, [with growth of about 5.5 per cent per annum,] will be central to this expansion, boosted by an expected boom in the transportation sector. The huge potential for growth in this sector is clear from the low density of vehicles in these two countries, which stands at just over 10 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with over 500 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in the OECD region. In fact, transportation is forecast to account for almost 60 per cent of the rise in global oil demand over the next two decades. (slide 23) Overall, if the kind of demand scenario I am painting here comes to fruition, by 2025 OPEC could be producing around 55 million b/d of crude, almost half of all global supply.

(slide 24) OPEC will, of course, need to expand its oil production capacity to meet this extra demand in the future. I am pleased to inform you that following the events of the past two years, where questions have been asked about OPEC’s ability to continue to meet this rising demand, our Member Countries have advanced their capacity-building programmes, aimed at further enhancing their output capabilities (slide 25). Needless to say, the scale of investments our Members will need to make to meet the expected demand growth over the next few decades is enormous. But an important fact to note for the future is that crude oil in OPEC Member Countries is more accessible and cheaper to bring to market than in areas outside the Organization. It actually yields more than a 4-fold multiple in terms of new production capacity for the same investment. The exact magnitude of the required capital injection is subject to large uncertainty (slide 26). Factors such as future economic growth, the extent of the industry’s technological development, as well as polices of consuming countries will have an important bearing on this. In addition, it is important we get our sums right. (slide 27) Over-investment may result in excessive, idle capacity, while under-investment may lead to a shortage of crude. Both inevitably lead to undesirable boom-bust cycles.

The downstream sector of the oil industry will also require substantial investment as it responds to significant challenges in the years ahead. The competitive landscape is being changed by corporate mergers and the formation of both regional and global joint ventures and partnerships. Refining is now a truly global and highly competitive industry which is required to operate in an environment of highly volatile margins. Investors, who now have to meet ever tighter fuel specifications and emission limits, face the same kind of problems as upstream operators, in ensuring that refinery capacity is in tune with crude output. (slide 28) Too little capacity results in refining bottlenecks, which are apparent today, while too much can lead to costly plants being mothballed. But it is a fact that today’s oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before – all to meet the expectations of the modern-day consumer. Already, many changes have been made to ensure that the world uses its oil in a more environmentally harmonious manner, such as more efficient vehicle engines (like diesel in Europe) and cleaner fuels, but one feels that the demands and regulations governing downstream development can only become more stringent in the future – and that will obviously come at a cost.

Turning to supply, the world can rest assured that there is plenty of oil around for decades to come. While there is an understandable call to develop renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind power and hydrogen cells, to name a few, the fact remains that the technology for these applications is still in its infancy. In the meantime, oil has a big role to play in helping to satisfy the energy needs of mankind and to support sustainable development. (slide 29) And just as the cumulative amount of oil that has been produced rises with time, then so does the size of the world’s total resource base. Even by 2025, if the resource base remains the same as it is now, we should still have used less than half of it. But, with advancing technology, enhanced recovery from existing fields, and the development of new reservoirs, the resource base is expected to continue growing in the future. Therefore, the world’s oil resource base should not be seen as a constraint in meeting future demand. The oil industry itself is also benefiting from huge technological advances made in both upstream and downstream operations. (slide 30) Today, because of environmental awareness, we are justifiably impelled to ensure the welfare of our planet. We must ensure that we continue along this ‘green’ path, so that our operations always comply with modern-day standards.. Nobody has the right to pollute the planet, and OPEC’s view, like others, is that it must be preserved for future generations. However, what OPEC seeks is the right to advance the development of its Member Countries in a way that will allow them to prosper and make the best use of their natural resources, in a manner compatible with the preservation of environmental harmony. More constructive dialogue is clearly needed to work out methodologies for the future so that all parties are treated in a fair and equitable manner. (slide 31) Carbon sequestration is one of these methodologies, especially in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery techniques. This process allows more oil to be extracted from a given reservoir, but with the potential harmful emissions from the use of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil, dramatically reduced. Hand in-hand with making fuel cleaner, more efforts should be made to gradually develop renewables and other alternative energy sources - and on the same sound and equitable economic footing.

Ladies and gentlemen,

In conclusion:

Today, the global economy is clearly less sensitive to oil price surges, compared with the situation seen in the 1970s and 1980s, thanks to major advances in energy efficiency and conservation. In simple words, countries are more resilient, and this is borne out by the fact that the global economy experienced strong growth last year in the face of rising oil prices. However,, we still feel that the best – and most sure-footed - way forward for attaining global economic prosperity is for us to have an oil market that is stable, with a fair and equitable price. Today’s oil industry is sprawling, its complex, and its vibrant. It is also made up of a number of key players who rely on it for their survival. These players all have a significant role to play in its welfare, effectiveness, growth, and general evolution. (slide 32) Cooperation and coordination among theses players - the producers, consumers, governments, the large oil companies, and the financial institutions - is a prerequisite for establishing lasting oil market stability and prosperity. We need to monitor its development, identify the driving forces, assess their implications for the global economy, and manage to come up with the right policy decisions – and we need to do this collectively. Over the past few years, steady progress has been made in developing ties with other producers, consumers and even leading institutions. [ … and I can assure you that in all its Meetings, OPEC is always looking to make decisions that will pursue this road of cooperation. We feel, after past experience, that it is the only strategy that can bear fruit and guarantee oil’s success in the future in this ever-demanding, ever-changing world.]

And just as oil has played a key role in fuelling the development of the industrialized countries in the 20th century, it should - and I feel will - play just as important a role in supporting the future growth of the economies of the developing world in the 21st century, where, as I have already stated, the pinnacle of future oil demand - and hence the future welfare of our industry - lies. Let us hope that the progress we have made can be maintained and furthered so that the 21st century will be characterized by an oil market where all players not only prosper, but most importantly, prosper in an environment that reflects fairness and stability.

[Much has been achieved over the years, but the learning curve never ends. OPEC has the proven ability to be innovative and constructive in the policies and decisions it takes. With demand for oil - and gas - set to increase markedly in the years ahead, there is now an ever-greater need to achieve and sustain lasting market order. OPEC stands ready to supply the oil the world requires, but new challenges are continuing to emerge that threaten to throw it off course. That is why our Organization today is meeting more in Conference than at any other time in its history. It has to be vigilant in closely scrutinizing the market’s direction, and it has to be responsive and accurate in taking the right decisions - and at the right time.]

Finally, I want to reiterate that OPEC takes its role in the oil market very seriously as it continues its longstanding efforts to achieve order and stability, with prices that are both reasonable and compatible with steady growth in the world economy, and, of course, to the benefit of producers and consumers alike. But we are convinced that the oil industry is better off if there is an underlying consensus on the means on handling the major issues of mutual concern, such as price stability, security of demand and supply, investment and environmental issues and sustainable development. And I do believe we are now better prepared than ever to meet the challenges the future will surely bring.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/341-24-march-2005.html"
"2005-03-01","Excellency, ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for inviting me to deliver this keynote speech to the 8th Annual Asia Power Conference, on the subject of OPEC’s role in meeting the challenge of sustaining economic growth and the expanding energy needs of Asia.

But, before beginning the speech, let me express, once again — on behalf of OPEC, its Member Countries and all its officials across the world — our deep sorrow over the tragic events of 26 December 2004, as well as our heartfelt wish for a full and timely recovery in the parts of this continent that were devastated by the tsunami. The terrible personal losses and suffering have created wounds that will last for many years, and we offer our compassion and prayers to all those who have lost family and friends, as well as an entire way of life.

Let us now turn to the theme of this address.

With Asia consisting of many rapidly expanding economies and possessing more than half the world’s population, the region is a key player in world markets for commodities, manufacturing and services. There is no doubt that its accelerating integration into the global economic system is offering more opportunities than ever for international trade and commerce, bringing health and prosperity to the Asian people and helping reduce poverty. Stable world markets for commodities — in particular, energy — are therefore of major importance. Asia has now become, in short, one of the main engines of growth for the global economy.

OPEC, for a long time, has recognised this and has sought to ensure that Asia’s rapidly growing oil needs will be met to the full, both now and in the future. Indeed, the region’s economic development is crucial to growth in the international oil market. We recall the events of 1997–98, when the Asian financial crisis and economic downturn were followed by a steep decline in world oil prices. Starting in 2003 and more pronounced last year, we experienced a movement in the opposite direction, when unexpectedly high levels of oil demand from China contributed to putting significant upward pressure on international prices. Therefore the challenge of smoothly and reliably meeting the region’s steadily rising energy requirement must not be under-estimated, and must be catered for at all times.

OPEC demonstrated last year how quickly and effectively it can respond to unexpected and sometimes very sudden changes in the market’s behaviour and performance. Our Conference of Oil Ministers met on five occasions during the course of 2004 — three Extraordinary Meetings, in addition to the two regular half-yearly ones — to review the current state of the market and to adjust our production target accordingly, in order to alleviate conditions that were already volatile and extreme, or were threatening to become so in the near future.

[Slide 2] Two thousand and four was indeed an unusual, if not unique, year for the oil market. It followed four years of relative stability, much of which was due to the successful operation of OPEC’s price band of US $22–28 a barrel. Prices rose steeply in 2004, so much so that the OPEC Reference Basket price hit a record high of $46.6/b in mid-October; at the same time, West Texas Intermediate rose above $56/b, also a record. This was all a result of an exceptional combination of factors.

[Slide 3] To begin with, there were higher-than-expected levels of oil demand growth, particularly in China and the United States of America; these, in turn, reflected strong growth patterns in the world economy, where estimates for the year were being repeatedly revised up. The latest estimate of 5.0 per cent compares with the forecast of 4.1 per cent made in December 2003 and is the highest annual rate since 1976. [Slide 4] China alone accounted for almost a quarter of the rise in world GDP in 2004. [Slide 5] If we look at the developing countries separately, excluding China, we see that Asia accounted for just over a half this large area’s annual increase in GDP, and India, separately, one-fifth.

[Slide 6] China has recently become the world’s second-largest oil consumer, with remarkably high rates of demand growth over the past decade.

[Slide 7] Other exceptional pressures on the international oil price in 2004 were: refining and distribution industry bottlenecks; natural and man-made temporary supply disruptions; and geopolitical tensions. Compounding the situation was heavy speculation in futures markets. But the remarkable thing was that all this happened during a year when the market always remained well-supplied with crude; indeed, there was never any occasion when there was a shortage!

OPEC’s series of Conferences saw us increase our official production target by a total of 3.5 million barrels a day, resulting in an average rise of more than 2 mb/d from the year before. This contributed significantly to the subsequent easing of oil prices, with the Basket being close to a more moderate $35/b for much of December. At the same time, commercial OECD stocks built to around their five-year average. [Slide 8] Moreover, after OPEC’s spare capacity dipped to around five per cent, some of our Member Countries sped up the implementation of their capacity expansion plans, so as to enhance the Organization’s ability to cope with possible future supply disruptions. [Slide 9] OPEC’s spare capacity now stands at more than 2 mb/d, or eight per cent, and is expected to exceed 3 mb/d by year-end.

[Slide 10] However, at the beginning of this year, prices resumed their increase, with the Basket climbing past $40/b by the second week of January; it dropped below this level a little later, before rising above it again, and it is now approaching last October’s high levels. The rise has been due mainly to the expected seasonal increase in demand in the first quarter, but there have also been supply concerns, following disruptions in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Iraq. Nevertheless, global oil supply — particularly OPEC output — remains adequate to meet expected demand.

After careful consideration at our most recent meeting in Vienna, on 30 January, we temporarily suspended the OPEC price band, because the recent market developments had resulted in price levels that had rendered the limits of the band — $22–28/b — unrealistic and ready for re-evaluation, and this is now underway.

When our Conference next meets, in the Islamic Republic of Iran in two weeks’ time, we shall review the prevailing market outlook, to see how it matches up to expectations for the second quarter of the year, when demand traditionally declines. In the meantime, OPEC will continue to closely monitor market developments.

Two questions are often being asked at the present time.

[Slide 11] The first is: “Are high oil prices here to stay?” The extent to which the changes in the oil market have been of a transient or cyclical nature, or whether, in fact, they will be more lasting, is unclear at the present time.

With regard to the near-term future, one key focus of attention concerns the prospects for future economic growth and hence oil demand growth. The cyclical nature of economic activity suggests that the current exceptional rates of economic growth cannot continue indefinitely. There is increasing concern over growing imbalances, especially in the light of the large twin deficits of the United States of America, with the potential associated risks to financial stability and world economic growth.

Here in Asia, the spotlight is on both China and India, due to their high levels of growth in 2004.

[Slide 12] In China, the authorities’ efforts to slow the economy over the past nine months have had some success, although the slowdown in industrial activity has been moderate so far; however, fiscal and monetary policies are expected to tighten in 2005. Early forecasts see a halving of the rate of oil demand growth, although this will be from an extremely high average level of 17 per cent in 2004 to a still-high level of nearly eight per cent this year.

In India, GDP growth is forecast to rise slightly to 6.5 per cent in 2005, compared with a provisional estimate of 6.0 per cent last year. Like many other countries in the region, India suffered heavily from the tsunami, but the effect of this on the country’s overall GDP is likely to be minor, according to initial reports. Conversely, one must observe that the Japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade, although there is optimism about the country’s prospects later in the year.

In the oil sector, the new requirement to adopt stricter product specifications in Asia, in addition to those already in force in Europe and the USA, could again focus price pressure on light sweet crudes, possibly triggering a substantial widening of the spread between sour and sweet grades, as was seen in the international market in the second half of 2004. As OPEC seeks to maintain oil market stability during the course of this year, the potential for such a development arising would need to be taken into consideration.

These issues come on top of the continuing uncertainty over the duration and intensity of some of the other destabilising factors that had such a negative impact on the market last year, and to which I referred earlier.

[Slide 13] However, I think it is important, at this point, to put the present price levels in their proper historical context. Today’s prices, although high in nominal terms — and record-breaking last autumn — are less than half the levels witnessed 20 years ago, in real terms. This is when we take into account inflation and exchange rate movements. In other words, the average nominal price of around $36/b for the Reference Basket last year would, in real terms, correspond to a price of $80/b in 1982. This is in spite of the fact that oil demand is now much higher and the world — that is, the richer part — much wealthier! [Slide 14] Another way of looking at this is to examine the impact of inflation and exchange rate changes on the now-suspended price band, and this shows, by the end of 2004, the upper band exceeding $36/b.

[Slide 15] Now, this is very important when we address the second of the two questions: “How will high oil prices affect world economic growth?”. Intuitively, with real prices being so much lower now, we are already in a much more favourable position, in this respect, than we were about a quarter of a century ago. But the realities cut deeper than this.

Indeed, if there is one lesson we have learned from the exceptional oil market conditions of 2004, it is that the world economy has become less sensitive to oil price increases than it was two or three decades ago. The strong growth of the global economy last year, in the face of rising oil prices, clearly supports this statement.

A very important aspect here is oil intensity — that is, the amount of oil that is required for a pre-defined unit of real growth in GDP. Across the world at large, this has fallen by around 50 per cent since 1970. More precisely, our figures show that, on average in 1970, 1.20 barrels of oil were required for an increase in world GDP of US $1,000, using purchasing power parity and 1995 as the base year for GDP. This compares with exactly half this figure — 0.60 barrels — in 2003. Indeed, the figure has been falling steadily since the mid-1970s. Thus the world is decreasingly dependant on oil for its incremental economic growth.

The reasons for this fall in oil intensity relate to such factors as leaps in technology, improvements in efficiency, government policies and changing consumer behaviour, especially as advanced societies progress from an industrial base to a service sector base. Of course, the situation is somewhat different for those societies that are at an early stage of economic development and are moving from agriculture to industry — but even they can benefit, in the process, from the huge advances that have been made in technology and efficiency in recent decades.

How do the analysts see the situation?

While studies in the 1970s suggested that a ten per cent rise in the oil price would reduce economic growth in industrialised countries by 0.2–0.8 per cent, with many estimates clustered around 0.5 per cent, the equivalent percentage impact on economic growth is now widely considered to be about 0.2 per cent. More specifically, it is felt that the $6/b increase in the quarterly average Basket price that has occurred since the second quarter of 2004 might reduce the growth rate of the world economy in 2005 by about 0.3 per cent. Nonetheless, we should not be — and, indeed, we are not — complacent about the potential for higher prices in the future to affect economic growth.

OPEC’s awareness of these issues goes hand-in-hand with its appreciation of other underlying realities that affect day-to-day operations in the oil market, as well as the market’s ability to meet the challenges that it will face in the future.

The actions we took in the difficult conditions last year demonstrated once again our longstanding commitment to ensuring oil market stability, to the benefit of producers and consumers alike. Secure supply, reasonable prices and fair returns to investors have all been central objectives of our Organization, since it was founded in Baghdad nearly 45 years ago.

OPEC cannot act alone, of course. We require support from other major parties in the market and industry — non-OPEC producers, the international oil companies, financial institutions and, in a generic sense, consumers. When such support has been forthcoming — and there have been welcome big advances in this area since the mid-1980s — it has added significant bite to our market-stabilisation measures.

Such support, however, should not be limited to crisis management. Everyone — or nearly everyone! — will rally round in a crisis, when there is excessive volatility or prices are extremely high or extremely low. But it is equally important to maintain this unified stance on sunny days too! Throughout its history — and this is probably due to the central role oil plays in the day-to-day lives of people in the dominant consumer nations of the world — the oil market has been inherently volatile in nature. It can get out of line very quickly, if left to its own devices. Sunny days can quickly become stormy days! And this is detrimental to both consumers and producers. Therefore it is necessary for all responsible parties to maintain constant vigilance, and be prepared to act, as and when necessary, if they want to maximise the sunny days. Indeed, timely, collective, preventive measures, taken when the first dark clouds appear on the horizon, can work wonders.

Here I am referring to more than just the near term. In OPEC, we are also deeply committed to the industry’s future welfare. Let us, therefore, look at the reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model, to see how the situation may develop in the oil market in the first quarter of the 21st century.

[Slide 16] Our projections are based on an average annual world economic growth rate of 3.5 per cent for the period up to 2025. The forecast rate of almost 5.0 per cent for the developing countries will be double the OECD’s projected 2.4 per cent.

[Slide 17] In line with this, global oil demand will rise by 28 million barrels a day to 111 mb/d by 2025 — an annual average growth rate of 1.5 mb/d. OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of world oil demand. [Slide 18] However, four-fifths of the increase in demand over the next 20 years will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth.

[Slide 19] The transportation sector will account for almost 60 per cent of the rise in global oil demand over the next two decades. This will amount to nearly all the growth in the transition economies, more than four-fifths in the OECD and close to half in the developing countries, [Slide 20] given that vehicle intensities are lower by more than the order of magnitude.

Turning to supply, let me start by saying that the world can rest assured that there should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. The world’s oil resource base should not be seen as a constraint, in meeting future demand.

[Slide 21] Our projections for the period up to 2025 show that overall non-OPEC output will continue to increase, but more slowly, reaching a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. This represents a rise of 5–7 mb/d from 2004, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty. The key sources for the increase in non-OPEC supply will be Russia, the Caspian, Latin America and Africa.

[Slide 22] If we look at the oil market forecasts for Asia specifically for the next decade and a half, we see a substantial increase in the continent’s net oil import requirement [Slide 23], since, while oil demand growth will gallop along at an average annual rate of 2.7 per cent, the situation for supply will be minimal, at 0.6 per cent. Asia’s net oil import requirement will, in fact, grow at an annual average rate of 0.71 mb/d across the region, according to this scenario. For China, the average annual rate of oil demand growth will be one percentage point higher than that of Asia as a whole, 3.7 per cent.

World electricity demand — the main focus of this conference — with its very strong link to economic growth, will continue to display higher rates of growth than total energy demand, attributing much of the increment to developing countries. While annual electricity demand growth in developing countries as a whole is forecast to average around 4.6–5.1 per cent during the next two decades, the Asian economies are expected to have the highest rates.

[Slide 24] Oil, in absolute terms, is forecast to retain its modest contribution to global electricity generation, at around 6 mb/d, but with a gradual decline in its share from eight per cent to around five per cent in 2020.

[Slide 25] Nevertheless, oil does play a significant role at peak load times or when there is an unexpectedly strong demand surge, as we have been witnessing in China recently, with the jumps in diesel demand of around 300,000 b/d and 500,000 b/d in the last two years.

Thus, in the light of all this and returning to the global outlook, OPEC will be called upon increasingly to supply the incremental barrel. OPEC has both the capability and the will to do this. Around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves are located in OPEC’s Member Countries. Moreover, these reserves, which are mostly on land, are more accessible and cheaper to exploit than those in non-OPEC areas. In 2025, the reference case sees OPEC meeting almost half the world’s oil demand, at 49 per cent, with 55 mb/d.

[Slide 26] To provide the required production capacity in a timely and sufficient manner will involve the use of sound investment strategies. Investment is needed: to meet the forecast absolute increase in demand; to replace natural declines in production; and to ensure that oil producers always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply. Also, the oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before, and this will aided by continued steady advances in technology.

[Slide 27] The required global investment will be large, although it will not necessarily be different in magnitude to that observed in the past. Moreover, the cost of investment in OPEC oil is much lower than in non-OPEC oil, yielding more than a fourfold multiple, in terms of new production capacity for the same level of investment.

[Slide 28] However, when we look at the future, we find ourselves facing a wall of uncertainty, making it very difficult to produce meaningful forecasts that will help us with our investment plans, even for the short and medium terms. This is partly due to the wide range of feasible demand growth scenarios, but it is also reinforced by contrasting views on the potential evolution of non-OPEC production, as well as future costs. Uncertainties over future economic growth, government policies and the rate of development and diffusion of newer technologies are among the main factors that lie behind this.

Let us not forget that over-investment may result in excessive, costly, idle capacity, leading to downward pressure on prices, while under-investment may result in a shortage of crude and higher prices. In both cases, the losses, especially for producing countries, and the possible, broader associated damage, such as to the world economy, can be significant.

[Slide 29] To illustrate just how significant uncertainties can be to investment plans, if we return to our scenarios and reduce our global economic growth projections by just one percentage point, we will find that this will lower the investment requirement for 2010 from a reference case $95 bn to $70 bn — which is a big difference. In 2025, the gap will be a massive $124 bn.

Now it is impossible, of course, to predict at this stage whether the eventual outcome will be closer to our reference case scenario than to a low- or high-economic-growth scenario. But we do believe that, if there is a variance, it is more likely to be on the downside, rather than the upside. This would then have a serious impact on the revenue expectations of our Member Countries in the years ahead, adversely affecting their development and investment plans.

All of this places a premium on consistency, transparency and certainty within the international oil community — as well as a broad-based, equitable approach — when it comes to planning for the future and doing so in a manner that is in harmony with the requirements of the global economy.

[Slide 30] The industry, therefore, is much better-off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of handling the major issues of mutual concern — such as price stability, security of demand and supply, investment, environmental issues and sustainable development.

This is why we welcome and encourage the big advances in producer/consumer dialogue and cooperation that have occurred across the industry in recent years, with much of the impetus coming from Asia.

Less than two months ago, the first Round Table of Asian Oil and Gas Ministers was held in New Delhi, under the umbrella of the International Energy Forum Secretariat. [Slide 31] This constituted an important step forward in dialogue in the fastest-growing region of the global economy. The meeting concluding that cooperation between Asian producers and consumers was crucial to ensuring stability, security and sustainability through mutual interdependence in the region’s oil and gas economy.

The Forum itself has been highly successful over the past dozen or so years as an inspiration for, and organiser of, producer/consumer dialogue, and its permanent Secretariat is now set up in an Asian country, Saudi Arabia, which is a Member of OPEC. We also engage in annual dialogue with high-level energy officials and research institutes from China, Japan and South Korea, while the most recent in a series of joint meetings among OPEC and non-OPEC producers was held in Oman last October. Another notable development in this direction is the agreement to launch, as of this year, a formal EU-OPEC dialogue on a biannual basis, to further constructive cooperation on energy-related issues.

OPEC welcomes all these developments, as being indicative of a strengthening within Asia of the process of dialogue and cooperation, that is so important for the continuing healthy evolution of the oil industry in the early 21st century. Coming from deep within the heart of the fastest-growing economic region of the world, this inspires all of us with confidence about the future of the industry.

[Slide 32] Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/342-1-march-2005.html"
"2005-02-16","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking His Excellency Dr Chakib Khelil, the Minister of Mines and Energy for Algeria, for this invitation to participate in the Second African Petroleum Congress. I should like to extend to His Excellency the greetings of the President of the OPEC Conference and Secretary General, His Excellency Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah. His Excellency Sheikh Al-Sabah has instructed me to address the Congress on his behalf.

Let me now say a few words about the current market situation, due to its present importance.

We have just experienced an unusual — if not unique — year for the oil market. [Slide 2] Following four years of relative stability within the OPEC price band, now suspended, we saw a rapid rise in crude oil prices, as a result of an exceptional combination of factors — in particular: the demand surge in Asia and the United States; refining and distribution industry bottlenecks; natural and man-made temporary supply disruptions; and geopolitical tensions. All of this was compounded by speculation in the futures market. In mid-October, the OPEC Reference Basket price hit a record high of US $46.6 per barrel. All this happened in spite of the fact that the market always remained well-supplied with crude; indeed, there was never any occasion when there was a shortage.

In response to the increases in demand, the OPEC Conference met on no less than five occasions in 2004 — including once in this beautiful city of Algiers — and increased its official production ceiling by a total of 3.5 million barrels a day during the course of the year, resulting in an average rise of more than 2 mb/d from the year before. This contributed significantly to the subsequent easing of oil prices, with the Basket remaining close to $35/b for much of December, and allowed commercial OECD stocks to build to around their five-year average. Furthermore, some of our Member Countries sped up the implementation of their capacity expansion plans, so as to enhance further the Organization’s ability to cope with possible future supply disruptions. OPEC spare capacity now stands at more than two million barrels a day and is expected to reach more than 3 mb/d by year-end.

However, at the beginning of this year, prices resumed their increase, with the Basket climbing past $40/b by the second week of January, although they have since slipped back below this level. The rise has been due mainly to seasonal characteristics, such as the expected shift towards colder weather in the Northern Hemisphere, which is leading to increased demand in the first quarter, amid supply concerns, following disruptions in the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and Iraq. Nevertheless, global oil supply — particularly OPEC output — remains adequate to meet expected demand.

At our most recent meeting in Vienna, we decided to maintain our present agreed production levels. At the same time, we temporarily suspended the OPEC price band, because the recent market developments resulted in price levels that rendered the limits of the band unrealistic and ready for re-evaluation, which is now underway.

When our Conference next meets, in the Islamic Republic of Iran on 16 March, we shall review the prevailing market outlook, to see how it matches up with expectations for the second quarter of the year, when demand traditionally declines. In the meantime, OPEC will continue to closely monitor market developments.

Let us now look further into the future, in accordance with the long-term orientation of this session. We shall use the reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model, “OWEM”, to see how the situation may develop in the oil market in the first quarter of the 21st century.

[Slide 3] Our projections are based on an average annual world economic growth rate of 3.5 per cent for the period up to 2025. The forecast rate of almost 5.0 per cent for the developing countries will be double the OECD’s projected 2.4 per cent.

[Slide 4] In line with this, global oil demand will rise by 28 million barrels a day to 111 mb/d by 2025 — an annual average growth rate of 1.5 per cent. OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of world oil demand.

[Slide 5] However, four-fifths of the increase in demand over the next 20 years will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth.

[Slide 6] The transportation sector will account for almost 60 per cent of the rise in global oil demand over the next two decades. This will amount to nearly all the growth in the transition economies, more than four-fifths in the OECD and close to half in the developing countries.

Turning to supply, let me start by saying that the world can rest assured that there should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. The world’s oil resource base should not be seen as a constraint, in meeting future demand.

[Slide 7] Our projections for the period up to 2025 show that overall non-OPEC output will continue to increase, but more slowly, reaching a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. This represents a rise of 5–7 mb/d from 2004, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty. The key sources for the increase in non-OPEC supply will be Russia, the Caspian, Latin America and Africa.

OPEC will increasingly be called upon to supply the incremental barrel. [Slide 8] OPEC has both the capability and the will to do this. Around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves are located in OPEC’s Member Countries. Moreover, these reserves are more accessible and cheaper to exploit than those in non-OPEC areas. In 2025, the reference case sees OPEC meeting almost half the world’s oil demand, at 49 per cent, with 55 mb/d.

One of the basic challenges facing OPEC — and other oil producers too — is to ensure that sufficient, but not excessive, production capacity will be available at all times to help meet the forecast rise in oil demand.

[Slide 9] This will involve the use of sound investment strategies. Investment is needed: to meet the forecast absolute increase in demand; to replace natural declines in production; and to ensure that oil producers always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply. Also, the oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before, and this will aided by continued steady advances in technology. [Slide 10] The required global investment will be large, although it will not necessarily be different in magnitude to that observed in the past. Also, the cost of investment in OPEC oil is much lower than in non-OPEC oil, yielding more than a fourfold multiple, in terms of new production capacity for the same level of investment.

These are all big challenges facing the oil industry. Can it cope?

The industry has experienced radical change since the early 1990s. [Slide 11] The spate of mergers and acquisitions — at all levels — has sharpened the industry’s competitive edge, through enhanced efficiency and cost-cutting measures. There has been a comprehensive repositioning of the industry, with better financial capabilities and continued advances in technology. Oil companies have, in general, broadened their base, evolving into corporate energy units.

How does all of this affect OPEC’s Member Countries? In such an evolving landscape, our national oil companies must increasingly face new challenges and opportunities. At the same time, our Governments and Petroleum Ministries will continue to adapt to these new realities.

The way in which our Member Countries respond to this varies, in accordance with their individual economic, social and political dynamics and values, while, at the same time, they seek to adhere to OPEC’s objectives and decisions as best they can. This can prove to be a delicate balancing act.

[slide 12] The economic fortunes of OPEC’s Member Countries have been heavily dependant upon their oil revenues since at least the establishment of the Organization in 1960, or their joining it in the following decade or so. Oil revenues, indeed, have accounted for a sizeable proportion of OPEC’s collective GDP over the years, although the degree of this has fluctuated in accordance with the prevailing oil market conditions. There are, naturally, big differences among the Member Countries.

If we look at the situation in terms of oil export revenue as a proportion of total export revenue [slide13], we find that, for the Organization as a whole, this averaged 68 per cent in 2003, with a wide spread for individual Member Countries, from just 16 per cent for Indonesia to as much as 95 per cent for the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. Iraq — at 99 per cent — is understandably a special case at the present time.

The receipt of steady, reasonable levels of revenue offers significant potential benefits for these countries. The challenge has been — and remains — to use the oil revenues, or rent, to develop and diversify their economies through investment in physical and social infrastructure, as well as growth in the non-oil sector. In other words, it is to diversify their economies and prepare for a smooth transition to sustainable development for the post-oil era, whenever that occurs in each individual case.

On top of this, there are potential advantages at a broader, international economic level, whereby the petroleum revenues can contribute towards providing the funds required for investment in future oil production capacity, to enable secure, stable supplies for consumers in the years ahead. Indeed, there is an obvious symmetry here, because an orderly market will in itself result in future sound revenue viability.

The potential gains extend even further than this, however, as the record of the highly successful OPEC Fund for International Development will attest; since its establishment in 1976 as a specialist aid agency for developing countries, the Fund has made commitments totalling nearly US $7.5 billion, two-thirds of which has already been disbursed.

Well, as we all know, with regard to domestic development policies and oil market investment, the actual performance fell well short of expectations for much of our Membership in the 1970s and early 1980s — for already well-documented reasons that lie beyond the scope of this address and relate to events that occurred in an era of wide-ranging economic and political readjustment in the international community at large.

But we all learned important lessons from those experiences. Essentially — and in accordance with each country’s domestic policies and philosophies — they revolve around the need to make our economies more competitive and outward-looking, to allow for more private sector participation and investment, and to develop domestic financial markets. The current economic structures and macroeconomic policies in our Member Countries are, by and large, conducive to sustainable economic growth and allow for the more efficient use of their oil resources.

From a market perspective, we have become aware of the central importance of order and stability and the need to manage volatility and extreme price levels, both high and low. Volatility and extremities are damaging to all parties. OPEC knows this well, from, among other things, the personal experiences of its own Member Countries. We only have to examine the GDP/ capita movements over the past 35 years to see that [slide 14]. After an initial steep rise in the early 1970s, there was a near-similar decline in the 1980s, so much so that, by the end of the 1980s, GDP/capita was not much higher, in real terms, than it had been two decades earlier. While, in absolute terms across our Organization, GDP may have grown by an annual average of 3.4 per cent since 1970, in per capita terms, we are looking at just one per cent growth. Even last year, real per capita/GDP was still below levels reached in the late 1970s.

High levels of volatility and uncertainty can severely prejudice plans to invest either in domestic economic and social development or in future oil production capacity, with wider ramifications for the global economy at large. We need to ensure that we put the lessons of the past to good use, so that a more orderly, predictable and equitable market environment will emerge in the future, that will help eradicate past deficiencies and lead to enhanced security and stability, both domestically and in the industry.

When we look at the future, we find ourselves facing a wall of uncertainty, making it very difficult to produce meaningful forecasts that will help us with our investment plans, even for the short and medium terms [Slide 15] This is partly due to the wide range of feasible demand growth scenarios, but it is also reinforced by contrasting views on the potential evolution of non-OPEC production, as well as future costs. Uncertainties over future economic growth, government policies and the rate of development and diffusion of newer technologies are among the main factors that lie behind this. The oil price path is also important, reinforcing the need for sustained market order and stability.

Let us not forget that over-investment may result in excessive, costly, idle capacity, leading to downward pressure on prices; while under-investment may lead to a shortage of crude and higher prices. In both cases, the losses, especially for producing countries, and the possible, broader associated damage, such as to the world economy, can be significant.

[Slide 16] To illustrate just how significant uncertainties can be to investment plans, if we return to our scenarios and reduce our global economic growth projections by just one percentage point, we will find that this will lower the investment requirement for 2010 from a reference case $95 bn to $70 bn — which is a big difference. In 2025, the gap will be a massive $124 bn.

Now it is impossible, of course, to predict at this stage whether the eventual outcome will be closer to our reference case scenario than to a low- or high-economic-growth scenario. But we do believe that, if there is a variance, it is more likely to be on the downside, rather than the upside. This would then have a serious impact on the revenue expectations of our Member Countries in the years ahead, adversely affecting their development and investment plans.

All of this places a premium on consistency, transparency and certainty within the international oil community — as well as a broad-based, equitable approach — when it comes to planning for the future and doing so in a manner that is in harmony with the requirements of the global economy.

The industry, therefore, is much better-off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of handling the major issues of mutual concern — such as price stability, security of demand and supply, investment, environmental issues and sustainable development.

This is why we welcome and encourage the big advances in producer/consumer dialogue and cooperation that have occurred across the industry in recent years, from such large-scale international ministerial gatherings as your important Second African Petroleum Congress to other bilateral or regional contacts in this continent.

I am confident that we can all rise to the challenges of the early 21st century, not only to meet the growing thirst of the established developed nations, but also to support the emerging economies of Africa, Asia and Latin America, as they set out on the path of sustainable development.

[Slide 17] Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/343-16-february-2005.html"
"2005-01-26","Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. It gives me great pleasure to be at this year’s meeting of the World Economic Forum, an event that has become one of the most important and influential gatherings on the annual calendar. I am particularly pleased, as OPEC’s Conference President, to address this important Meeting of Governors on energy and to share with you OPEC’s views on some topical issues.

The year 2004 was, without doubt, very unusual, if not unique, for the oil market. It witnessed a rapid rise in crude oil prices, as a result of an exceptional combination of factors — in particular: the unanticipated demand surge in Asia and the United States; refining and distribution industry bottlenecks; temporary supply disruptions; as well as geopolitical tensions. All of this was compounded by speculation in the futures market. In mid-October, the OPEC Reference Basket price hit a record high of US $46.6 per barrel. At the same time, WTI reached $56.4/b, nearly $10/b above the Basket price. This was in sharp contrast to the drop in oil prices in the late 1990s and the relative stability of 2000–03, following the introduction of the OPEC price band in 2000. For most of that period, the Basket price remained comfortably within the band of $22–28/b, averaging just over $25/b.

Consistent with its key objective of maintaining market stability, OPEC responded to the surge in oil demand and rapid price escalation in 2004 by increasing its official production ceiling by a total of 3.5 million barrels a day. This allowed the Basket price to fall by around 25 per cent, to about $36/b by the end of December. In addition, OPEC member countries speeded up implementation of plans to expand production capacity so that adequate spare capacity is maintained at all times; Currently, OPEC spare capacity stands at around 1.5 mbd and is expected to reach 2.5 -3.0 mbd by year end.

It is important to note that such a price, although high in nominal terms, is about 50 per cent below levels reached in the early 1980s in real terms — not to mention the reduced purchasing power of oil revenues, as a result of the depreciation in the US dollar. It should also be noted that many OPEC Members produce heavy crudes which attract much lower prices than other widely traded crude benchmarks and that of the OPEC Basket.

Notwithstanding all this, many people ask: Is the current high oil price here to stay? And how will this affect world economic growth? I should like to examine the latter question first. I believe many of you will agree that, if there is one lesson we have learned from the exceptional oil market conditions of 2004, it is that the world economy has become less sensitive to oil price increases, as a result of the structural changes seen in the last couple of decades. The strong growth of the global economy last year, in the face of rising oil prices, supports this statement. On whether high prices have come to stay, 2004 was, as I have already noted, an exceptional year. Though it is unlikely that we will see prices reverting to the very low levels of the nineties, the extent to which the changes in the oil market have been of a transient or cyclical nature — as witnessed by the $10/b price drop in the final quarter — or whether, in fact, they will be more lasting, is unclear at the present time. OPEC is studying the whole situation very carefully, keeping in mind especially the need to maintain the well-being of the global economy and long term energy security and stability as key objectives.

Despite OPEC’s persistent efforts to achieve order and stability and the fact that the market remains well-supplied, we have continued to experience high price volatility since the start of this year. This is, to some extent, a reflection of seasonal market characteristics. We foresee continued healthy economic growth in 2005. Much of this growth will come from the developing countries, particularly those in Asia, whose economies will also register higher oil demand growth. Similarly, the oil demand increase in 2005 will remain strong, but much less than in 2004. In OPEC’s reference case scenario of sustained and robust economic growth, medium-to-long-term oil demand is likely to grow at an average annual rate of 1.6 per cent, reaching around 115 mb/d by 2025.

OPEC will increasingly be called upon to supply the incremental barrel. Our Member Countries have the resources, the willingness and the capability to meet the rising demand, as they have successfully done in the past. OPEC possesses around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, but currently accounts for only about two-fifths of global output. The implication is clear. There is enough oil to service the global economy for decades to come and perhaps well into the second half of this century, if account is taken of the potential of unconventional oil, as well as likely additional conventional discoveries. For the world at large — but particularly for the emerging economies of Asia, Africa and Latin America — there is enough oil to support their growth, in the same way that this important hydrocarbon fuelled the economic growth of today’s industrialised countries in the last century.

This brings me to the issue of security of supply. Given the crucial role that oil has come to play in the lives of ordinary people, it is natural for them to be concerned about security of supply.

However, there has never been a lack of oil in the world market in recent decades, even at the most difficult of times, such as during the first and second Gulf Wars or when there have been supply disruptions from major producers. It is important to ensure that there is always sufficient capacity to meet the expected rises in demand, and this requires adequate and timely investment. While the level of this investment will be considerable, it will not be much different to that seen in the recent past — to the order of $100 billion per year. Fortunately, on a per barrel basis, much less investment will be needed in OPEC’s Member Countries than in other oil-producing countries, since OPEC oil is more abundant, more accessible and cheaper to bring to market, yielding more than a fourfold multiple in terms of new production capacity for the same investment.

Before concluding, some further remarks are appropriate regarding energy security. To begin with, it should be stressed that, just as security of supply is important to consumers, security of demand is a key concern of producers. OPEC maintains that the best strategy to ensure energy security is constructive dialogue, leading to cooperation and partnership. This has been demonstrated by the International Energy Forum, which, since the early 1990s, has served as a platform for dialogue on energy issues among consumers and producers. Most recently, under the umbrella of the IEF Secretariat, a roundtable of Asian Oil and Gas Ministers was held in New Delhi, with the aim of extending regional cooperation in the oil and gas sectors.

Such efforts show that, together, producers and consumers can give each other the mutual understanding and assurance required for the industry to achieve sustained growth and stability. Market order and stability is a shared responsibility for all parties. It remains imperative that all players associated with the industry — producers, consumers, governments, oil companies and financial institutions — join hands in cooperation.

As OPEC President, I can assure you that OPEC is committed to meeting its responsibility to the market to the full, just as it has always done.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/344-26-january-2005.html"
"2005-01-06","Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It gives me great pleasure to extend to you the greetings of HE Sheikh Ahmad Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, Kuwait’s Energy Minister, and President of the OPEC Conference, and to thank the organizers for inviting OPEC to participate in this timely and important high-level roundtable discussion on ‘Regional Cooperation: Key to Energy Security.’ I speak on behalf of the President and all OPEC Member Countries in expressing our deepest sorrow and great sadness over the catastrophic earthquake and tidal waves that recently devastated parts of the Asian region, including India. No words can adequately describe the extent of this unprecedented disaster. OPEC Members have been quick to join the international effort to help the countries involved in the relief and recovery efforts, but the sheer scope of the damage inflicted on these areas could take many years to put right.

MARKET STABILITY & OPEC ROLE

(Slide 2) As we venture into 2005, we leave behind us one of the busiest and most eventful years in the history of the oil market, a period which saw crude oil prices soar to record levels. Prior to 2004, following the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, the introduction of the OPEC Price Band in 2000 ensured the maintenance of relative stability in the international oil market for 4 years (2000 to 20003). During this period, the price of the OPEC Reference Basket of seven crudes remained comfortably within the range of our price band of 22-28 dollar a barrel.

However, 2004 saw unusual developments on many fronts in the marketplace, in particular the unanticipated demand surge in Asia and the United States, accompanied by geopolitical tensions, refining and distribution bottlenecks, which were exacerbated by the effects of the hurricanes seen in the Americas, and compounded by speculation in the futures markets. Together, these factors pushed prices to record levels in nominal terms, although they were still well below the highs of the early 1980s in real terms (by about 50 per cent).

Consistent with its objectives and the leading role it has always played to stabilize the market, OPEC responded by increasing production to near capacity levels last year. (Slide 3) The official OPEC output ceiling, excluding Iraq, was increased three times during the year - by a total of 3.5 million b/d [- to 27 million b/d.] Actual OPEC production reached around 30 million b/d in the third and fourth quarters, resulting in well over 1 million b/d of excess supply for most of the year. OPEC’s actions, in addition, sent a powerful psychological signal that the Organization was doing all in its power to ensure that markets remained well supplied. Once concerns about OPEC’s production capability dissipated, prices started to fall considerably, and today they are converging more in line with the fundamentals of the market, with OECD stock levels back to normal. [It was against this backdrop that OPEC, at its last Meeting in Cairo in December, felt there was a need to trim-down the one million b/d of overproduction from the market to prevent prices from falling too steeply in the run-up to the second quarter of 2005, when demand traditionally falls significantly.] Today, the price of the OPEC Reference Basket is around the 36 dollar a barrel mark, the average for 2004 [vs. $28.1 average in 2003], and some 30 per cent lower than the highs observed in October last year. At the same time, OPEC Member Countries have speeded up plans designed to boost their spare production capacity to over 2.5 million b/d this year, from the current 1.5 million b/d.

Looking at the outlook for oil in 2005, we foresee a continued and healthy global economic growth rate of 4.1 percent, compared with 4.9 percent in 2004. [Growth will be much faster in developing countries than in the OECD — 5 percent compared with 2.8 percent — while, separately, China is projected to experience 7.6 percent growth. Of the European countries, Russia will see 6 percent growth.] Consequently, the oil demand growth forecast for 2005 stands at 1.6 million b/d. Asia is expected to account for a significant proportion of this growth. OPEC Members will be expected to supply an average of around 28.2 million b/d of oil this year (similar to 2004.)

LONG-TERM OUTLOOK

Even though global economies are now much more resilient in their ability to absorb the affects of exceptional price movements, producers must endeavour to ensure that adequate and reliable supplies continue to be available in the future at reasonable prices, to meet the growth in demand - especially if the developing countries are to benefit fully from this valuable energy resource, just as the developed countries did in the 20th century. There is a convergence of views that the world’s petroleum resources, with world’s current proven crude oil reserves placed at around 1,100 billion barrels, are still plentiful and will be sufficient to meet demand over many decades to come. Based on our figures, using the reference case from the OPEC World Energy Model (OWEM) (Slide 4) global oil demand is set to rise by 33 million b/d to 115 million b/d by 2025. That represents an annual average growth of 1.6 million b/d, or 1.7 percent, over the next 20 years. [This is based on a global economic growth forecast of 3.6 percent annually up to 2020.]

(Slide 5) While OECD countries will continue to account for the lion’s share of world oil, almost three-quarters of the marginal increase in global demand will come from the developing world. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand in the developing states. With this region containing over 50 per cent of the global population, it has emerged as a key player in global markets for commodities, manufacturing and services. (Slide 6) Again, our figures show that up to 2025 the region is expected to account for a rise of 18 million b/d in oil demand, which represents 65 percent of the total in all developing states. (Slide 7) India, along with China, is central to this growth, with the boom in the transportation sector a particularly important factor. (Slide 8) The huge potential for growth is clear from the low density of vehicles in these two countries, which stands at just over 10 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, compared with over 500 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants in the OECD region. Of course, we are fully cognisant of the fact that many factors may constrain the rise in oil demand in the future, but the region is moving at such a pace that one cannot fail to recognise the huge potential it offers.

OPEC will increasingly be called upon to supply the incremental barrel. Its Member Countries, in particular those in the West Asia, have the willingness, the resources, and the capabilities to meet the increasing demand. As they have done so in the past. (Slide 9) OPEC possesses around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves, but currently only accounts for only about two-fifths of global output. (Slide 10) In 2025, we project that our Members will be meeting more than half the world’s oil demand, with total production of over 58 million b/d.

In tandem with the oil growth comes gas, which OPEC Member Countries also have in abundance. Again, looking at our estimates, they show that world gas demand will expand by an average of around 3 percent a year up to 2025. That spells good news for our Members, who together possess [over 88.7 trillion standard cubic metres of proven gas reserves,] almost 50 per cent of the global total. And when one considers that their total marketed output today accounts for just 16 percent of the global figure, the room for future development is considerable.

INVESTMENT:

Naturally, one of the primary objectives of OPEC – and for that matter all oil producers - is to ensure that sufficient production capacity is available at all times to meet the forecast rise in oil demand in the coming years. (Slide 11) Investment is needed to meet the increase in demand; to replace exhausted reserves; and to make sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected surges in demand, or shortages in supply. And just as consumers need security of supply, so do producers require security of demand. The required investment for boosting capacity will be considerable, although not much different than that seen in the recent past – of the order of 100 billion dollars a year. However, it will be much less in OPEC Member Countries than in other producing states, since OPEC oil is more accessible and cheaper to bring to market, yielding more than 4-fold multiple in terms of new productions capacity for same investment. Nonetheless, the exact magnitude of the required capital injection is subject to large uncertainty, due to uncertainty over future economic growth and a number of other factors, including the extent of the industry’s technological development and polices of consuming countries. Over-investment may result in excessive, costly idle capacity, while under-investment may lead to a shortage of crude. Both inevitably, lead to undesirable boom-bust cycles.

CO-OPERATION:

So what of the future for OPEC? Well, the kind of developments we have been witnessing, in the last year especially, again demonstrate the need for concerted cooperation and coordination in our industry. (Slide 12) Only by working together can we ensure that the global oil market is stable, and operates with prices that are fair to both producers and consumers, especially the energy-exporting and energy-importing developing countries in Asia. It remains imperative that all players associated with the industry – producers, consumers, governments, oil companies, and financial institutions - join hands in cooperation. Market order and stability is a shared responsibility for all parties. Advances in dialogue and cooperation among the producers, and the producers and the consumers, have been an encouraging feature of the past couple of decades - from large-scale international ministerial gatherings, such as the meetings of the now-institutionalised International Energy Forum, to bilateral or regional contacts that extend across national boundaries. Indeed, the establishment of the Forum’s Secretariat in an OPEC Member Country - Saudi Arabia - bears witness to the Organization’s commitment to this cause. Relations between OPEC and several leading non-OPEC producers have been enhanced and strengthened. In addition to active dialogue and exchanges at OPEC Ministerial Conferences, we are now involved in a series of high level technical exchanges among OPEC and non-OPEC producers. Recent years have also witnessed the development of a closer working relationship between OPEC and the International Energy Agency, to exchange ideas and information and we collaborate with IEA and other international organization in one of the most important collaborative projects to promote the compilation and dissemination of more timely and reliable data on global oil market. All this is indeed a step in the right direction, since there is little doubt that the industry is much better off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of addressing issues that concern all parties.

Excellencies,

Today, the global economy is clearly less sensitive to oil price shocks, compared with the situation seen in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet, the fact remains that an oil market that is stable, with a fair and equitable price, is still the best way forward for attaining global economic prosperity - something OPEC has been professing for many years. And with demand for oil and gas set to increase markedly in the years ahead, there is now an ever-greater need to achieve — and sustain — lasting market order. OPEC has the proven ability to be innovative and constructive in the policies and decisions it takes. The world has recently come to appreciate the benefit of OPEC’s spare production capacity in providing sufficient supplies in times of need. It is now understood just how valuable the investments OPEC Member Countries have made in developing their spare capacities are to the planet’s future welfare. Also recognized and appreciated in contributing to oil market stability is the price band concept introduced by OPEC in 2000.

Today, Globalisation and technological progress have turned our world into a small village, characterized by an increasing interdependence between nations. Our futures are intertwined and we therefore share common destinies. This interdependence is seen as a powerful requisite for establishing lasting security and stability. Dialogue, exchange of views, and understanding, are required for attaining this goal in the future.

CONCLUSION:

Excellencies,

Let me conclude with the following observations:

1. There is a convergence of views that Asia will become more and more important for the petroleum industry in the years ahead, both in terms of supply and demand. Oil trade in this region will increase dramatically in the future.

2. This growth scenario for Asia brings with it tremendous potential and opportunities for development and cooperation.

3. There will be room for increased investment, both in upstream and downstream activities, as well as opportunities for bilateral and possibly multilateral transactions, involving the transit countries, and covering such areas as joint storage farms, refineries, petrochemical installations, and distribution systems, to name just a few. Crossed investments (upstream versus downstream) are a real possibility.

4. Cooperation in Technology Research and Development is also path to be explored, both in upstream and downstream sectors, and in the pursuit of cleaner and more environmentally-sound fossil fuel technologies.

5. Public and private partnerships among Asian countries should be facilitated through the creation of a better framework and improved conditions for enabling increased investment and trade.

6. There is an ever-increasing importance attached to regular dialogue between West Asia oil producers and Asian countries to promote stable and secure energy markets and achieve sustainable development; consideration should be given to convening meetings similar to this one periodically.

7. Concerted cooperation and coordination among all players in the industry are essential for achieving lasting oil market stability.

Much has been achieved over the years, but the learning curve never ends. We can and must benefit from our past experiences and from enhanced dialogue exchanges to analyse the key issues. I believe we are now better prepared than ever to meet the future challenges. If a united front can be established, then we all stand to benefit - and the industry will go from strength to strength, to the benefit of all parties. Oil has played a key role in fuelling the development of the industrialized countries in the 20th century – it should now play just as important a role in supporting the future growth of the economies of the developing world.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/345-6-january-2005.html"
"2004-12-02","H.E Vincent S. Perez, Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

It is a great honour to be invited to deliver this address to the Makati Business Forum, on OPEC, its policies and their impact in Asia.

Indeed, it is always a pleasure to address audiences close to home, and one cannot be much closer to home than being with one’s neighbours! As tropical countries consisting of large numbers of islands in what has been a high-growth region of the world in recent decades, with the notable exception of the 1997/98 Asian financial crash, Indonesia and the Philippines share many things in common. However, there is a marked difference with regard to their energy profiles. While Indonesia has, for a long time, been a net exporter of crude oil — up to very recently, at least — and is also the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, the Philippines has been a net energy importer.

It is with genuine concern that I address you at what is undoubtedly a difficult time for the government and people of the Philippines, as a result of the persistent high international oil prices, the effects of which are now being felt in some quarters. The recent transport protests against the hike in domestic fuel product prices are at one regrettable, yet some would say understandable. When the ordinary man in the street begins to suffer hardship, as a result of factors completely beyond his control, this kind of response can happen. The Philippines only accounts for 0.3 percent of global oil demand, but with the country just producing some 25,000 b/d of its own crude, and having to import most of its oil - running at around 300,000 b/d – I am afraid it is precariously exposed to the full adverse impact of any substantial rise in the price of international crude. I speak on behalf of all OPEC Member Countries when I say that we have every sympathy for you in your dilemma, especially since no one can be apportioned blame for such a situation occurring. The reality is that a combination of factors is responsible for the sustained increase in crude prices, and even though in successive OPEC Meetings our Ministers have tried, and had some moderate success, in cooling the overheated market, prices have remained somewhat higher than in recent years – in particular for light sweet crudes. In this type of scenario, there will, unfortunately, always be some hardship. That has been reflected in the economic projections for the Philippines, where inflation has climbed from 4.2 percent in May, to 5.4 percent in June, and 7.7 percent in October, more than double the 2003 level of 3.5 percent.

But I have to emphasise that the kind of development we are seeing in the Philippines today again demonstrates the need for us to ensure that the global oil market is not only stable, but operates with prices that are fair to both producers and consumers, and especially those countries who rely heavily on our imports. We have been professing this for many years and a few years ago we identified that “fair” price level to be in the range of 22-28 dollars a barrel. Before this latest price surge, we had been very successful in keeping the price within that target. Turning to our only Member Country in this region, Indonesia’s presence in the international oil market has been enhanced by its membership of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which it joined in 1962, two years after the group’s establishment. Throughout this time, as a keen and active Member, we have lived through many ups and downs in the international oil market, collectively asserting the sovereign rights of producing nations to determine the destiny of their indigenous hydrocarbons resources, as recognised by the United Nations charter. As the only OPEC Member from this part of the world, we consider ourselves to be in a special position to articulate the attitudes and concerns of this region in OPEC circles, and vice-versa.

With Asia containing over 50 per cent of the global population – my own country is the world’s fourth most populous nation - the region has shown itself to be a key player in global markets for commodities, manufacturing and services. There is no doubt that the accelerating integration into an efficient global economic system offers an abundance of opportunities for national economies of the region. It is also to be assumed that conditions and institutional mechanisms for trade, foreign investment and other forms of international co-operation will be more transparent, secure and prudent than before the economic crisis. Foreign direct investment flows into the region will be greatly enhanced in the years to come. Stabilized world markets for commodities, especially petroleum, will thereby be of major importance to Asia, as well as other global regions. That is where OPEC and oil producers outside the organization are trying to make their mark and, again, cooperation will further those efforts. In this changing system of greater interdependence of economies, policies and actions, the roles of both OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries are converging. The two sides have been working together on successive oil agreements, and several of our non-OPEC colleagues have become familiar faces at our Ministerial Conferences, where their input is seen as invaluable. But it is through these new forms of cooperation that the countries can observe, monitor and consult on development patterns in the energy sector, the driving forces, and implications for the global economy.

The economic development of Asia is crucial to the long-term growth of the international oil market. That becomes clear when you realize that the region forms part of the giant 21-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, which represents some 60 per cent of world economic output, and 45 per cent of global trade. In recent years, the importance of the Asia Pacific region as an outlet for our oil has risen enormously. OPEC crude exports to this market more than doubled to 7.59 mb/d between 1987 and 1998 - before falling back during the regional meltdown of that year. I don’t need to remind you of the effects of that crisis, which was triggered largely by the turbulence and vulnerability of financial markets. It sent alarming shock waves throughout the region, which reverberated throughout the entire world financial and economic system. Consequently, the crash had disastrous knock-on effects for all quarters of the economy, including energy, with the subsequent decline in oil demand, and the slump in global crude prices to near single digit levels. No area of the international oil industry escaped the potentially devastating effects of this collapse. In 1998 alone, OPEC producers lost around 56 billion dollars in petroleum export revenues, threatening essential development programmes. However, OPEC moved quickly to address the situation and implemented cuts in production in successive amounts, until prices were restored to reasonable levels. In fact, I am happy to say that the Organization emerged from this crisis stronger and more consolidated than it had ever been. Of course, for the region, the crisis brought to a sudden halt the runaway economic growth which had been the hallmark of the so-called Asian Tigers for several years. This rapid growth had represented a considerable step forward for the region in production, investment, international trade, and income. But the crisis revealed that growth, however impressive and sustained, can also have its vulnerable and weak links. Demand for Asian oil has now risen again, due to the recovery seen in the region, post 1998. As our latest figures clearly demonstrate, Asia remains a crucial market for OPEC. Economists are actually amazed at the speed of the region’s resurgence, but the overall signal is that consumer confidence is returning. With the Asian recovery in place, it is worth noting that the longer-term prospects for Asian energy demand look good, considering that the region’s per capita energy consumption is well below that of the industrialized countries. The potential for a rapid increase in energy demand, therefore, remains high.

As I have said, within the world’s developing countries, we continue to identify Asian states as the key source of the demand increase in the future. Between 2002 and 2025 they are expected to account for a rise of 18 mb/d in demand, which represents 65 percent of the total in all developing countries. In fact, this increase in Asia is almost half the global expansion expected over this period. China and India are central to this growth, with the boom in the transportation sector a particularly important factor. The huge potential for growth is clear from the low density of vehicles in these two countries, which stands at just over 10 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants. However, despite this obvious huge potential, there are many factors that may constrain the rise in oil demand in the future, especially regarding the necessary infrastructure, as well as the possible development of policies aimed at limiting growth. We must therefore be fully cognisant of the fact that large uncertainty will always exist when it comes to sustaining expected economic growth levels, as we, and the Asian region, learned to our cost in the past.

Looking in particular at your region - South-East Asia - it averaged impressive economic growth of more than six percent a year over the 10 years before1998, and is again expected to fare well again in the future. Today, together with Latin America, income per capita in South-East Asia is the highest of any of the developing country groups. However, our projections do show that there appears less scope for regional productivity expansion in the longer term, and GDP growth is forecast to increase by just over four percent annually in the medium term, but falling close to three percent in the long run.

As with the entire continent, South-East Asia is a very important market for our Member Countries, accounting for about 46 percent of OPEC’s total output. Major OPEC suppliers to this region are led by Saudi Arabia, followed by the UAE, Iran and Kuwait. The region is especially expected to grow in importance during the first quarter of this century. According to our projections, it will experience annual average oil demand growth of 3.1 percent for the period 2002–25, making it the third-biggest growth region in the world, after South Asia at 5.5 percent, and China at 4.4 percent. As you can imagine, OPEC takes this part of the world very seriously indeed.

The future extent of OPEC’s role in Asia will depend a great deal on ensuring oil price stability and supporting continued growth and equilibrium in the region. As a result of the Asian crisis, OPEC’s commitment has become more focused, with the awareness that Asia’s regional economies remain integral to world markets, and will continue to absorb a large proportion of incremental energy demand in the years ahead.

With all facets of the oil industry working together, I am convinced that we can achieve oil market stability, the effects of which remain crucial for the wellbeing of the global economy, and indeed growth and investment in Asia. Turning to the general oil market situation, my remarks today will be of particular significance, because of the volatile state of the international oil market over the past year and the possible impact of high oil prices on the vulnerable economies of many developing countries, especially if this situation lasts a long time. OPEC is very concerned about this matter and, as I shall elaborate upon later, is doing everything it can to restore order and stability to the market. Indeed, as I speak to you today, prices have fallen considerably from the very high levels of just a few weeks ago, thanks to OPEC’s policy of producing close to its maximum capacity. Hopefully, prices will soon return to levels that are acceptable to producers and consumers alike.

I shall begin this address by examining the fundamentals of the world oil sector, so as to establish that there will be plenty of oil for decades to come. As we shall see, most of the world’s proven oil reserves are located in OPEC’s Member Countries. Therefore, I shall provide some background about our Organization, to seek to assure you of our commitment to the future sound, orderly evolution of the oil market, for the benefit of producers and consumers alike. And I shall devote the final part of the address to the present volatile state of the market. Oil has been the world’s major commercial energy source for many decades and the consensus view is that it will maintain this leading role well into the 21st century.

[Slide 2] The pre-eminence of oil has run in parallel with the massive economic advances made in the 20th century and on into the 21st century. It is estimated that industrial production grew by around 50 times during the last century and that four-fifths of this growth happened in the second half of the century, starting with the reconstruction period after the Second World War.

[Slide 3] This resulted in an enormous increase in energy consumption.

[Slide 4] Most of the consumption has been concentrated in the OECD countries, although this is beginning to change now, with higher growth rates in the developing countries, including China.

[Slide 5] Oil dominated the world energy mix after the Second World War, with the OECD accounting for 60–70 percent of world oil consumption. Total and per capita consumption were much lower in the developing countries throughout this period, although this trend is now beginning to change. In both regions, there has been a steady increase in the use of gas.

[Slide 6] Currently, oil accounts for around 40 percent of the world energy mix. This is because it is a unique commodity, with a combination of attributes which far exceeds that of any other energy source — sufficiency, accessibility, versatility, ease of transport and, in many areas, low costs. These have been complemented by a multitude of practical benefits that can be gained in an established infrastructure from decades of intensive exploitation and use in the industrial, commercial and domestic fields. Advances in technology make oil a cleaner, safer and more efficient fuel, so that it can meet increasingly tighter environmental regulations, as well as conforming to the broader demands of sustainable development.

[Slide 7] There should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. The world’s oil resource base is not a constraint, with regard to meeting future demand. If we look at cumulative production, as a percentage of the estimated resource base, over the past four decades, we see that this has been relatively stable, and this is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future. Over and above the world’s proven crude oil reserves, there is still plenty of oil that has yet to be discovered, in regions whose geological structures suggest a high probability of commercially viable reserves.

The world’s proven reserves alone — of around 1,100 billion barrels — will be enough to meet demand for around 45 years, at current production rates, in simple mathematical terms. However, in practice, the situation is more optimistic than this. To begin with, production will not suddenly stop at a finite point; instead, there is likely to be a gradual transitional phase lasting many decades, as occurred when the world moved from the coal era to the oil era. Also, while, on the one hand, annual output is forecast to rise steadily in the early 21st century, on the other hand, recovery rates will also improve, through enhanced technology, improved infrastructure and better accessibility. Moreover, there is “unconventional oil”, such as tar sands, oil shale and heavy oil, and exploitation of this is expected to rise steadily in the future.

Let us see now how the situation may develop in the future. For our projections, we shall use the reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model.

These projections see global oil demand rising by 38 mb/d to 115 mb/d by 2025 — annual average growth of 1.6 mb/d, or 1.7 percent, over the years 2002–25.

[Slide 8] Around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves are located in OPEC’s Member Countries, although these 11 states account for only about two-fifths of current world output. Moreover, these reserves are more accessible and cheaper to exploit than those in non-OPEC areas. In 2025, OPEC is projected to meet more than half the world’s oil demand, at 51 percent, with 58 mb/d.

[Slide 9] Oil’s share of the world energy mix will dip slightly during this period, from 40 to 37 percent.

[Slide 10] Turning to the oil supply outlook, in the short-to-medium term, overall non-OPEC supply is expected to continue to increase, rising to a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. This represents an increase of 7–9 mb/d from 2002, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty. The key sources for the increase in non-OPEC supply will be Latin America, Africa, Russia and the Caspian.

With the forecast gradual depletion of non-OPEC reserves in the first quarter of the 21st century, OPEC will increasingly be called upon to supply the incremental barrel. OPEC has both the capability and the will to do this. [Slide 11] OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of world oil demand. However, almost three-quarters of the increase in demand of 38 mb/d over the period 2002–25 will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. This will be consistent with the forecast that the average annual economic growth rate of 5.0 percent for the developing countries will be double the OECD’s 2.5 percent, for the period up to 2025. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth.

[Slide 12] At the global level, the transportation sector accounts for about 60 percent of the rise in demand in 2000–25. This will amount to nearly all the growth in transition economies, almost four-fifths of it in the OECD, and close to half in developing countries. The industrial and household/commercial/agriculture sectors will also be important sources of growth in the developing world.

[Slide 13] OPEC is very much aware of the role it will need to play in the evolving international oil market. It is, indeed, an extension of the role it has been playing, with great effect, for many years and which has its roots in the OPEC Statute, which dates from 1961. This important document defines the Organization’s core values of stable markets, reasonable prices, steady revenues, secure supply and fair returns for investors.

Landmark declarations by OPEC in 1968, 1975 and 2000 extended the Organization’s orbit to cover a broader range of issues, including: the inalienable right of all countries to exercise permanent sovereignty over their indigenous natural resources; the promotion of a more equitable global economic system, with particular emphasis on alleviating poverty and other injustices affecting developing countries; sustainable development; and environmental harmony. As you will recall, these incorporate the qualities I outlined earlier, that are considered to be part of the broad-based mandate of the modern petroleum industry.

An important outcome of OPEC’s broader vision was the establishment of its own specialist multilateral development finance institution in 1976, to help other developing countries, especially the least-developed ones, pursue social and economic advancement. To date, the OPEC Fund for International Development has made total financial commitments of more than $7.22 bn to developing countries worldwide. Of this amount, some $4.8 bn has been disbursed. The Philippines is one of 111 countries that has benefited from OPEC Find assistance. Since the institution’s inception, it has received $83.25 mn in loans. This financing supported projects carried out in the sectors of agriculture, education, energy, transportation, as well as for multi—sectoral purposes. In addition, the Fund extended three grants to the country The Vienna-based Fund is continuing to broaden its activities - a thrust that is proving invaluable to some of the world’s most impoverished nations.

OPEC keeps a close watch, at all times, on energy market developments, as part of its ongoing research activities, at its Vienna-based Secretariat. This covers all reasonable time-horizons — the short term, the medium term and the long term. The purpose is to provide the Organization’s Oil Ministers with the necessary high-quality support material for their decision-making on market issues, whether this be for their short-term production agreements or for their deliberations on important longer-term issues.

One of the most basic issues facing OPEC — and, let us not forget, other oil producers too — is to ensure that sufficient production capacity will be available at all times to help meet the forecast significant rise in oil demand in the coming years and decades. This brings us onto the subject of investment.

[Slide 14] Investment is needed: to meet the forecast absolute increase in demand; to see that exhausted reserves are replaced, as and when necessary; and to ensure that oil-producing nations always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply. Also, the oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before, to meet the very high expectations of the modern consumer.

Furthermore, producers need assurances of stable, predictable markets, just as much as consumers require certainty and consistency with supplies — security of demand is as important as security of supply. The required investment will be large, although it will not necessarily be different in magnitude to that observed in the past. Also, the cost of investment in OPEC oil is much lower than in non-OPEC oil.

[Slide 15] However, the magnitude of the required capital injection is far from clear, even in the short and medium terms. This is partly due to the wide range of feasible demand growth scenarios, but it is also reinforced by contrasting views on the potential evolution of non-OPEC production. Uncertainties over future economic growth, government policies and the rate of development and diffusion of newer technologies are among the main factors that lie behind this. To illustrate this, if we reduce our global economic growth projections by just one per cent, this will lower the investment requirement for 2010 from a reference case $95 bn to $70 bn — which is a big difference.

To appreciate the significance of all this, one must consider investment lead times that are measured in years rather than months, as well as the importance of “getting it right” i.e. over-investment may result in excessive, costly, idle capacity and under-investment may lead to a shortage of crude and higher prices. In both cases, the losses, especially for producing countries, and the possible, broader associated damage, such as to the world economy, can be huge. Because of the long lead times, it may take years to correct a situation of heavy over- or under-investment.

Clearly, any sound investment strategy must be built upon a solid base. This underlines the need for market order and stability today, with reasonable prices. This is, sadly, not the case at the present time.

[Slide 16] As I noted at the start of this address, the current market volatility and high prices have been a major cause for concern among OPEC’s Member Countries.

Prices for OPEC’s Reference Basket of seven crudes — which was introduced as a pricing yardstick in January 1987 — rose above US $45 a barrel for the first time in October, before retreating to $36-38 by mid-November. To put this in context, it compares with an average level of just over $25/b that prevailed for several years at the beginning of the 21st century — from the inception of OPEC’s innovative price band in 2000 through 2003. That average was close to the centre of the $22–28/b price band, showing how effective this market-stabilisation device was, as a result of the realistic nature of its upper and lower limits, which were, in turn, considered fair and reasonable by producers and consumers alike. Thus it won wide acceptance in the oil community.

[Slide 17] We see a combination of factors as contributing to the destabilisation of prices this year — even though, throughout, the market has remained well-supplied with crude and fundamentals have been sound: higher-than-expected oil demand growth, especially in China and the United States; refining and distribution industry bottlenecks in some major consuming regions, coupled with more stringent product specifications and compounded by the recent hurricanes in the Americas; and the present geopolitical tensions and concern about adequacy of spare capacity to meet possible supply disruptions. Combined, these factors have led to fears about a possible future supply shortage of crude oil, which, in turn, have resulted in increased speculation in the futures markets, with substantial upward pressure on prices.

[Slide 18] The introduction of stringent new product specifications in refining that came into force in the United States this year, and are scheduled for Europe at the start of next year, have caused considerable problems in this section of the industry. Stricter specifications have also been adopted in some developing states, where local refiners are even less prepared to meet the new requirements, posing quite a challenge. By our calculations, conversion facilities worldwide now stand at about 45 percent of total refining capacity, which does not provide refiners with sufficient operational flexibility to handle heavy sour crudes. The picture in Asia is even more acute, with only 30 percent conversion so far achieved. And most of these conversions are in units that produce gasoline, and not middle distillates which are in higher demand in the winter months. With the seasonal increase for middle distillates already upon us, the shortage of upgrading and desulphurization capacity has intensified refiners’ concerns about the security of light sweet crude. Given strengthening demand, most refineries are now running at near maximum operational capacity in a bid to keep up. At such levels, despite the economic incentive of higher growth, refiners are not able to use heavier crude oil as it might affect operations, due to the conversion bottlenecks and product specification limitations.

[Slide 19] Earlier this year, Hurricane Ivan had a substantial effect on gasoline output in the United States, but the recent re-emergence of American refineries and plants in Europe after their pre-winter turnaround should see an increase in distillate stocks, although this has not happened yet, leaving many traders concerned that a seasonal shortage will occur. Unfortunately, there is this persistent shortage of refining capacity in the United States. This is hardly surprising when you consider that between1981 and 1999 the number of operating plants in the country fell from 324 to 159, with capacity declining from 19 million b/d to just over 16 million b/d. There have been no new plants built, and there are also problems in the country&apos;s distribution network, which is both insufficient and inadequate. Combine this situation with the limited upgrading capacity in Asia, and the market is left vulnerable to increased price volatility as speculators in the futures market move to take advantage of any shortfall.

[Slide 20] The new restrictions have come at a time when refinery capacity is already stretched to the limit. In addition to the shortages in refined products, the perception of lower oil inventories - increasingly an industry norm – has also contributed to market volatility. The recent employment of “just-in-time” stocks’ management by the oil industry has almost certainly reduced the amount of stored oil that can be considered “normal”, and this is something the industry seems to have to live with in the future. However, the higher production from OPEC Member Countries of late has contributed to producing a counter-seasonal build in OECD petroleum stocks at the end of the third quarter. This has resulted over the past few weeks in a steady increase in commercial crude oil inventories in the United States to levels that are now considered to be quite healthy. There has also been a massive build-up of stocks of crude oil and middle distillates in Japan, while in Western Europe, even though our latest figures show a slight drawdown in inventories in the last few weeks, stock levels are still around two percent above levels seen at the same time last year.

[Slide 21] It is interesting to see the wide variety of factors that can affect the oil price over a certain period. Taking daily readings of the price for West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange for the first 11 months of this year, we noted more than 30 different factors that were, on one or more occasions, identified by analysts as influencing a daily price movement! The figures in the slide show their net upward or downward effect between January and November 2004.

[Slide 22] To help restore order and stability to the oil market in recent months, OPEC has raised its production ceiling three times, by a total of 3.5 mb/d for OPEC-10 (OPEC, excluding Iraq), to 27.0 mb/d. We did this, even though our assessments had indicated that there was sufficient crude in the market and that Member Countries were already producing well above previous ceilings. Our latest studies show that, for the third quarter, the market was over-supplied by nearly 2 mb/d and that this trend was being continued into the fourth quarter, although to a lesser extent, due to demand seasonality and other factors. However, in reaching our production agreements, it was believed that, as well as the actual physical fact of agreeing to these big increases in supply, such actions, in themselves, would also send a powerful psychological signal that OPEC was ready to act in order to help stabilise prices.

The easing price trend of recent weeks of almost $10/b – with the OPEC Basket down to $36 a barrel by mid-November - can be attributed in great part to the Organization’s continued efforts to restore order and stability. A further Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference is scheduled for 10 December in Cairo, to review market developments and, if necessary, adjust the production ceiling accordingly. The decisions we take will, understandably, be influenced by the outlook for 2005.

Initial forecasts from recognised sources for 2005 assume a moderate slowdown in global economic growth. We project an annual growth rate of 4.1 percent for 2005, compared with the 4.9 percent currently forecast for this year. Growth will be much faster in developing countries than in the OECD — 5.0 percent compared with 2.8 percent — while, separately, China is projected to experience 7.6 percent growth in 2005, and Russia 6.0 percent. Let us look at the impact this will have on oil demand in 2005 — especially at a time when there may be attempts to fill strategic petroleum reserves in China, India and, possibly, the United States. Demand growth forecasts for next year fall within a wide range of 1.4–2.4 mb/d, with an average of around 1.8 mb/d. OPEC itself projects 1.6 mb/d. Asia is expected to account for a significant proportion of this growth.

Looking at supply, forecasts for increases in 2005 non-OPEC supply also cover a wide range, between 0.7 mb/d and 1.6 mb/d, with a mean of about 1.0 mb/d. OPEC’s projections see an increase of 1.2 mb/d. According to various sources, the difference between world oil demand and non-OPEC supply is expected to increase for the third consecutive year. The preliminary market balance forecasts — demand minus non-OPEC supply — are also spread across a wide range, from 27.4 mb/d to 29.4 mb/d, with an average of around 28.1 mb/d. OPEC expects this number, which is, effectively, the call on OPEC oil, to be at the low end of the range.

[Slide 23] With regard to the ability to meet rising demand in the short-to-medium term, OPEC has spare production capacity of around 1.5 mb/d, which would allow for an immediate additional increase in production. Moreover, in response to the expected demand growth in the near future, Member Countries have plans in place to increase spare capacity further in 2005, to over 2.5 mb/d. These are all very big issues that we are facing — short term, medium term and long term. And I say “we”, because I am talking about the oil industry as a whole — producers, consumers, governments, the large oil companies, the financial institutions, and any other party that has a significant role to play in the general welfare, effectiveness, growth, and general evolution of the industry. Market order and stability is a shared responsibility for all parties.

When OPEC makes its production agreements, it does so in the expressed expectation that non-OPEC producers will actively support our measures, since this will make our decisions more effective and we will all benefit from this. When OPEC turns its attention to the future, we envisage this as a collective task for the industry and we seek to get as wide a range of views, opinions, information and data as possible. The challenges facing all of us are too large, too complex and too important to be left to individual, concerned groups.

[Slide 24] Big advances in dialogue and cooperation among producers and consumers have been an encouraging feature of the past couple of decades, from large-scale international ministerial gatherings, such as the meetings of the now-institutionalised International Energy Forum, to bilateral or regional contacts that extend across national boundaries. Indeed, the establishment of the Forum’s Secretariat in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia, bears witness to OPEC’s commitment to dialogue and cooperation. Recent years have also witnessed the development of a closer working relationship between OPEC and the International Energy Agency, to exchange ideas and information. We are involved in a series of joint meetings among OPEC and non-OPEC producers — the most recent was held in Oman in October. We also engage in annual dialogue with high-level energy officials and research institutes from China, Japan and South Korea.

OPEC welcomes all of this. The industry is much better-off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of handling, at least, the major issues that concern all parties — such as price stability, security of demand and supply, investment, environmental issues and sustainable development.

Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, I have tried to provide an overview of the principal issues that we, in OPEC, believe support the present and future viability of the petroleum industry. It is truly a vast and complex business. However, there is a strong sense of optimism about the future.

[Slide 25] We are confident that the industry will successfully rise to the challenges facing it in an increasingly globalised industry, where technology is enabling us to make remarkable advances in every field of activity and where the orderly, equitable provision of cleaner, safer energy services is seen as an integral part of sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and the general enhancement of mankind.

Finally, I would like to stress that we in OPEC hope that this visit by our officials will help to strengthen your country’s diplomatic ties with the oil-exporting countries, a move that would surely lead to an improved mutual understanding of issues important to both OPEC and the Philippines on energy and development. It is only through dialogue and regular contact that the two sides can forge a better understanding of each other’s needs and requirements, which, in the long run may help us to better deal with, and even overcome, the type of situation your country now faces. For us, cooperation, coordination, and collaboration are the key to a successful future.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/346-2-december-2004.html"
"2004-11-10","Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers of the Tenth International Financial and Economic Forum for inviting me to deliver this address on “Oil and gas: the engine of the world economy”.

I shall focus on the oil industry, since this is OPEC’s principal area of interest. However, whenever necessary, I shall add some remarks about gas. Oil has been the world’s major commercial energy source for many decades and the consensus view is that it will maintain this leading role well into the 21st century.

[Slide 2] The pre-eminence of oil has run in parallel with the massive economic advances made in the 20th century and on into the 21st century. It is estimated that industrial production grew by around 50 times during the last century and that four-fifths of this growth happened in the second half of the century, starting with the reconstruction period after the second world war.

[Slide 3] This resulted in an enormous increase in energy consumption.

[Slide 4] Most of the consumption has been concentrated in the OECD countries, although this is beginning to change now, with higher growth rates in the developing countries, including China.

Oil dominated the world energy mix after the second world war, with the OECD accounting for 60–70 per cent of world oil consumption. Total and per capita energy consumption were much lower in the developing countries throughout this period, although this trend is now beginning to change. In both regions, there has been a steady increase in the use of gas.

[Slide 5] Currently, oil accounts for around 40 per cent of the world energy mix. This is because of its unique combination of attributes — sufficiency, accessibility, versatility, ease of transport and, in many areas, low costs. These have been complemented by a multitude of practical benefits that can be gained in an established infrastructure from decades of intensive exploitation and use in the industrial, commercial and domestic fields. Advances in technology make oil a cleaner, safer and more efficient fuel.

[Slide 6] There should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. The world’s oil resource base is not a constraint, with regard to meeting future demand. If we look at cumulative production, as a percentage of the estimated resource base, over the past four decades, we see that this has been relatively stable, and this is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future. Over and above the world’s proven crude oil reserves, there is still plenty of oil that has yet to be discovered, in regions whose geological structures suggest a high probability of commercially viable reserves.

The world’s proven reserves alone — of around 1,100 billion barrels — will be enough to meet demand for around 45 years, at current production rates, in simple mathematical terms. However, in practice, the situation is more optimistic than this. To begin with, production will not suddenly stop at a finite point; instead, there is likely to be a gradual transitional phase lasting many decades, as occurred when the world moved from the coal era to the oil era. Also, while, on the one hand, annual output is forecast to rise steadily in the early 21st century, on the other hand, recovery rates will also improve, through enhanced technology, improved infrastructure and better accessibility. Moreover, there is “unconventional oil”, such as tar sands, oil shale and heavy oil, and exploitation of this is expected to rise steadily in the future.

[Slide 7] Gas producers share many of the challenges of oil producers. Moreover, order and stability in the oil sector are essential not just for oil, but also for gas. This is because of the linkage between oil and gas prices in many major consumer markets, whereby oil price movements have an influence on gas prices.

Gas currently accounts for around 23 per cent of the world’s commercial energy mix. Gas is the source of commercial energy most favoured by environmentalists, as well as being a reliable and highly efficient source of power generation. Production costs are coming down too. But the transportation of gas remains expensive. As with oil, there are enough gas resources in the world to meet demand for generations to come.

Let us see now how the situation may develop in the future, using the reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model. Our projections show global oil demand rising by 38 million barrels a day to 115 mb/d by 2025 — an annual average growth rate of 1.7 per cent.

[Slide 8] Oil’s share of the world energy mix will dip slightly during this period, from 40 to 37 per cent.

[Slide 9] OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of world oil demand. However, almost three-quarters of the increase in demand of 38 mb/d over the period 2002–25 will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth.

[Slide 10] At the global level, the transportation sector accounts for about 60 per cent of the rise in demand in 2000–25.

[Slide 11] Turning to supply, overall non-OPEC output is expected to continue to increase, reaching a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. This represents an increase of 7–9 mb/d from 2002, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty. The key sources for the increase in non-OPEC supply will be Latin America, Africa, Russia and the Caspian.

OPEC will increasingly be called upon to supply the incremental barrel. OPEC has both the capability and the will to do this.

[Slide 12] Around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves are located in OPEC’s Member Countries. Moreover, these reserves are more accessible and cheaper to exploit than those in non-OPEC areas. In 2025, OPEC is projected to meet more than half the world’s oil demand, at 51 per cent, with 58 mb/d.

Let us now look briefly at gas. Our Member Countries hold almost half the world’s proven natural gas reserves. According to our projections, world gas demand is expected to more than double in the first quarter of the 21st century, reaching almost 90 mb/d of oil equivalent by 2025. This will constitute an average annual rate of demand growth of around 3.0 per cent. The share of gas in the world energy mix will rise to around 30 per cent in this period.

[Slide 13] OPEC is deeply aware of its role in the evolving international oil market. The Organization’s core values are stable markets, reasonable prices, steady revenues, secure supply and fair returns for investors.

OPEC monitors oil market developments closely for the short, medium and long terms, so as to provide the its Oil Ministers with the necessary high-quality support material for their decision-making.

One of the most basic issues facing OPEC — and, let us not forget, other oil producers too — is to ensure that sufficient production capacity will be available at all times to help meet the forecast heavy rise in oil demand. [Slide 14] Investment is needed: to meet the forecast absolute increase in demand; to replace exhausted reserves; and to ensure that oil producers always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply. Also, the oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before.

Furthermore, producers need assurances of stable, predictable markets, just as much as consumers require certainty and consistency with supplies — security of demand is as important as security of supply.

The required investment will be large, although it will not necessarily be different in magnitude to that observed in the past. Also, the cost of investment in OPEC oil is much lower than in non-OPEC oil.

[Slide 15] However, the magnitude of the required capital injection is far from clear, even in the short and medium terms. This is partly due to the wide range of feasible demand growth scenarios, but it is also reinforced by contrasting views on the potential evolution of non-OPEC production. Uncertainties over future economic growth, government policies and the rate of development and diffusion of newer technologies are among the main factors that lie behind this. To illustrate this, if we reduce our global economic growth projections by just one per cent, this will lower the investment requirement for 2010 from a reference case $95 bn to $70 bn — which is a big difference.

To appreciate the significance of all this, one must consider investment lead times that are measured in years rather than months, as well as the importance of “getting it right” i.e. over-investment may result in excessive, costly, idle capacity and under-investment may lead to a shortage of crude and higher prices. In both cases, the losses, especially for producing countries, and the possible, broader associated damage, such as to the world economy, can be huge. Because of the long lead times, it may take years to correct a situation of heavy over- or under-investment.

Clearly, any sound investment strategy must be built upon a solid base. This underlines the need for market order and stability today, with reasonable prices. This is, sadly, not the case at the present time.

[Slide 16] Prices for OPEC’s Reference Basket of seven crudes have recently reached record levels. They rose above US $45 a barrel for the first time ever last month; this compares with the widely accepted average level of $25.8/b from the inception of the OPEC price band in 2000 through 2003.

[Slide 17] A combination of factors has contributed to this — even though, throughout, the market has remained well-supplied with crude and fundamentals have been sound: higher-than-expected oil demand growth, especially in China and the USA; refining and distribution industry bottlenecks in some major consuming regions, coupled with more stringent product specifications and compounded by the recent hurricanes in the Americas; and the present geopolitical tensions and concern about adequacy of spare capacity to meet possible supply disruptions. Combined, these factors have led to fears about a possible future supply shortage, which, in turn, have resulted in increased speculation in futures markets, with substantial upward pressure on prices.

[Slide 18] To help restore order and stability, OPEC has raised its production ceiling three times, by a total of 3.5 million barrels a day for OPEC-10 (OPEC, excluding Iraq), to 27.0 mb/d. We did this, even though our assessments had indicated that there was sufficient crude in the market and that Member Countries were already producing well above previous ceilings. It was believed that, as well as the actual physical fact of agreeing to these big increases in supply, such actions, in themselves, would also send a powerful psychological signal that OPEC was ready to act in order to help stabilise prices.

[Slide 19] With regard to the ability to meet rising demand in the short-to-medium term, OPEC has spare production capacity of around 1.5–2.0 mb/d, which would allow for an immediate additional increase in production. Furthermore, Member Countries have plans in place to increase capacity by a further 1 mb/d towards the end of this year and by at least another 1 mb/d through 2005. In addition, plans for additional capacity expansion are available and could be enacted soon; however, this capacity would, typically, become available around 18 months after commencement of this process. Nevertheless, it must be pointed out that our latest studies show that, for the third quarter, the market was over-supplied by nearly 2 mb/d and that this trend was being continued into the fourth quarter, although to a lesser extent, due to demand seasonality and other factors.

These are all very big challenges that we are facing. And I say “we”, because I am talking about the oil industry as a whole — producers, consumers, governments, the large oil companies, the financial institutions and any other party that has a significant role to play in the general welfare, the effectiveness, the growth and the general evolution of the industry. Market order and stability is a shared responsibility for all parties.

When OPEC makes its production agreements, it does so in the expressed expectation that non-OPEC producers will actively support our measures, since this will make our decisions more effective, to everyone’s benefit. When OPEC turns its attention to the future, we envisage this as a collective task for the industry and we seek to get as wide a range of views, opinions, information and data as possible. The challenges facing all of us are too large, too complex and too important to be left to individual, concerned groups.

[Slide 20] Big advances in dialogue and cooperation among producers and consumers have been an encouraging feature of the past couple of decades, from large-scale international ministerial gatherings, such as the meetings of the now-institutionalised International Energy Forum, to bilateral or regional contacts that extend across national boundaries. Indeed, the establishment of the Forum’s Secretariat in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia, bears witness to OPEC’s commitment to dialogue and cooperation. Recent years have also witnessed the development of a closer working relationship between OPEC and the International Energy Agency, to exchange ideas and information. We are involved in a series of joint meetings among OPEC and non-OPEC producers — the most recent was held in Oman last month.

For gas, the recent formation of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum recognises the need for discussion of issues of mutual interest to gas producers and its role is likely to grow in the future. Its membership includes seven OPEC Countries. OPEC welcomes all of this. The industry is much better-off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of handling, at least, the major issues that concern all parties — such as price stability, security of demand and supply, investment, environmental issues and sustainable development.

Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

[Slide 21] We are confident that the petroleum industry will successfully rise to the challenges facing it in an increasingly globalised industry, where technology is enabling us to make remarkable advances in every field of activity and where the orderly, equitable provision of cleaner, safer energy services is seen as an integral part of sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and the general enhancement of mankind.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/347-10-november-2004.html"
"2004-10-26","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to address this opening plenary session of the 4th Russian Oil and Gas Week, here in Moscow. As this vast country’s petroleum sector continues to play a growing role on the world stage, so do the importance and relevance of this event establish themselves on the international energy calendar.

At the present time, the eyes of the world are focused on the near-term outlook, due to the volatile state of the international oil market. This is understandable. However, as I am sure all of us here today appreciate, this constitutes only part of the challenge facing us. We are also committed to the future of the industry. And so, during this address, I shall be looking at both the present and future outlooks, which are, of course, linked. My remarks will focus on oil, because this is OPEC’s principal area of interest.

The current market volatility and high prices have been a major cause for concern among OPEC’s Member Countries. Prices for OPEC’s Reference Basket of seven crudes have recently reached record levels, since this yardstick was introduced in January 1987. They rose above US $45 a barrel for the first time earlier this month; this compares with an average level of $25.8/b from the inception of the OPEC price band in 2000 through 2003. In other words, the average was close to the centre of the $22–28/b price band during that period, and this won wide acceptance among producers and consumers, as being both fair and reasonable.

We see a combination of factors contributing to the rising price trend this year — even though, throughout, the market has remained well-supplied with crude and fundamentals have been sound: higher-than-expected oil demand growth, especially in China and the USA; refining and distribution industry bottlenecks in some major consuming regions, coupled with more stringent product specifications and compounded by the recent hurricanes in the Americas; and the present geopolitical tensions and concern about adequacy of spare capacity to meet possible supply disruptions. Combined, these factors have led to fears about a possible future supply shortage of crude oil, which, in turn, have resulted in increased speculation in the futures markets, with substantial upward pressure on prices.

To help restore order and stability, OPEC raised its production ceiling twice, at Meetings of our Ministerial Conference on 3 June and 15 September. The total rise for OPEC-10 (that is, OPEC excluding Iraq) was 3.5 million barrels a day, to take the ceiling to 27.0 mb/d, with the final increase of 1.0 mb/d coming into effect on 1 November. These decisions were taken, even though our assessments had indicated that there was sufficient crude already in the market and that Member Countries were already pumping out levels of crude well above previous ceilings. It was believed that, as well as the actual physical fact of agreeing to these big increases in supply, such actions, in themselves, would also send a powerful psychological signal that OPEC was ready to act in order to help stabilise prices.

With regard to the ability to meet rising demand in the short-to-medium term, OPEC has spare production capacity of around 1.5–2.0 mb/d, which would allow for an immediate additional increase in production. Furthermore, in response to the expected demand growth in the near future, Member Countries have plans in place to further increase capacity by at least 1 mb/d towards the end of this year and through 2005. In addition, plans for additional capacity expansion are available and could be enacted soon; however, this capacity would, typically, become available around 18 months after commencement of this process.

Nevertheless, in saying all this, it must be pointed out that our latest studies show that, for the third quarter, the market was over-supplied by nearly 2 mb/d and that this trend was being continued into the fourth quarter, although to a lesser extent, due to demand seasonality and other factors. A further Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference is scheduled for 10 December in Cairo, to review market developments and, if necessary, adjust the production ceiling agreement accordingly.

OPEC keeps a close watch, at all times, on energy market developments, as part of its ongoing research activities, at its Vienna-based Secretariat. This covers all reasonable time-horizons — the short term, the medium term and the long term. The purpose is to provide the Organization’s Oil Ministers with the necessary high-quality support material for their decision-making on market issues, whether this be for their short-term production agreements or for their deliberations on important longer-term issues. The objective throughout is to achieve and maintain market order and stability, with reasonable prices, steady revenues, secure supply and fair returns for investors.

Let us now look further into the future, to 2025. According to our projections, based on OPEC’s World Energy Model, “OWEM”, the early decades of the 21st century are expected to see fossil fuels account predominantly for increases in world energy demand, with oil continuing to maintain its major role. There is also a clear expectation that the oil resource base is sufficiently abundant to satisfy this demand growth.

Our reference case sees average annual world economic growth of 3.6 per cent over the period 2003–25, with the most rapid rates being in the developing countries, particularly China, which has a projected figure of 6.4 per cent. The average annual rate of 5.0 per cent for the developing countries is double the OECD’s 2.5 per cent, for the period up to 2025.

Global oil demand is projected to rise by 38 million barrels a day to 115 mb/d by 2025 — annual average growth of 1.6 mb/d, or 1.7 per cent, over the years 2002–25. OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of oil demand. However, almost three-quarters of the increase in demand up to 2025 will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. Asian countries will remain the key source of demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth.

At the global level, the transportation sector accounts for about 60 per cent of the rise in demand in 2000–25. This will amount to nearly all the growth in transition economies, almost four-fifths of it in the OECD and close to half in developing countries. The industrial and household/commercial/agriculture sectors will also be important sources of growth in the developing world.

Turning to the oil supply outlook, in the short-to-medium term, overall non-OPEC supply is expected to continue to increase, reaching a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. This represents an increase of 7–9 mb/d from 2002, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty. The key sources for the increase in non-OPEC supply will be Latin America, Africa, Russia and the Caspian.

This will all result in OPEC being increasingly called upon to supply the incremental barrel. OPEC has both the capability and the will to do this. Around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves are located in OPEC’s Member Countries, although these 11 states account for only about two-fifths of current world output. Moreover, these reserves are more accessible and cheaper to exploit than those in non-OPEC areas. In 2025, OPEC is projected to meet more than half the world’s oil demand, at 51 per cent, with 58 mb/d.

Thus, one of the most basic challenges facing OPEC — as well as other oil producers — is to ensure that sufficient production capacity will be available at all times to help meet the forecast rise in oil demand in the coming years and decades. This brings us onto the subject of investment. However, before discussing this, I should like to say a few words about other energy sources, especially gas.

Order and stability in the oil sector are essential not just for oil, but also for gas. This is because of the linkage between oil and gas prices in major consumer markets, with oil price movements in volatile markets likely to be followed, to some extent, by same-direction gas price movements. Therefore, the case for ensuring that a sound international oil price structure is in place at all times finds further valuable support.

OPEC has a strong base in the gas industry, even though the focus of our Organization is on the oil market. Our Member Countries hold almost half the world’s proven natural gas reserves, with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Qatar being second and third, respectively, to Russia, in global rankings. Algeria and Indonesia also place a heavy emphasis on the gas sector, in their hydrocarbon activities.

Gas producers share many of the basic challenges of oil producers. Demand for gas is forecast to rise faster than that of oil, although from a lower base. It is the source of commercial energy that is most favoured by environmentalists, as well as being a reliable and highly efficient source of power generation. Production costs are coming down too.

But the transportation of gas remains expensive, in spite of the big advances that are being made with liquefied natural gas, which are expected to turn it from being a regional to a global fuel. Also, legislation to liberalise energy markets, particularly in the European Union, has been handled without due regard to longstanding agreements with gas suppliers.

The share of gas in the world energy mix is around 23 per cent at the moment and this is expected to climb to 30 per cent by 2025. Even so, this will still be well below the share of oil, which will have dipped slightly from around 40 per cent now to 37 per cent share in 2025. The share of solids — mainly coal — will remain at around 25–26 per cent during this period, while that of hydro, nuclear and renewables, treated as one group in this analysis, will fall by more than two percentage points to eight per cent.

This begs the question: What about the future contribution of renewables? While there is an understandable call to develop renewables, the fact remains that the technology is still in its infancy. Therefore, while the renewable energy industry is being developed, all other available resources, which are friendly to the environment, must also be accessed, enhanced and utilised to meet the energy needs of mankind and support sustainable development. Petroleum has a big role to play in this.

This underlines the need for full and timely investment in oil production capacity. Investment is needed: to meet the forecast absolute increase in demand; to see that exhausted reserves are replaced, as and when necessary; and to ensure that oil-producing nations always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply. Also, the oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before, to meet the very high expectations of the modern consumer.

This investment will be large — although not necessarily different in magnitude to that observed in the past. However, the magnitude of the required capital injection is far from clear, even in the short and medium terms. This is partly due to the wide range of feasible demand growth scenarios, but it is also reinforced by contrasting views on the potential evolution of non-OPEC production. Uncertainties over future economic growth, government policies and the rate of development and diffusion of newer technologies are among the main factors that lie behind this.

To appreciate the significance of this, one must consider investment lead times that are measured in years rather than months, as well as the importance of “getting it right” i.e. over-investment may result in excessive, costly, idle capacity and under-investment may lead to a shortage of crude and higher prices. In both cases, the losses and the broader collateral damage, such as to the world economy, can be huge.

Producers, in particular, are very concerned about the risk of over-investment, which can prove extremely costly to them. Every effort must be made, therefore, to guard against this, by improving the effectiveness of forecasting and reducing the uncertainties that hinder this process.

Moreover, it is important to note here that, while most people are all-too-familiar with the concept of security of supply, there is also a flip-side to this coin — security of demand. Producers need assurances of stable, predictable markets just as much as consumers require certainty and consistency with supplies.

Also worthy of our attention is the fact that much of the recent price volatility has resulted from problems and bottlenecks in the downstream sector. This is very much the preserve of consuming nations, even though, in recent years, oil producers have been gaining a bigger presence downstream, too.

In short, the onus is on the oil community at large to ensure that the market is well-run. A collective approach is required. All responsible parties stand to gain from a stable, orderly market. After all, the starting-point for a sound investment strategy is market order and stability today, with reasonable prices. All parties must contribute to this — OPEC and non-OPEC producers, consumers, oil companies, financial institutions, governments and so on. The challenges are too large, too complex and too important to be left to individual, concerned groups. Big advances in dialogue and cooperation have facilitated this process over the past couple of decades, from large-scale international ministerial gatherings, such as the meetings of the now-institutionalised International Energy Forum, to bilateral or regional contacts that extend across national boundaries. Indeed, the establishment of the Forum’s Secretariat in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia, bears witness to OPEC’s commitment to dialogue and cooperation. Recent years have also witnessed the development of a closer working relationship between OPEC and the International Energy Agency, to exchange ideas and information.

Cooperation is not confined to the oil industry, of course. The recent formation of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum recognises the need for discussion of issues of mutual interest to gas producers and its role is likely to grow in the future. Its membership includes seven OPEC Member Countries and Russia. The fact that these eight countries are also leading oil producers brings with it further important benefits, in terms of cooperation across the two closely related petroleum sectors.

OPEC welcomes all of this. The oil and gas industries are much better-off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of handling, at least, the major issues that concern all parties — such as price stability, security of demand and supply, and investment.

This should all be done in a framework of an increasingly globalised industry, where technology is enabling us to make remarkable advances in every field of activity and where the orderly, equitable provision of cleaner, safer energy services is seen as an integral part of sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and the general enhancement of mankind.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/348-26-october-2004.html"
"2004-10-17","Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

As I understand it, most of you are at the beginning of your professional lives in the petroleum industry. We believe you are entering an industry that is dynamic and in good shape. This has been due to the dedication, the commitment and the expertise of generations of personnel who have devoted their careers to its development and enhancement, since its foundation in the middle of the 19th century.

It has moved forward with the times, reflecting the attitudes, the philosophies and the concerns of each passing era. It has also embodied a resolute pioneering spirit and has pushed forward the boundaries of innovation and enterprise. It has never stood still. It is now very different to the business that existed even a quarter of a century ago.

The industry, into which your generation will rise and inhabit and excel, is concerned with more than just energy supply. It seeks to benefit mankind as a whole. It embraces an awareness and sensitivity of the economic and social needs of the global community at large. Sustainable development, economic, environmental and social harmony, and other basic human issues provide reference points that may well define your careers in the years ahead.

We should, therefore, like to congratulate both the World Petroleum Congress and the Chinese National Committee for WPC on recognising the true nature of the challenges facing the industry and on launching the idea of the First Youth Forum, as well as undergoing the formidable task of organising it here in Beijing. Our gratitude is also expressed to the other Chinese enterprises that are co-hosts of this event.

The capital city of China is a suitable venue for this forum, since this country is experiencing remarkable economic expansion and currently is the major growth area in the world energy community. In such a dynamic and progressive setting, it is clearly symbolic of youth and the future.

Thus — for both China and the world at large — it is vital that we continue to attract to the industry the most skilled, the most qualified and the most committed people. Moreover, we must ensure that the industry is appealing enough and challenging enough to hold onto them during the course of their long careers. Sound investment in human capital is indispensable for any viable business that aspires to long-term growth and prosperity.

What do we find attractive about a career in petroleum?

First, there is the sheer importance of energy for the evolution of mankind. Mankind will always need energy. Therefore, a career dedicated to the energy industry has a special undertone to it, since, in the final analysis, we are providing a service which is basic to human needs.

Secondly, petroleum has a special appeal, because it has long been the market leader — the main source — in the world energy mix and is expected to remain so well into the 21st century. The future is still with petroleum.

Thirdly, there are exciting challenges in the years ahead in an industry which is highly competitive and operates at the sharp end of technology. Producers must, for example, meet the forecast rising oil demand in a manner which is both timely and compatible with such objectives as sustainable development and social, economic and environmental harmony.

Fourthly, there are many opportunities for personnel to excel and for their efforts to be rewarded in the form of career progression, remuneration and other benefits. The industry has a long history of rewarding ability and commitment.

And finally, there are the qualities of working in the industry itself. Many tasks are, in themselves, dynamic and stimulating. There are chances to travel or relocate in different parts of the world. There are opportunities to mix with a diverse range of nationalities, cultures and backgrounds. And there is a strong feeling of comradeship among people committed to seeing their tasks performed to perfection.

Let us now look more closely at the industry.

Past development

Oil has been the world’s major commercial energy source for many decades and the consensus view is that it will maintain this leading role well into the 21st century. Here are some of the underlying trends.

OECD countries have, by and large, enjoyed very high, steady growth since the end of the second world war, and this has occurred in line with an enormous expansion of the world economy. Industrial production grew by around 50 times during the 20th century and four-fifths of this growth happened after 1950.

This resulted in an enormous increase in energy consumption, most of which was concentrated in the OECD countries.

Oil dominated the world energy mix after the second world war, with the OECD accounting for 60–70 per cent of world oil consumption. Total and per capita energy consumption was much lower in the developing countries throughout this period, although this trend is now beginning to change. In both regions, there has been a steady increase in the use of gas.

Currently, oil accounts for around 40 per cent of the world energy mix. This is because it is a unique commodity, with a combination of attributes which far exceeds that of any other energy source — sufficiency, accessibility, versatility, ease of transport and, in many areas, low costs. These have been complemented by a multitude of practical benefits that can be gained from decades of intensive exploitation and use in the industrial, commercial and domestic fields. Advances in technology make oil a cleaner, safer and more efficient fuel, so that it can meet increasingly tighter environmental regulations, as well as conforming to the broader demands of sustainable development.

The world’s proven crude oil reserves total around 1,100 billion barrels, which, in simple mathematical terms, will be enough to meet demand for around 45 years, at current production rates.

However, in practice, the situation is not as simple as this. To begin with, production will not suddenly stop at a finite point; instead, there is likely to be a gradual transitional phase lasting many decades, as occurred when the world moved from the coal era to the oil era. Also, while, on the one hand, annual output is forecast to rise steadily in the early 21st century, on the other hand, recovery rates will also improve, through enhanced technology, improved infrastructure and better accessibility. Moreover, there is “unconventional oil”, such as tar sands, oil shale and heavy oil, and exploitation of this is expected to rise steadily in the future. And finally, we have been talking in terms of “proven” reserves. There is still plenty of oil that has yet to be discovered, in regions whose geological structures suggest a high probability of commercially viable reserves.

What we can say with certainty is that there should be plenty of oil around for decades to come. In short, the world’s oil resource base is not a constraint. This is reassuring, because the consensus view is that oil will remain the dominant energy source for the foreseeable future.

Future prospects

The reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model, “OWEM”, sees global oil demand rising by 38 million barrels a day to 115 mb/d by 2025 — annual average growth of 1.6 mb/d, or 1.7 per cent, over the years 2010–25. Oil’s share of the world energy mix will dip slightly during this period, from 40 to 37 per cent.

OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of world oil demand. However, almost three-quarters of the increase in demand of 38 mb/d over the period 2002–25 will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. This will be consistent with the forecast that the average annual economic growth rate of 5.0 per cent for the developing countries will be double the OECD’s 2.5 per cent, for the period up to 2025. Asian countries will remain the key source of oil demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth.

At the global level, the transportation sector accounts for about 60 per cent of the rise in demand in 2000–25. This will amount to nearly all the growth in transition economies, almost four-fifths of it in the OECD and close to half in developing countries. The industrial and household/commercial/agriculture sectors will also be important sources of growth in the developing world.

Turning to the oil supply outlook, in the short-to-medium term, overall non-OPEC supply is expected to continue to increase, rising to a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. This represents an increase of 7–9 mb/d from 2002, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty. The key sources for the increase in non-OPEC supply will be Latin America, Africa, Russia and the Caspian.

With the forecast gradual depletion of non-OPEC reserves in the first quarter of the 21st century, OPEC will increasingly be called upon to supply the incremental barrel. OPEC has both the capability and the will to do this.

Around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves are located in OPEC’s Member Countries, although these 11 states account for only about two-fifths of current world output. Moreover, these reserves are more accessible and cheaper to exploit than those in non-OPEC areas. In 2025, OPEC is projected to meet more than half the world’s oil demand, at 51 per cent, with 58 mb/d.

OPEC is fully aware of the role it will need to play in the evolving international oil market. It is, indeed, an extension of the role it has been playing, with great effect, for many years and which has its roots in the OPEC Statute, which dates from 1961. This important document defines the Organization’s core values of stable markets, reasonable prices, steady revenues, secure supply and fair returns for investors.

Landmark declarations by OPEC in 1968, 1975 and 2000 extended the Organization’s orbit to cover a broader range of issues, including: the inalienable right of all countries to exercise permanent sovereignty over their indigenous natural resources; the promotion of a more equitable global economic system, with particular emphasis on alleviating poverty and other injustices affecting developing countries; sustainable development; and environmental harmony. As you will recall, these incorporate the qualities I outlined earlier, that are considered to be part of the broad-based mandate of the modern petroleum industry.

An important outcome of OPEC’s broader vision was the establishment of its own specialist multilateral development finance institution in 1976, to help other developing countries, especially the least-developed ones, pursue social and economic advancement. To date, the OPEC Fund for International Development has made financial commitments of more than $7.0 bn.

OPEC keeps a close watch, at all times, on energy market developments, as part of its ongoing research activities, at its Vienna-based Secretariat. This covers all reasonable time-horizons — the short term, the medium term and the long term. The purpose is to provide the Organization’s Oil Ministers with the necessary high-quality support material for their decision-making on market issues, whether this be for their short-term production agreements or for their deliberations on important longer-term issues.

One of the most basic issues facing OPEC — and, let us not forget, other oil producers too — is to ensure that sufficient production capacity will be available at all times to help meet the forecast heavy rise in oil demand in the coming years and decades.

Investment is needed: to meet the forecast absolute increase in demand; to see that exhausted reserves are replaced, as and when necessary; and to ensure that oil-producing nations always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply. Also, the oil must be cleaner, safer and more efficient than ever before, to meet the very high expectations of the modern consumer.

Moreover, it is important to note here that, while most people are all-too-familiar with the concept of security of supply, there is also a flip-side to this coin — security of demand. Producers need assurances of stable, predictable markets just as much as consumers require certainty and consistency with supplies.

The required investment will be large, although it will not necessarily be different in magnitude to that observed in the past. Also, the cost of investment in OPEC oil is much lower than in non-OPEC oil.

However, the magnitude of the required capital injection is far from clear, even in the short and medium terms. This is partly due to the wide range of feasible demand growth scenarios, but it is also reinforced by contrasting views on the potential evolution of non-OPEC production. Uncertainties over future economic growth, government policies and the rate of development and diffusion of newer technologies are among the main factors that lie behind this. To illustrate this, if we reduce our global economic growth projections by just one per cent, this will lower the investment requirement for 2010 from a reference case $95 bn to $70 bn — which is a big difference.

To appreciate the significance of all this, one must consider investment lead times that are measured in years rather than months, as well as the importance of “getting it right” i.e. over-investment may result in excessive, costly, idle capacity and under-investment may lead to a shortage of crude and higher prices. In both cases, the losses, especially for producing countries, and the possible, broader associated damage, such as to the world economy, can be huge. Because of the long lead times, it may take years to correct a situation of heavy over- or under-investment.

Clearly, any sound investment strategy must be built upon a solid base. Hence, above and beyond what I have already stated, it is important to have, as a starting-point, market order and stability today, with reasonable prices. This is, sadly, not the case at the present time.

Present challenges

The current market volatility and high prices have been a major cause for concern among OPEC’s Member Countries. Prices for OPEC’s Reference Basket of seven crudes have recently reached record levels. They rose above US $45 a barrel for the first time ever ten days ago; this compares with a fair and reasonable average level of $25.8/b from the inception of the OPEC price band in 2000 through 2003.

We see a combination of factors contributing to the rising price trend this year — even though, throughout, the market has remained well-supplied with crude and fundamentals have been sound: strong economic growth, higher-than-expected oil demand, especially in China and the USA; refining and distribution industry bottlenecks in some major consuming regions, coupled with more stringent product specifications and compounded by the recent hurricanes in the Americas; and the present geopolitical tensions and concern about adequacy of spare capacity to meet possible supply disruptions. Combined, these factors have led to fears about a possible future supply shortage of crude oil, which, in turn, have resulted in increased speculation in the futures markets, with substantial upward pressure on prices.

At the last two Meetings of OPEC’s Ministerial Conference — in Beirut on 3 June and Vienna on 15 September — our Member Countries agreed to raise the Organization’s production ceiling for OPEC-10 (that is, OPEC excluding Iraq) by a total of 3.5 million barrels a day to 27.0 mb/d, with the final increase of 1.0 mb/d coming into effect on 1 November. These decisions were taken, even though OPEC’s assessments had indicated that there was sufficient crude already in the market and that Member Countries were already pumping out levels of crude well above previous ceilings. It was believed that, as well as the actual physical fact of agreeing to these big increase in supply to the market, such actions, in themselves, would also send a powerful psychological signal that OPEC was ready to act in order to help stabilise prices.

A further Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference is scheduled for 10 December in Cairo, to review market developments and, if necessary, adjust the production ceiling agreement accordingly.

With regard to meeting rising demand in the short-to-medium term, OPEC has spare production capacity of around 1.5–2.0 mb/d, which would allow for an immediate additional increase in production. Furthermore, in response to the expected demand growth in the near future, Member Countries have plans in place to further increase capacity by at least 1 mb/d towards the end of this year and through 2005. In addition, plans for additional capacity expansion are available and could be enacted soon; however, this capacity would, typically, become available around 18 months after commencement of this process.

These are all very big issues that we are facing — short term, medium term and long term. And I say “we”, because I am talking about the oil industry as a whole —producers, consumers, governments, the large oil companies, the financial institutions and any other party that has a significant role to play in the general welfare, the effectiveness, the growth and the general evolution of the industry. Market order and stability is a shared responsibility for all parties.

When OPEC makes its production agreements, it does so in the expressed expectation that non-OPEC producers will actively support our measures, since this will make our decisions more effective and we will all benefit from this. When OPEC turns its attention to the future, we envisage this as a collective task for the industry and we seek to get as wide a range of views, opinions, information and data as possible. The challenges facing all of us are too large, too complex and too important to be left to individual, concerned groups.

Big advances in dialogue and cooperation among producers and consumers have been an encouraging feature of the past couple of decades, from large-scale international ministerial gatherings, such as the meetings of the now-institutionalised International Energy Forum, to bilateral or regional contacts that extend across national boundaries. Indeed, the establishment of the Forum’s Secretariat in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia, bears witness to OPEC’s commitment to dialogue and cooperation. Recent years have also witnessed the development of a closer working relationship between OPEC and the International Energy Agency, to exchange ideas and information. We are involved in a series of joint meetings among OPEC and non-OPEC producers — the most recent was held in Oman earlier this month. We also engage in annual dialogue with high-level energy officials and research institutes from China, Japan and South Korea.

OPEC welcomes all of this. The industry is much better-off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of handling, at least, the major issues that concern all parties — such as price stability, security of demand and supply, investment, environmental issues and sustainable development.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

I have tried to provide an overview of the principal issues that we, in OPEC, believe support the present and future viability of the petroleum industry. It is truly a vast and complex business. There is a strong sense of optimism about the future. However, the benefits for the future can only be achieved through the sustained efforts of able, committed, well-directed personnel. Increasingly, this task will fall upon the shoulders of the young professionals who are now entering the industry. People like you, from whatever branch of the industry you may be in — geologists, reservoir engineers, chemical engineers, energy economists, administrators and countless other indispensable professional affiliations. Sound investment in human capital is essential.

We are confident that you will successfully rise to the challenges facing all of us in an increasingly globalised industry, where technology is enabling us to make remarkable advances in every field of activity and where the orderly, equitable provision of cleaner, safer energy services is seen as an integral part of sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and the general, balanced enhancement of mankind.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/349-17-october-2004.html"
"2004-07-29","Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the Indonesian National Committee of the World Energy Council for inviting me to deliver this keynote address on the subject of: “OPEC: vision, mission and development / World oil outlook to 2025”.

From a personal point of view, this is a special honour — and pleasure — for me, because, as the saying goes, “There is no place like home”. Having the opportunity to address an audience in one’s own, beloved, home country, has a particular appeal that cannot be found elsewhere. Among other things, it enables one to equate important issues on the global agenda with the specifics of one’s own domestic circumstances in a more direct and targeted manner than usual.

Added to this is the fact that Indonesia is a proud Member of the OPEC family, joining the Organization in 1962, just two years after its establishment in Baghdad. (Slide 2) Indeed, Indonesia is the only Member of OPEC from this part of the world! All in all, Indonesia and OPEC have been through a lot together over the past four decades, sharing a common vision about many aspects of the world oil industry, and, in the process, we have both grown in expertise, confidence, authority and effectiveness during this period. OPEC’s mission can best be understood by familiarising ourselves with the Organization’s principal objectives, as set out in the OPEC Statute: (Slide 3)

“The Organization shall devise ways and means of ensuring the stabilisation of (oil) prices in international markets, with a view to eliminating harmful and unnecessary fluctuations. Due regard shall be given at all times to the interests of the producing nations and to the necessity of securing: a steady income to the producing countries; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry.”

The fact that the Statute dates from 1961 means that, throughout its existence, OPEC has had as its core values: stable markets, reasonable prices, steady revenues, secure supply and fair returns for investors. But OPEC’s mission does not stop there. (Slide 4)

In 1968, OPEC issued a Declaratory Statement of Petroleum Policy in Member Countries. This referred to the inalienable right, as expressed by the United Nations, of all countries to exercise permanent sovereignty over their natural resources in the interests of their national development. The Declaratory Statement pointed out that this right applied to OPEC Member Countries directly undertaking the exploitation of their own, indigenous exhaustible resources. In 1975, a Conference of OPEC Sovereigns and Heads of State in Algiers adopted a “Solemn Declaration”, which, among other things, embodied a proposal for a New International Economic Order. This aimed at promoting a more equitable global economic system, with particular emphasis on alleviating poverty and other injustices affecting developing countries, by encouraging greater interdependence among nations from the North and the South. This first OPEC Summit led to the establishment of OPEC’s own specialist multilateral development finance institution in 1976, to help other developing countries pursue social and economic advancement. To date, the OPEC Fund for International Development has made total financial commitments of US $7.0 billion. In addition, over the years, our Members have, separately, provided considerable assistance to other developing countries.

At its Second Summit in Caracas, Venezuela, in September 2000, OPEC’s Heads of State and Government reviewed the state of the energy industry, “taking into consideration the rapid pace of change in economic, political, technological and environmental developments, and the challenges and opportunities created by globalisation and liberalisation.” The resulting second Solemn Declaration saw Member Countries reaffirm their commitment to OPEC’s longstanding principles and objectives, “to aim at the preservation and the enhancement of the role oil would play in meeting future world energy demand.” It also accommodated other important issues which had risen to prominence on the international agenda since the First Summit.

Therefore, OPEC’s mission has many sides to it and extends well beyond the confines of the international oil market.

OPEC’s development over the years has been remarkable. (Slide 5) It was founded in September 1960, when five oil-producing, developing countries joined forces to safeguard their legitimate national interests, since they relied almost exclusively on petroleum sales on world markets for the generation of export revenue. This occurred at a time when the international petroleum industry, outside the former Soviet Union, was under the firm grip of the established industrial powers.

Other oil-producing developing countries joined OPEC in the next decade and a half, extending the Organization’s reach from Latin America in the west, across North Africa, West Africa and the Middle East in the centre, to South-East Asia in the east. OPEC is truly an international Organization! Over the past four decades, OPEC has overcome formidable challenges in the constantly evolving international oil market, impacting across the spread of the pricing spectrum and compounded by factors far removed from simple market economics.

We have emerged from this as an Organization with a vast experience of petroleum issues and an acute awareness of the realities and the sensitivities of performing on the world stage. Our production agreements make a major contribution to market stability, to the benefit of producers and consumers alike. This brings us onto the subject of cooperation.

Cooperation lies at the roots of OPEC’s existence. Indeed, OPEC was founded on the premise of cooperation, with its first Conference of 1960 resolving that: (Slide 6) “The principal aim of the Organization shall be the unification of petroleum policies for the Member Countries and the determination of the best means for safeguarding the interests of Member Countries, individually and collectively.”

The crude oil price collapse of 1986 and its damaging economic repercussions encouraged many non-OPEC producers to respond to OPEC’s calls for enhanced cooperation, as they finally recognised what we had been saying for years — that the oil market was inherently unstable and that some form of supervision was required to help achieve and maintain order and stability. (Slide 7) Since the late 1980s, the support of leading non-OPEC producers has, on many occasions, increased the effectiveness of our market-stabilisation measures.

The benefits of cooperation extend into many other areas of the oil industry’s activities. For example, in July 2003, we held a productive joint one-day workshop on the short- and long-term prospects for the development of world oil markets, with high-powered delegations from the Russian Federation. Moreover, there were major advances in producer-consumer dialogue in the 1990s, in tandem with the rising profile of the International Energy Forum. (Slide 8) OPEC has played a prominent role in the development of this specialist producer-consumer forum; among other things, its new permanent Secretariat has been located in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia.

Recent years have witnessed the development of a closer working relationship between OPEC and the International Energy Agency, to exchange ideas and information. Two Joint Workshops on Oil Investment Prospects have been a product of this, while, last year, informal discussions between our two organisations helped stabilise the oil market at the time of the Iraq war. Clearly, the concept of cooperation within the world oil industry is now well-established (Slide 9) — although such is the complexity of this industry and the underlying forces and pressures that propel it, that there remains plenty of scope for improvement. Nevertheless, a clear realisation has emerged that the industry is better-off if there is an underlying consensus on the means of handling, at least, the major issues that concern all parties — such as pricing, stability, security of demand and supply, investment, environmental issues and sustainable development.

This is all very welcome and is helping the industry prepare to meet the challenges that face it both now and in the future.

Let us now look at today’s oil market. (Slide 10)

The present high oil prices are a matter of much concern to OPEC, and we are doing everything we can to restore order and stability to the market, in the interests of producers and consumers alike. However, the high prices are occurring in spite of the market remaining well-supplied with crude and despite the continued efforts of our Member Countries to meet market requirements. OPEC is producing at close to capacity and has made significant increases in output. Our most recent assessment shows that OPEC-10 is currently producing some 2 mb/d above the agreed output ceiling. This should not, however, be seen as a violation of our production agreement; instead, it should be recognised as constituting a positive response by our Members to the current market situation. It should be clear from our actions that the Organization does not wish to see prices rise any further. Even the US Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, acknowledged last week that oil prices were high because demand was expanding faster than supply, and not because OPEC was squeezing the market. He was quoted as saying that, even though there was an obvious incentive for them to do so, OPEC countries were not trying to increase prices because of the dollar’s recent decline. So what has been putting such strong upward pressure on prices this year? It has, in fact, been a combination of factors, including: higher-than-expected oil demand growth, especially in China and the USA; geopolitical tensions; and refining and distribution industry bottlenecks in some major consuming regions, coupled with more stringent product specifications. Combined, these factors have led to unwarranted fears about a possible future supply shortage of crude oil, which, in turn, have resulted in increased speculation in the futures markets, with substantial upward pressure on prices. Indeed, demand growth projections for 2004 are being continually revised up; since this time last year, they have more than doubled to around 2 mb/d, which represents a 16-year high.

At the Extraordinary Meeting of the OPEC Conference in Beirut on 3 June, in the light of the prevailing high, volatile prices, we decided to increase OPEC-10’s production ceiling in two stages — by two million barrels a day to 25.5 mb/d, with effect from 1 July, and by a further 500,000 b/d to 26.0 mb/d, with effect from 1 August. We did this to ensure adequate supply, to send a clear signal of OPEC’s commitment to market stability and to restoring prices to levels acceptable to both producers and consumers, and to support continued, robust, global economic growth. At the same time, we once again called on all other parties, including non-OPEC producers and consumers, to support our actions and to take appropriate measures to address the challenges facing the industry. Although the price of OPEC’s Reference Basket fell by more than US $3 a barrel in the weeks after the Beirut Conference, they began to rise again at the beginning of this month, indicating that the principal elements that concerned us in Beirut are still with us today, in what has continued to be a nervous, sensitive market.

We in OPEC recognise that this is a challenging time in the oil market, with the unusual, powerful combination of forces that are currently dominating market activity and adversely affecting its equilibrium. However, we remain firm in our resolve to continue doing everything we can to restore prices to reasonable levels, that are acceptable to producers and consumers alike — and to keep them there. We successfully operated our price band mechanism for three years and we have every intention of ensuring its return to full effectiveness as soon as we can — but this is, of course, difficult in the present exceptional circumstances. Turning our attention to 2005, initial forecasts from recognised sources for next year assume a moderate slowdown in global economic growth. (Slide 11) We project an annual growth rate of 4.3 per cent for 2005, compared with the 4.8 per cent currently forecast for this year. Growth of 5.1 per cent for developing countries will compare with 3.0 per cent for the OECD. Separately, China is projected to experience 7.7 per cent growth in 2005, and Russia 5.7 per cent. (Slide 12)

What impact will this have on oil demand in 2005 — especially at a time when there may be attempts to fill strategic petroleum reserves in China, India and, possibly, the USA? (Slide 13) Oil demand growth forecasts for 2005 fall within a wide range of 1.4–2.4 mb/d, with an average of around 1.8 mb/d. OPEC itself projects 1.7 mb/d. Asia is expected to account for a significant proportion of this growth. (Slide 14)

Looking at supply, forecasts for 2005 non-OPEC supply (which, in this short-term analysis, includes OPEC NGLs) also cover a wide range, between 0.7 mb/d and 1.6 mb/d, with a mean of about 1.0 mb/d. (Slide 15) OPEC’s projections see an increase of 1.3 mb/d. According to various sources, the difference between world oil demand and non-OPEC supply is expected to increase for the third consecutive year. The preliminary market balance forecasts — demand minus non-OPEC supply — are also spread across a wide range, from 27.4 mb/d to 29.4 mb/d, with an average of around 28.4 mb/d. OPEC expects this number to fall at the low end of the range. (Slide 16)

Will OPEC be able to meet the projected additional call on its oil in 2005? Historically, our Organization has maintained adequate excess production capacity to provide a timely response to supply disruptions and/or surges in demand, such as those experienced in the last few years. We are confident that this trend will be repeated in 2005. After all, in addition to opening their taps in response to market demand so far this year, OPEC’s Member Countries have also been investing vast resources to increase production capacity in the near term. We think it is reasonable to assume that OPEC’s spare capacity will lie within a range of 2.8–3.5 mb/d next year, and this will provide a sufficient buffer to ease the pressure on prices from concern about potential supply disruptions or other unexpected developments. (Slide 17)

Let us now look further into the future, to 2025. Here we rely heavily upon OPEC’s World Energy Model, “OWEM”, and the reference case from its latest scenarios report, which was prepared at the beginning of this year, before the recent big rise in oil prices. The early part of this period sees the Reference Basket at $25/b, while the longer-term figure, in real terms, settles at $20/b, at 2003 prices. (Slide 18) The early decades of the 21st century are expected to see fossil fuels account predominantly for increases in world energy demand, with oil continuing to maintain its major role. There is also a clear expectation that the oil resource base is sufficiently abundant to satisfy this demand growth. (Slide 19)

Our reference case sees average annual world economic growth of 3.6 per cent over the period 2003–25, with the most rapid rates being in the developing countries, particularly China, which has a projected figure of 6.4 per cent. (Slide 20) The average annual rate of 5.0 per cent for the developing countries is double the OECD’s 2.5 per cent, for the period up to 2025.

Our reference case sees global oil demand rising by 12 million barrels a day to 89 mb/d from 2002 to 2010 (Slide 21) — an average annual growth rate of 1.5 mb/d, or 1.8 per cent per annum. Further increases in the following decade will see demand grow by another 17 mb/d to 106 mb/d by 2020, and then by 9 mb/d to 115 mb/d by 2025 — an average of 1.7 per cent p.a. growth over the years 2010–25.

OECD countries will continue to account for the largest share of oil demand. However, almost three-quarters of the increase in demand of 38 mb/d over the period 2002–25 will come from developing countries, whose consumption will almost double. (Slide 22) Asian countries will remain the key source of demand increase in the developing world, with China and India central to this growth. At the global level, the transportation sector accounts for about 60 per cent of the rise in demand in 2000–25. (Slide 23) This will amount to nearly all the growth in transition economies, almost four-fifths of it in the OECD and close to half in developing countries. The industrial and household/commercial/agriculture sectors will also be important sources of growth in the developing world. Turning to the oil supply outlook, in the short-to-medium term, on the basis of detailed bottom-up data on upstream development plans, overall non-OPEC supply is expected to continue to increase, rising to a plateau of 55–57 mb/d in the post-2010 period. (Slide 24) This represents an increase of 7–9 mb/d from 2002, although the eventual scale of this future expansion is subject to considerable uncertainty. The key sources for the increase in non-OPEC supply will be Latin America, Africa, Russia and the Caspian.

In the longer term, the balance of the global oil reserve base and the gradual depletion of non-OPEC reserves means that OPEC will increasingly be called upon to supply the incremental barrel, with its market share eventually set to rise. (Slide 25) By 2020, with a production level, including natural gas liquids, of 49 mb/d, OPEC’s share will be 46 per cent of the market. Five years later, in 2025, OPEC is projected to meet more than half the world’s oil demand, at 51 per cent, with 58 mb/d.

Clearly there is a need for increased investment in oil production capacity. This has three elements to it. (Slide 26) First, it must meet the forecast absolute increase in demand, which I outlined earlier. Secondly, it must see that exhausted reserves are replaced, as and when necessary. And thirdly — and this is a recently articulated concept, but, nevertheless, a very important concept — it must ensure that oil-producing nations always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply.

However, the magnitude of the required capital injection is far from clear, even in the short and medium terms. This is partly due to the wide range of feasible demand growth scenarios, but it is also reinforced by contrasting views on the potential evolution of non-OPEC production. Uncertainties over future economic growth, government policies and the rate of development and diffusion of newer technologies are among the main factors that lie behind this. (Slide 27)

Even a one per cent shift in global economic growth expectations can make a big difference to required production capacity levels — and hence investment requirements — in a relatively short time. Our calculations, based on OWEM scenarios, show that a one per cent reduction in global economic growth projections reduces the investment requirement for 2010 from a reference case $95 billion to $70 bn and, for just five years later, from $173 bn to $122 bn. (Slide 28) These are very big and, indeed, very significant differences. After all, under-investment will lead to a shortage of crude and over-investment will lead to excessive, costly idle capacity. Neither is good, and both can have a serious, detrimental impact on market stability and prices.

And when a miscalculation occurs, it is by no means an overnight task correcting the situation, due to the long lead-times involved in investment in the petroleum sector. We can easily find ourselves talking in terms of years, when it comes to making the appropriate adjustments to production capacity levels which are found to be out of line with the market’s requirements. Countering uncertainties, therefore, becomes a very important task and, to be truly effective, requires a collective approach from within the industry, since the challenges are too large, too complex and too important to be left to partial interests. This requires transparency, consultation, meticulous planning and careful scheduling by all parties.

One certainty, however, is the clear economic advantage that lies in investing in the exploitation of OPEC’s crude oil reserves. Not only are these reserves more abundant, accounting for around four-fifths of the world’s proven total, but they are also more accessible and cheaper to exploit than those in non-OPEC areas. (Slide 29) Also, as we noted earlier, our projections show that OPEC will increasingly be called upon to supply the incremental barrel. Moreover, it is worth noting that the absolute size of investment required by the oil industry in this outlook is not necessarily different in magnitude to that observed in the past. This should all be viewed as good news for the industry and for world energy supply generally.

However, the conditions have to be right to ensure that this oil is brought to the market in an efficient, effective and timely manner. One of the clear messages to emerge from the second joint OPEC/IEA workshop in April was that the starting-point for a sound investment strategy is market order and stability today. (Slide 30) A reasonable, predictable price level is needed to secure adequate sources of investment. That is why OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures and, in particular, its price band concept are so important.

It is also why it is necessary for other producers to recognise that they share with us the collective responsibility for enhancing the overall welfare of the international oil market and that they must take active steps, whenever they can, to support our measures. (Slide 31) All producers stand to benefit from cooperation, on all time-horizons. Indeed, there must be reasonable burden-sharing among all parties in the industry, including the large oil companies, financial institutions and other intermediary bodies, if the industry is going to develop in an orderly manner in the future and meet the sizeable challenges facing it.

Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, Let us end on a bright note! As I have made clear during this speech, there is the clear expectation that the world’s oil resource base is sufficiently abundant to satisfy the steady rise in demand that has been forecast for the years and decades ahead. (Slide 32) And OPEC, upon which the world will rely increasingly for its oil, has the mission and the commitment to ensure that this demand is met in an orderly manner, with stable markets, reasonable prices, steady revenues, secure supply and fair returns for investors.

"2004-06-13","World oil demand is forecast to continue growing, to almost 50 per cent above the 2002 level in 2025. Asia has the fastest demand growth and will benefit increasingly from oil coming from outside the region. There are enough oil reserves, especially in OPEC, to meet rising world demand for decades ahead. The long-term picture points to the need for increased investment in production capacity, but the magnitude of this is very uncertain, with a wide range of feasible demand growth scenarios. Market stability is key to a sound base for investment. Dialogue and cooperation among producers — OPEC and non-OPEC — and consumers are required to ensure that the world’s rising demand is met in a full, timely and stable manner.

Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organiser, Petronas, for inviting me to be a panel member at this plenary session on OPEC and non-OPEC.

It is essential for all producers — OPEC and non-OPEC — to play their part to the full in ensuring that the world’s growing thirst for oil is always met in a complete and timely manner. This involves a readiness to enter into dialogue and cooperation at all times on important major issues affecting the industry, both now and in the future.

It is widely forecast that there will be a substantial rise in world oil demand in the coming years. However, the industry has the resource base to meet this demand.

Projections from OPEC’s World Energy Model see world oil demand rising from 77 million barrels a day in 2002 to 115 mb/d in 2025 — an annual average growth rate of 1.7 per cent.

The fastest growth will occur in Asia (in this analysis, Asia excludes the Middle East and OECD countries). Our figures show annual average growth of 3.1 per cent in South-East Asia, 4.4 per cent in China and an exceptional 5.5 per cent in South Asia during this period.

However, this rapid growth in Asia and China is not matched by production. On the contrary, oil production in Asia, including China, actually falls, marginally, from 5.7 mb/d in 2002 to 5.6 mb/d in 2025. Asia, therefore, will benefit increasingly from supplies from outside the region.

Our projections show an 18 per cent rise in world oil output from non-OPEC countries in 2002–25, mainly from Russia, the Caspian and Africa. But this is still around 30 percentage points less than the projected growth in demand. Therefore, there will be a substantial rise in the call on OPEC oil in the opening decades of the 21st century. We see this doubling, from 29 mb/d in 2002 to 58 mb/d in 2025.

Our Member Countries have sufficient reserves to cope with the rising demand. Our proven crude oil reserves total nearly 850 billion barrels, which is almost 80 per cent of the world total, and these should be sufficient to see us well into the second half of the 21st century. What is more, OPEC’s reserves are low-cost and highly accessible.

There is, therefore, a considerable challenge facing oil producers — OPEC and non-OPEC — to ensure that the oil requirement is constantly satisfied in a full and timely manner.

Fortunately, much progress has been made in recent years in the area of dialogue and cooperation among producers and this has resulted in a very welcome, steadily growing sense of collective responsibility for the state of the market. The benefits of this can be felt throughout the industry, not only upstream, but also downstream, including transportation and distribution. Indeed, it has become widely acknowledged that the downstream industry should feature prominently in our assessments both now and in the future, so as to avoid it becoming a source of price volatility.

Nevertheless, some shortcomings remain with the present environment for cooperation. For example, there is an element of crisis management about the willingness of some parties to cooperate with OPEC over its market-stabilisation measures, when, in fact, there should also be a “sunny day” element, so that this very welcome and very necessary support remains even when the market is stable. This is because the market can quickly slip from stable to unstable, as we all know, and the stronger the sustained defence mechanisms, then the more effective we will be in handling such situations.

The increased cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC producers has been accompanied by important advances in producer-consumer dialogue since the early 1990s. This has found special expression in the meetings of the International Energy Forum, which has become an established institution during this period, with its secretariat situated in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia.

There has also been the development of a closer working relationship between OPEC and the International Energy Agency, to exchange ideas and information. Last year, informal discussions between our two organisations helped stabilise the market at the time of the Iraq war. And, two months ago, we held our Second Joint Workshop on Oil Investment Prospects in Paris. At that workshop, one of the clear messages to emerge was that the starting-point for a sound investment strategy is market order and stability today. This vindicates longstanding OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures and the support they have received from many non-OPEC producers. The state of today’s market will have an influence upon the state of tomorrow’s market. Stability today is conducive to stability tomorrow.

However, in contrast with this requirement, considerable difficulty is created by the large areas of uncertainty that exist today. These are associated with, for example, future levels of oil demand, policy developments and technological advances. Clearly, their existence impedes efforts to make reasonable forecasts about the future oil requirement, especially in view of the long lead times that exist in the industry.

Countering these uncertainties can only be done effectively by a collective approach from within the industry, since the challenges are too large, too complex and too important to be left to partial interests. This requires transparency, consultation, meticulous planning and careful scheduling by all parties.

However, all producers stand to gain from cooperation, on all time-horizons. But there must be reasonable burden-sharing among them. Also, the large oil companies, financial institutions and other intermediary bodies are an integral part of this process and their views and expertise make a major contribution to dialogue and the running of the industry.

Effective dialogue and cooperation among all the major parties are of particular importance during the present period of high oil prices, which are occurring in spite of the the market remaining well-supplied with crude at all times and despite the continued efforts of our Member Countries to meet market requirements. A variety of factors is at work here, including: higher-than-expected oil demand growth, especially in China and the USA; geopolitical tensions; refining and distribution industry bottlenecks in some major consuming regions; and, as a consequence of this combination of factors, increased speculation in futures markets. At our Conference in Beirut on 3 June, we decided to give a clear signal of our commitment to market stability and to maintaining prices at acceptable levels for both producers and consumers, by raising the OPEC production ceiling by 2.5 mb/d, in a two-stage move to be completed by 1 August. At the same time, we, once again, called on all other parties, including non-OPEC producers and consumers, to support our actions and to take appropriate measures to address the challenges facing the industry. Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me conclude with one general comment. The world cannot afford to behave irresponsibly and squander its finite petroleum reserves. OPEC and non-OPEC producers are, in effect, custodians of these God-given minerals and we have a duty to ensure that they are exploited in a responsible manner, to the benefit of the global community, today and in the years ahead. We are doing everything we can, in OPEC, to abide by this mandate.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/351-13-june-2004.html"
"2004-06-08","Big reductions in carbon dioxide emissions are possible with the continued use of petroleum, through the application of a technology that is being developed today, CO2 capture and sequestration.

This was the overriding message to emerge from a workshop held in OPEC’s Secretariat in Vienna, Austria, on 8–9 July. However, it was acknowledged that there was a need to reduce the cost of applying this technology, before it was able to realise its full potential.

The two-day workshop was organised jointly by OPEC and the World Petroleum Congress, and its theme was carbon capture and storage, CO2 for enhanced oil recovery, and gas flaring reduction.

Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and stationary industrial sources account for more than 60 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. However, this CO2 can be captured and stored, and, if injected into depleting oil reservoirs, can increase recovery through an “enhanced oil recovery” (EOR) process. Thus, CO2 capture and storage and EOR present opportunities for the oil industry to participate in activities that will substantially reduce emissions, and, in the case of EOR, increase the recovery from oil fields.

Gas flaring, another source of greenhouse gas emissions, can be practically eliminated in oil field operations by utilisation of the gas for re-injection, as fuel for power generation, and/or for poverty reduction programmes that are focused on bringing modern energy supplies to the least developed areas of the world, consistent with the principles of sustainable development.

The emphasis in the workshop was on the application of the latest technology towards meeting these carbon-based challenges. The overall objective of the meeting was to bring added value to oil and gas operations in oil-producing countries, while presenting a proactive response to environmental concerns.

The workshop brought together international energy experts from government, intergovernmental organisations, industry, academia, research institutes and regulatory bodies, as well as OPEC’s own Member Countries.

“Today, we find ourselves having to operate in an industry that is increasingly subject to carbon constraints, in the light of the longstanding United Nations-sponsored climate change negotiations,” said Dr Maizar Rahman, Acting for the OPEC Secretary General.

He was referring to the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Under the Protocol, which has yet to be ratified, 38 developed countries agreed to collectively cut back their greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, by a total of 5.2 per cent between 2008 and 2012 from 1990 levels. It authorised three “Kyoto mechanisms” to be used to meet binding quantitative emissions reductions targets — the “clean development mechanism”, “emissions trading” and “joint implementation”.

“We must, therefore, envisage (the evolving situation) as presenting a new set of challenges to all those involved in running the oil industry,” continued Dr Rahman, who is also Indonesia’s Governor for OPEC. “This must be integrated into the way we handle what may be considered as the overriding challenge facing the industry, which is to meet, in a timely and effective manner, the rising level of oil demand that has been forecast for the 21st century.”

A new scenario is unfolding, in the shape of a world that requires its energy to be cleaner, safer and, as far as possible, environmentally benign — and yet, at the same time, wants its energy to be as cheap as possible and to reap the full benefit of any other economies that may be within its reach.

“The industry must ensure that it continues its efforts to address environmental problems in the future,” Dr Rahman said. “This process involves the constant willingness to reappraise our outlook, our targets, our methodologies and our practices and procedures at all stages of our operations. To carry this out effectively, a collective approach is essential that extends right across the industry.” That was why the workshop was being held, to explore possible avenues for cooperation.

The WPC President, Dr Eivald Røren, noted how the aims of the workshop equated to the Congress’s central objective of “promoting the management of the world’s petroleum resources. It aims to encourage the application of scientific and technological advances and the study of economic, financial, management, environmental and social issues relating to the petroleum industry.” He stressed the importance of “good housekeeping” within the industry and the need for producers to be able to say to their children and their grandchildren: “We have done our best.”

He said it was in the “enlightened self-interest” of producers to ensure the capture, storage and use of CO2, as well as to avoid wastage with flaring gas. Sustainable practices were essential.

As the opening session of the meeting got under way, the first speaker emphasised that the industry must actively promote such practices.

Bob Card, President of the USA-based consultancy, The Card Group, observed that — from an American perspective — since certain groups wanted to eliminate the use of fossil fuels altogether, this could be countered: “By credibly pursuing, and then implementing, carbon capture and storage technology, producers can counter this trend, thereby protecting their market and product returns.”

He stressed the importance of producers of doing everything they could to get this point across to policy-makers, by ensuring that they had “a seat at the table” whenever significant new legislation affecting the petroleum industry was under consideration, so that the interests of the industry could be properly addressed and articulated.

It was pointed out that, even though carbon capture and storage technology was available today, the costs were relatively high. In response to this, large-scale international research and development ventures were already underway, to help enhance the technology and bring down costs.

A series of presentations on commercial-scale demonstration projects illustrated this.

They began with two case studies on the injection of captured CO2 into saline aquifers, the In Salah Project in Algeria and the Sleipner Project in Norway. In both projects, participants heard that the CO2 that was removed from a natural gas sales stream was being injected into saline aquifers, rather than being vented to the atmosphere.

Case studies on CO2 enhanced oil recovery featured the Weyburn demonstration project in Canada, which used captured CO2 from a gasification plant, and the West Texas Permian Basin projects, which relied upon naturally occurring CO2 from reservoirs. It was stated that, with the Weyburn project, the field response to the CO2 injection was so positive that the project was economic on its own at a price of US $18 a barrel. In West Texas, where CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects had been conducted for more than 30 years, EOR now accounted for 20 per cent of total oil production and some fields would achieve ultimate recoveries of nearly 70 per cent.

Discussions of the policy and regulatory issues revealed that legal frameworks still had to be developed for CO2 capture and storage, in particular concerning the long-term safety and monitoring of CO2 capture. The use of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism had been discussed and a methodology for a North Sea CO2 capture and storage project was presented as a first step.

In the ensuing round table discussion, under the chairmanship of OPEC’s Director of Research, Dr Adnan Shihab-Eldin, it was emphasised that a good and thorough understanding of the technology and the costs was essential before policy decisions could be made.

Also, carbon dioxide had to be “given a price”. It should not be considered as being free. Consumers had to be prepared to take a share of the burden of paying for carbon-mitigation measures.

It was pointed out that the potential for commercial-scale EOR provided the incentive for oil producers to become involved in CO2 capture. Many had already recognised that it was a “win-win” situation for them.

For mature fields in the USA, CO2 enhanced oil recovery had been so successful that producers were considering the use of anthropogenic CO2 to expand this process to other fields.

Indeed, the present high oil prices had encouraged some commercial banks to consider financing EOR projects in the USA. It was noted in the discussions that enhanced oil recovery was economic at a technically feasible cost of $22/tonne of CO2, when the price of West Texas Intermediate crude was $40/barrel.

During the second day of the workshop, participants focused their attention on gas flaring, which presented another set of challenges for the oil industry, both on economic grounds and due to its polluting impact on local communities. However, the pace and extent of developments varied significantly among oil-producing regions.

The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company had achieved dramatic reductions in gas flaring, from about 1,500 million cubic feet per day (mcf/d) in the early 1980s to less than 200 mcf/d today. This had reduced air pollution and increased gas availability for export or internal use.

In Alaska, gas flaring was illegal, and so all produced gas had been re-injected. In the Prudhoe Bay field, gas re-injection projects had increased reserves by 5.5 billion barrels of oil, participants heard, and today gas cap liquids constituted 50 per cent of production. The re-injection of produced gas had also contributed to the 36 trillion cubic feet of gas that was now available for export.

Algeria had spent $600 million on gas flaring reduction projects since 1973, reducing gas flaring from 84 per cent of associated gas production to about 11 per cent today. The national oil company, Sonatrach, planned to reduce this to zero by 2010, primarily through re-injection.

In Nigeria, 42 per cent of the associated gas was flared, down from the 62 per cent in 2000. The Italian oil company, ENI, was developing a gas-gathering system and an independent power plant. Since the power plant will burn associated gas that might otherwise be flared, it was being considered for credit as a Clean Development Mechanism project.

However, in spite of all these developments, it was made clear, in the round table discussions that concluded the two-day meeting, that there were remaining hurdles to be overcome.

Many of these were economic or financial in scope and included differences between internal and export gas prices, the lack of gas-gathering systems for small volumes of gas and the remote locations of some of the fields.

Moreover, there was the social dimension, participants heard. In some areas, it was recognised that reducing or eradicating flaring could provide much-needed access to energy for local communities, as well as providing them with a healthier environment in which to live. There was also the view that regional cooperation is essential. As an example, Nigeria and Algeria are discussing cooperation on a trans-African pipeline to take associated gas to the European market.

Dr. Sascha Djumena from the World Bank outlined the bank’s active involvement in helping to reduce flaring and the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Public Private Partnership (GGFR). Many OPEC Member Countries are already part of the GGFR.

He said the GGFR and the World Bank were committed to developing an efficient regulatory framework and adequate fiscal incentives, as well as providing advice on implementing standards, on the potential role of carbon credits and on the commercialisation of associated gas.

As the workshop drew to a close, speakers emphasised the importance of continuing “the spirit of cooperation generated by the workshop when we return to our home countries”, to contribute positively to the “achievement of objectives discussed in this room”.

Dr Rahman closed the workshop with the following comment: “What we have now is the understanding that, regarding CO2 sequestration, storage and use, as well as gas flaring, all parties, in fact, have the same interests and objectives. There is also an understanding that cooperation and synergy between all parties are necessary to realise those objectives.”","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/352-8-june-2004.html"
"2004-04-29","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by expressing the regrets of the President and Secretary General of OPEC, HE Dr Purnomo Yusgiantoro, who is unable to attend the 5th International Oil Summit personally. Dr Purnomo, who is also Indonesia’s Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, has asked me to speak to you on his behalf on the topic of “Oil and the challenges of the 21st century”. He has directed me to convey his thanks to the organisers for this kind invitation and wishes all those involved every success with the Summit.

As we settle into the new century, we are beginning to get a clearer image of the challenges that will face the oil industry in the coming years and decades. There is broad consensus on the projection that energy demand will continue rising in an era of increasing globalisation, rapid communications and continued advances in technology, but that consumers will want this energy to be as clean and as safe as possible, as well as integrating itself fully into their plans for sustainable development and economic growth.

There is also consensus on the contention that, of the world’s five main commercial energy sources, oil will maintain its present leading role well into the 21st century.

Currently, oil accounts for around 40 per cent of the energy mix. This is because it is a unique commodity, with a combination of attributes which far exceeds that of any other energy source — sufficiency, accessibility, versatility, ease of transport and, in many areas, low costs. These have been complemented by a multitude of practical benefits that can be gained from decades of intensive exploitation and use in the industrial, commercial and domestic fields. Also, advances in technology continue to make oil a cleaner, safer fuel, so that it can meet increasingly tighter environmental regulations, as well as conforming to the broader demands of sustainable development.

The world’s proven crude oil reserves total around 1,100 billion barrels, which, in simplistic terms, will be enough to meet demand for around 45 years, at current production rates.

Oil will remain the dominant energy source, in spite of the fact that, over the past decade or so, it has come under pressure on environmental grounds, particularly in the context of the UN-sponsored climate change negotiations. This has come on top of longer-standing efforts among some consuming nations to diversify energy sources away from it, on so-called “strategic grounds”.

Projections from the reference case of OPEC’s World Energy Model, “OWEM”, suggest only a marginal dip to 38 per cent in oil’s market share in the period to 2020. In absolute terms, world oil demand is forecast to rise from 76 million barrels a day in 2000 to 106 mb/d in 2020 — that is, by around 39 per cent.

The closest rival to oil during this period will be its fellow hydrocarbon, gas, which has a more favourable environmental profile. However, our reference case shows that, even though the use of gas will almost double in the period 2000–20 and its share in the global energy mix will rise from 23 per cent to 28 per cent, this will still be ten percentage points below the share of oil. So there is a very positive outlook for oil in the foreseeable future. It will be the task of the oil industry, therefore, to ensure that oil realises its full potential on world energy markets in the years and decades to come.

While this is a task which should be handled on an equitable basis by all parties in the market, quite clearly a heavy burden will fall upon OPEC producers. This is partly because of our Member Countries’ strong resource base and partly because of our successful track record with market-stabilisation measures.

Our Member Countries possess around 80 per cent of the world’s proven crude oil reserves — totalling nearly 850 billion barrels — and there is a reserves-to-production ratio of more than 80 years. These reserves are much more economic to access than those in other, high-cost regions of the world. Therefore, our Member Countries have the reserve strength to cope with the forecast rises in demand in the coming decades.

OPEC has demonstrated repeatedly its commitment to achieving order and stability in the international oil market. Our production policies seek to ensure that the market is well-supplied with crude at all times and that oil prices remain at levels that meet the contrasting needs of producers and consumers. The limits of our oil price band — US $22–28 per barrel for our Reference Basket — have been carefully calculated with this in mind. If we find that prices are beginning to settle outside this range, or if, at one of our Ministerial Conferences, we are convinced that this is very likely to occur in the coming months, then we will reassess our Organization’s production ceiling and adjust it accordingly.

We take a great deal of care in doing this, and sometimes the conclusions we reach about a particular market situation are not immediately understood by all the other parties involved. A case in point has occurred over the past six months, at a time when average monthly prices have remained above our band. The fact that we have decided to implement a production cut of 1 mb/d, with effect from the beginning of this month, is due to our recognition, first, that the present high prices are not being caused by a shortage of crude and, secondly, that we are entering the second quarter of the year, when demand is traditionally low. Our concern has been that, in a market that is so easily influenced by psychological factors, we could suddenly find ourselves in a situation where there is the widespread realisation of substantial excess supply and that this dramatically drives down prices well below the minimum level of our band — as has occurred often in the past, a downward price trend can effectively feed on itself in a nervous, speculative market atmosphere and create its own damaging momentum. We would end up in a situation where prices would be well below fundamental levels, in just the same way that they are now above fundamental levels. The net result would be rampant volatility and this would be to no one’s ultimate advantage. It is, therefore, better to take preventive measures now, rather than wait until a major crisis occurs, when it would be much more difficult to remedy the situation. This is in line with the principal philosophy behind OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures.

To illustrate the success of our market-stabilisation measures, one need only look at the relatively high degree of price stability that has existed in the market in the opening years of this century, bearing in mind the chequered history of our industry. Early last year, for example, there was a three-pronged threat to price stability, with the crises that prevailed in Iraq, Nigeria and Venezuela, and yet, the market weathered the storm without major disruption and volatility, and this was very much due to the support it received from OPEC’s policies. Indeed, the first three full years in which OPEC’s price band policy was applied — 2001–03 — saw prices average $25.2/b, which was right in the middle of the band.

Let us not forget that the international oil market is inherently unstable — as history has taught us repeatedly — and that some form of stabilising activity is required, due to the colossal negative repercussions that price volatility can have throughout the world economy. Witness the events of the 1970s, 1986, late 1998/early 1999. A sound global economy is dependent upon stable energy prices. Sound national economies are dependent upon stable energy prices. Sound company finances are dependent upon stable energy prices. Crude oil accounts for 40 per cent of the global energy mix. If oil is jittery, energy will be jittery!

We have demonstrated in OPEC that it is possible to provide a high degree of stability in an inherently volatile environment. And the beauty of this — if it is done well — is that everybody gains! OPEC, non-OPEC, producers, consumers …

This is why we have called upon other parties in the industry to cooperate with OPEC in our market-stabilisation measures. We have been fairly successful in this over the past decade or so, as other responsible members of the international petroleum community have come to realise the universal benefits of such actions. Indeed, the success of our production agreements has depended heavily upon the support they have received from elsewhere in the industry.

Again, the situation is not a perfect one. There is still an element of crisis management about the willingness of some parties to cooperate with OPEC, when, in fact, there should also be a “sunny day” element, so that this very welcome and very necessary support remains even when the market is stable. This is because the market can quickly slip from stable to unstable, as we all know, and the stronger the defence mechanisms — the sustained defence mechanisms — then the more effective we will be in handling such situations.

But there is also a bigger issue at stake.

This is the fact that a stable, orderly oil market today provides the essential base for a stable, orderly oil market tomorrow — or, less poetically, in the years ahead. We believe, in OPEC, that it is the duty of all parties in the industry to ensure that the market meets not only today’s needs, but also copes in full measure with demand five or ten years ahead. In other words, I am talking about investment — investment in future production capacity. The starting-point for a sound investment strategy is order and stability today.

Investment in the oil industry has three elements to it. First, it must meet the forecast absolute increase in demand, which I outlined earlier. Secondly, it must see that exhausted reserves are replaced, as and when necessary. And thirdly — and this is a recently articulated concept, but, nevertheless, a very important concept — it must ensure that oil-producing nations always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply.

We are talking about enormous sums of money here. Our projections indicate that OPEC Member Countries may need to spend nearly $100 bn by 2010 and as much as $200 bn by 2020 to meet the future demand for oil in full. The estimates for non-OPEC producers are multiples of this. It will require a concerted effort by the industry at large to attract these sums. This is perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing us today.

Here we find ourselves up against many obstacles. There are huge areas of uncertainty affecting the clarity and consistency of future world oil demand, and, clearly, the magnitude of these uncertainties increases as we venture further into the future. These uncertainties include changing regulations, fiscal regimes, strategic and political factors, evolving life-styles, natural disasters and, of course, human error. Countering these uncertainties requires transparency, consultation, meticulous planning and careful scheduling across the industry.

In conclusion, therefore, the challenges facing the oil industry in the 21st century are formidable and extend across all time-horizons. The world has enough crude oil to meet growing consumer needs throughout the early decades of the century, at least, and most of this resides within the borders of OPEC’s Member Countries. It is up to all of us to ensure that these finite resources are exploited in an efficient, effective and equitable manner both now and in the future, so that the world community at large can derive the maximum benefit from them.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/353-29-april-2004.html"
"2004-04-28","Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by expressing, on behalf of the OPEC Secretary General, HE Dr Purnomo Yusgiantoro — who is also President of the OPEC Conference and Indonesia’s Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources — our sincere thanks to Mr Mandil and his colleagues for the highly professional manner in which they have organised this workshop and for their generous hospitality. We are pleased to have had the chance to renew old friendships, as well as establish new ones.

It seems like only yesterday that our two organisations held our first-ever joint workshop on a theme of mutual interest, namely oil investment prospects. In fact, ten months have passed since that historic occasion, which we had the honour of hosting at our Secretariat in Vienna. Now it is the turn of our counterparts at the International Energy Agency to perform this weighty, but worthy task at their headquarters in Paris.

The investment landscape for our discussions this year remains very similar to the investment landscape of last year. There have, without doubt, been developments since June 2003 which have had the potential to affect the investment profile — influenced by emerging trends and events in different parts of the energy world — but these are of minor significance to our overall calculations when we are looking ten, 20 or even 30 years ahead. However, the international community’s understanding of this complex and challenging landscape has improved during this period, thanks in part to the work of our two organisations.

Last year’s workshop demonstrated that there is common understanding on many of the important issues that lie before us, in the area of oil investment. Indeed, the decision to hold this second workshop is a reflection of the success of that meeting. Today, we shall be talking about either digging deeper or digging in slightly different places to last year, as we set about our deliberations. At the same time, we will be able to benefit from fresh new insights provided by our speakers and participants.

The broad objective of this workshop remains similar to last year’s, namely to analyse the investment needs of the oil sector, particularly the challenges that will have to be overcome in order to obtain the necessary investment to fund sectoral expansion over the longer term.

These challenges cover many issues of both a short- and a long-term nature, in a world that is more complex and interdependent than ever before. We all face these challenges, regardless of whether we are producers or consumers, OPEC or non-OPEC. Moreover, we need to handle these challenges — or, at least, most of them — in a manner that stretches across all participating groups.

We have been greatly helped in this process by the closer working relationship that has been established between OPEC and the IEA in recent years. Here, I refer not only to the success of last year’s joint workshop. Nine months before that, in September 2002, there was the first-ever joint press conference between our two organisations at the 17th World Petroleum Congress in Rio de Janeiro. There have also been many fruitful areas of informal contact, to exchange ideas and information, and we have all benefited from them. It is no secret that such exchanges prior to the war in Iraq last year made a significant contribution towards stabilising the oil market at a time when it was subjected to enormous pressure.

We welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the IEA’s major reference publication, “World Energy Investment Outlook — 2003 Insights”. We congratulate the agency on producing such a comprehensive and valuable study on investment. This work demonstrates the clear need to continue to focus our attention upon these important topics. As the IEA study clearly shows, the subject of investment embraces a multitude of dimensions, covering the whole chain of activities in the oil sector, as well as other primary energy sources and applications.

The study confirms the OPEC view that the resource base is sufficiently abundant to satisfy expected demand growth over the coming decades and that large levels of investment will be required. I am sure that this meeting today will spend time looking at the expected scale of these investment needs, and how this relates to past experience within the industry. But we need to be fully aware of the large uncertainties that we will have to deal with, and, indeed, this will be a major focus of attention in this afternoon’s session.

Such common ground provides us with much to build on, since there are still some understandable areas of difference between OPEC and the IEA, as one might expect in the light of their respective agendas. But such areas, I am glad to say, have been reduced with the passing of the years, as it has become clearer that, while we have the same broad objectives with regard to achieving a secure, stable market, we are looking at the situation from a different angle. This has been helped by a steadily growing sense of collective responsibility for the state of the market within the international petroleum community, which is very welcome. The benefits of this can be felt throughout the industry, not only upstream, but also downstream, including transportation and distribution. Indeed, it has become widely acknowledged that the downstream industry should feature prominently in our assessments both now and in the future, so as to avoid it becoming a source of price volatility.

The proven value of cooperation between consumers and producers is reflected in the evolution of the International Energy Forum (IEF), and the establishment of its permanent Secretariat in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The 9th IEF will be held in Amsterdam in less than a month’s time and its theme will be closely related to that of today’s workshop. Both our organisations will be well-represented there. So today’s workshop will have the added benefit of helping all of us to prepare for that important event.

Also, the fact that senior officials and experts from OPEC and the IEA are meeting under one roof this week means that we are having the opportunity to discuss other important issues, including an exchange of views on the current difficult market conditions. I am confident that such exchanges, as in the past, will improve understanding of each other’s positions on these matters. Even if the scope for actual agreement remains limited, this is nevertheless bound to send a positive signal to the market. To this end, a high-level team from OPEC’s Petroleum Market Analysis Department will be paying a working visit to their counterparts in the IEA tomorrow.

Let me conclude by re-emphasising that OPEC remains committed to its fundamental objectives of seeking order and stability in the international oil market, with secure supply, reasonable prices and fair returns for investors. As has been made clear at this workshop, however, OPEC’s perspective is not just the immediate time-horizon; it also extends well into the future. This is why we attach so much importance to such workshops as the one we are holding today.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/354-28-april-2004.html"
"2003-12-15","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by reading the following passage of text to you.

“For a long time, Venezuela’s economy will continue to be tied to the country’s great mineral wealth, fundamentally made up of its enormous oil resources. Among the mono-producing countries dependent on foreign trade, the case of Venezuela is typical of how dangerous this situation is for the normal life of a nation, a position that lacks the possibility of control of the events that can greatly affect its whole economy.

“In addition to other unfavourable circumstances that mono-production implies, the fact that the predominant product, petroleum, is depletable is a serious aggravating factor. It is a very precious and important resource whose value and importance are derived in part precisely because it cannot be renewed or produced at will.”

These words came from the pen of one of the founding fathers of OPEC: Dr Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonzo.

Although the specific reference in this extract is Venezuela, these words, in fact, could apply to any of OPEC’s 11 Member Countries.

They were written nearly 40 years ago, when OPEC was still in its infancy and its Member Countries’ petroleum sectors were dominated by the large multinational oil companies, known as “The Seven Sisters”.

Much progress has been made since then in improving the situation, as a direct consequence of the existence of OPEC, particularly in such areas as asserting sovereign rights and achieving market stability, but it is a never-ending process in a global economy that is still dominated by the large industrial powers.

It is because of Dr Pérez Alfonzo that we are meeting here today, just after the centenary of his birth in Caracas on 13 December 1903. We have used the occasion to launch an English version of an important book he wrote on the subject of the Venezuelan petroleum industry. The book was originally published in Spanish in 1967, with the title of El Pentágono Petrolero. Its English title is The Petroleum Pentagon. The extract I read to you comes from this new translation.

Dr Pérez Alfonzo, who died, aged 75, on 3 September 1979, was one of Venezuela’s greatest political thinkers of the 20th century. He was an eminent lawyer and professor of civil law at the Central University of Venezuela. His thoughts, captured in his various books, articles, parliamentary speeches, lectures, administrative programmes and strategies, provided the foundation for many government decisions and policies on hydrocarbons.

Indeed, the impact of the product of Dr Pérez Alfonzo’s exceptionally fertile intellect went beyond his native country of Venezuela. He was one of the earliest political thinkers to espouse and vigorously canvass unity among oil-producing countries as a strategy for optimising the benefit of their God-endowed natural resources for the benefit of their own people.

He maintained that oil-producing countries should coordinate their oil policies, taking into consideration the special circumstances of each country. Through benefiting from each other’s experiences and knowledge, these nations could mitigate their disadvantages, correct their past mistakes and avoid making new ones.

Dr Pérez Alfonzo first made an impression in 1945–48, when, as Minister of Development, he introduced legislation which ensured that Venezuela would receive 50 per cent of the profits from the petroleum activities undertaken in the country, as well as having greater control over the industry.

There then followed a decade of military dictatorship. As a result of his firm democratic beliefs, Dr Pérez Alfonzo spent the first part of that period in prison and then in exile. But he used the time well, devoting himself to an intensive study of the oil industry.

He thus emerged from this troubled period well prepared to take up public office again in 1958, as Venezuela’s Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons. Just two years later, in September 1960, OPEC was created. Dr Pérez Alfonzo retired from public life in 1964, but, as a highly respected elder statesman, he was still widely consulted in governing circles and his views were sought on many economic and political issues.

The renowned author, Daniel Yergin, wrote the following about Dr Pérez Alfonzo in his standard work on the oil industry, The Prize:

“He … brought to his new office a sophisticated understanding of the structure of the oil industry, as well as his own clearly defined objectives.

“He wanted not only to increase the government’s share of the rents, but also to effect a transfer to the government, and away from the oil companies, of power and authority over production and marketing.

“To sell oil too cheaply, he argued, was bad for consumers, as the result would be the premature exhaustion of a non-renewable resource and the discouragement of new development.

“For the producing countries, oil was a national heritage, the benefits of which belonged to future generations, as well as to the present. Neither the resource, nor the wealth that flows from it, should be wasted. Instead the earnings should be used to develop the country more widely.

“Sovereign governments, rather than foreign corporations, should make the basic decisions about the production and the disposition of their petroleum. Human nature should not be allowed to squander the potential of this precious resource.”

These sentiments remain with us today and have been central to the philosophy of our Organization since its establishment in Baghdad in September 1960.

However, their modern relevance should not detract from the fact that they were considered revolutionary in the 1950s and that our Member Countries, with their activities coordinated through OPEC, fought hard and long to assert their sovereign rights to control the destiny of their indigenous natural resources in the period up to the mid-1970s. Since that time, we have also had to ensure that there is no erosion of the valuable gains we made.

Dr Pérez Alfonzo made a significant contribution towards conceptualising and creating OPEC, together with his counterparts from the four other Founder Members — Fuad Rouhani from Iran, Dr Tala’at Al-Shaibani from Iraq, Ahmed Sayed Omar from Kuwait and Abdullah Tariki from Saudi Arabia.

I was privileged to start my career in the oil industry close to Dr Pérez Alfonzo’s team.

He was already a well-known national figure at the time, but, in his presence, you never noticed this, because, by nature, he was a modest man, a pensive man, a man utterly committed to pursuing causes which had a human face to them, even if this meant making personal sacrifices. He was a politician in the classic Greek mould.

He was both a visionary and an achiever — a rare combination. The best proof of this can be found here and now, in the shape of OPEC! OPEC was his vision. But he played a big part in bringing this vision to reality.

He had a wealth of ideas and his interests extended well beyond the petroleum industry. He loved nature and the simple life, and was a committed environmentalist, decades before this became fashionable. He was especially concerned about population growth trends and the need for these to be in harmony with a country’s development aspirations.

Working close to him gave me a fresh new perspective of the petroleum sector, that it was not there for the benefit of individuals, but instead was more like a national treasure, which should be exploited with care and in a responsible manner, so that the whole country could benefit from it.

The OPEC Secretariat is publishing this English version of Dr Pérez Alfonzo’s book, The Petroleum Pentagon, as a tribute to him and to make it available to a much wider international readership, including our Member Countries, to help them better appreciate the circumstances of the birth of our Organization.

This brief but intellectually very rich book puts forward an action plan for Venezuela, the implementation of which would lead to effective control over its natural hydrocarbon resources, through an adequate level of exploitation that would avoid economic and physical waste.

This strategy foresaw an Organization like OPEC as being one of its main pillars. Without OPEC’s presence, an oil strategy for a country in similar circumstances was seen as fragile and dangerously exposed to risky unilateral or weak bilateral actions, the kind of risk that OPEC, with its fundamental objective of policy coordination and cooperation on oil matters, tries to avoid.

The strategy is anchored on five pillars, from which the title of the book, The Petroleum Pentagon, is drawn.

The first pillar is reasonable economic participation for the nation, as the owner of the natural resource. The second pillar is the creation of a government body to control the conservation of, and trade in, hydrocarbons. The third pillar is the creation of a state-owned company to handle oil activity directly, both upstream and downstream, as well as internally and externally, and which could simultaneously deal with existing private companies. The fourth pillar is a “moratorium on new concessions” to individuals and a complete review of the prevailing concessionary system which did not favour the host country. And the final pillar is OPEC, the Organization that establishes international cooperation as being indispensable for the effective implementation of the strategy.

I believe that, in order to gain a fuller understanding of anything, it is important to return to the grass roots every so often. The petroleum industry is no exception. I would, therefore, recommend that those of you who wish to enhance your understanding of this remarkable Organization of ours, set aside some time to read this interesting and valuable book by one of our founding fathers.

Finally, I should like to thank all those people who were involved in the preparation of this book in the English language, at short notice. The translation was carried out by Karen Sturges-Vera, the editing by Douglas Linton, and the cover design and production by Alaa Al-Saigh and Diana Lavnick. Their efforts are much appreciated.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/315-15-december-2003.html"
"2003-11-20","Ladies and gentlemen,

Energy security is so central to OPEC’s way of thinking that we welcome any chance we get to explain our position on this important topic. Thank you, therefore, for giving me such an opportunity today.

OPEC and its 11 Member Countries understand the very real concern many consumers have about energy security. Advanced forms of commercial energy services are essential for life as we know it today in fast-moving, hi-tech consumer societies. These societies would, without any doubt, suffer severe difficulties, if they were deprived of the required large levels of energy. Therefore, it is a matter of utmost importance for these countries to ensure that, at all times, they have access to sufficient quantities of energy, at affordable prices, and, better still, if this energy has sound environmental credentials.

OPEC’s commitment to security of supply in the international oil market can be clearly seen in its Statute, in its decisions, in its actions and in its relations with other parties.

The OPEC Statute, which was drafted shortly after our foundation in September 1960, declares: “The Organization shall devise ways and means of ensuring the stabilisation of prices in international markets, with a view to eliminating harmful and unnecessary fluctuations.

“Due regard shall be given at all times to the interests of the producing nations and to the necessity of securing: a steady income to the producing countries; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry.”

These are not empty words. They have acted as the guiding principle behind our decisions and actions throughout our history. Even in the 1970s, contrary to popular belief, the sudden shortages in crude supply that occurred during that decade were the result of external political developments and not OPEC policy.

The most recent visible example of OPEC’s commitment to security of supply occurred earlier this year, with the hostilities in Iraq. Many people had predicted that this would lead to a sudden steep rise in oil prices and a period of protracted volatility. But this did not occur. OPEC ensured that the market was kept well-supplied with oil at all times, together with reasonable, stable prices, in accordance with the terms of our Statute. Indeed, at around the same time, there were serious unexpected cutbacks in output from two other leading oil producers, and the impact of these on world oil prices was again successfully handled by our Organization, with welcome support from some leading non-OPEC producers.

OPEC’s market-stabilisation measures revolve around keeping OPEC output at levels that will help maintain a price range of US $22–28 a barrel for our Reference Basket of seven crudes. Our “price band”, as we call it, is flexible enough to absorb reasonable short-term price fluctuations, as well as defining a price range which balances the interests of producers and consumers. If prices begin to settle outside the limits of the band, OPEC adjusts its production level accordingly, to correct the situation.

The principle of the price band has been well-received by the industry since its introduction three years ago, due to its realistic, practical and transparent nature, although — as one would expect — not everyone agrees with its upper and lower limits.

OPEC was able to introduce such an effective tool because it felt confident about what the market wanted, needed and could live with. While this confidence was partly due to the extensive experience OPEC has of oil market matters, it was reinforced by the rise in dialogue within the industry in recent years, dialogue which has been very much encouraged by OPEC. After all, an important pre-condition for any form of security is to actually talk to each other! This can then lead on to consensus and cooperation on important issues — as, indeed, has been the case.

For those of you who still remain unconvinced about OPEC’s good faith, let me put it another way. A commitment to security of supply is sheer common sense for oil-producing developing countries. The development of our domestic economies is heavily dependant upon the revenue we receive from petroleum sales on world markets. I am not just talking about volumes here. I am also referring to the need for a flow of revenue that is steady and predictable, since this is essential for planning and investment purposes. When looked at in this way, it is clear that oil-producing developing countries value security of supply as much as consuming countries, perhaps even more. We know that, if we rock the boat, then we are likely to be among the first ones to fall overboard.

This brings me onto the important reciprocal concept — security of demand. To obtain steady and predictable revenue, producers need steady and predictable demand. How can they make any plans for domestic development or for investment in future production capacity if their revenue flows are erratic and unpredictable?

It is all very well consumers expressing the wish to diversify sources of supply at their own discretion, to enact legislation to this effect or to radically revise fiscal regimes. But these actions may, in their own right, be detrimental to security of supply, particularly in the longer term, by creating serious doubts about future levels of demand. In the petroleum industry, investment involves long lead times and the life-cycle of some projects can stretch over decades, particularly with regard to gas supply infrastructure. Who in their right mind is going to commit billions to a long-term petroleum project unless they are absolutely certain that there will be a satisfactory return on their investment at the end of the day?

Gas producers with long-term supply agreements with some European countries, for example, have been deeply dismayed by the way the European Union introduces new legislation which affects these producers directly, without involving them in the discussion process and seeking to address their legitimate concerns. How can these producers assess future investment needs when they have to live with such a past experience, which may prove to be very costly for them?

The need for security of demand should by recognised by consumers as much as the need for security of supply. They are different sides of the same coin and therefore should be handled in a balanced manner, as the industry seeks to meet the world energy requirement in an efficient, effective and equitable manner. This energy requirement is substantial and is forecast to continue growing by an annual average of around two per cent up to 2020.

In the case of the petroleum industry, OPEC’s World Energy Model forecasts a 41 per cent rise in world oil demand, from 76 million barrels a day in 2000 to 107 mb/d in 2020. It projects even faster growth for the other major hydrocarbon, gas — 78 per cent — from 42 to 75 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the same 20-year period. All in all, about two-thirds of the world’s commercial energy is expected to come from petroleum — oil and gas — in 2020.

OPEC’s Member Countries possess about 80 per cent of the world’s proven crude oil reserves and nearly 50 per cent of its natural gas and thus have the reserve strength to cope with the forecast rises in demand in the coming decades. Non-OPEC oil supplies are expected to reach a plateau in the meantime.

However, huge investment is required for this. For OPEC oil alone, the investment is estimated at nearly $100 billion by 2010 and nearly $200 bn by 2020. For the more costly non-OPEC oil, the figures are much higher. How can the industry — especially in developing countries — be expected to make such a massive financial commitment without reasonable guarantees that there will be enough customers to buy the petroleum throughout the projected life-time of the new facilities?

Ladies and gentlemen,

Energy security is a very big subject and I have only touched upon the issues that are of most concern to OPEC. These can be condensed into the assertion that energy security is a two-way process — for the petroleum industry, at least — and that it should recognise that security of supply and security of demand are complementary issues that merit similar fair and balanced treatment.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/316-20-november-2003.html"
"2003-11-17","Ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for inviting me to this beautiful part of Austria to deliver this keynote address. The organisers have done an excellent job in arranging this workshop, but I am sure the keen sportsmen among you will wish that it had been arranged a month or two later, because the Semmering area is famous for its ski resorts and the new season has not begun yet! It is also a wonderful area for walking at other times of the year.

The subject of this workshop is a very important one, and one that has risen to prominence in the petroleum industry’s agenda over the past couple of decades, as people realise that the true cost of any project can be far greater than might appear on a company’s balance sheet — and very often is.

It is particularly meritorious that a workshop is being held with the specific purpose of improving the way the industry handles issues of environmental and social impacts, by developing guidelines that are applicable to development projects in any geographical area. I understand that you have already received some revealing insights into this matter, with the case studies that were presented to you in today’s two sessions.

I was particularly impressed by the following sentence, which I have found in the workshop’s background pack, because I believe it sums up the situation facing the industry rather well:

“As responsible exploiters of hydrocarbon reserves, the exploration and production industry must meet the challenges of satisfying an increasing world demand for clean and cheap energy, whilst complying with international (and) national environmental regulatory requirements and satisfying the increasingly demanding environmental and social expectations of international and local communities.”

Our Staff at the OPEC Secretariat — just an hour’s drive from here, in the middle of Vienna — will continue to monitor the progress of your Taskforce as it develops its work, and will keep our 11 Members informed of your activities, since they are of much relevance to the oil and gas projects that take place in their countries.

We are all working in partnership with each other when it comes to exploiting the world’s finite petroleum resources, and so it is necessary to ensure that every effort is made to facilitate this process, including the handling of issues of environmental and social concern.

OPEC has almost 850 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves, which is nearly 80 per cent of the global figure; but its actual share of world production at the present time is less than half of this, in terms of percentage points, at around 37 per cent. There is an even bigger discrepancy for natural gas, with world proven reserves of almost 50 per cent set against current marketed production of just 16 per cent. OPEC’s proven natural gas reserves total almost 87 trillion standard cubic metres, or, to equate them with crude oil, nearly 550 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

In other words, OPEC’s share of world production is well below its reserve strength for both hydrocarbons, and this has been the case for decades. The simple laws of arithmetic tell us that, all other things being equal, this imbalance will be corrected in the future and there will be a growing reliance on petroleum from our Member Countries. This will be particularly the case for crude oil, since, not only does OPEC have such a high proportion of the world’s reserves, but these reserves are much more accessible than those in other, high-cost regions of the world. OPEC clearly has the reserve strength to cope with the rising levels of demand for both oil and gas that are expected in the early 21st century.

OPEC’s World Energy Model forecasts a 41 per cent rise in world oil demand, from 76 million barrels a day in 2000 to 107 mb/d in 2020. It projects even faster growth for gas — 78 per cent — from 42 to 75 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the same 20-year period. Oil’s share of the world energy mix is expected to dip slightly to 38 per cent by 2020, while that of gas will rise from 23 to 28 per cent, overtaking solids, which will fall to 25 per cent.

With non-OPEC oil production likely to reach a plateau, OPEC’s Member Countries will be expected to satisfy most of the projected new demand. Our projections see OPEC producing 36 mb/d of crude in 2010, which constitutes 40 per cent of global supply, rising to 52 mb/d in 2020, a share of almost 49 per cent. Thus OPEC is expected to become an even bigger player in a petroleum industry that is itself expanding.

In investment terms, we are looking at very large sums of money. For OPEC oil alone, the investment is estimated at nearly $100 billion by 2010 and as much as $200 bn by 2020. For the more costly non-OPEC oil, the figures are much higher. And then there is gas, with the enormous costs involved in developing its infrastructure, particularly for transporting it vast distances to consumer markets.

To ensure orderly growth of the petroleum industry, it is essential that there is a stable base. OPEC seeks to provide this for oil through its pricing and production agreements. Our objectives are to ensure that the international oil market is kept well-supplied with crude oil at all times, with reasonable prices and fair returns to investors. But this must be supported in turn by assurances of steady, predictable demand from consumers.

In many consumer markets, gas prices are tied to oil prices. Therefore, a sound pricing policy for oil is also beneficial to gas. This provides an added incentive to oil producers with a big involvement in the gas sector to support our market-stabilisation measures.

OPEC’s production agreements are aimed at keeping prices within a band of US $22–28 a barrel for our Reference Basket of seven crudes. We have identified this range as balancing the interests of producers and consumers; the flexibility of the system allows for the market’s regular fluctuations to be absorbed in an orderly manner. If prices begin to settle outside the limits of the band, OPEC adjusts its production level accordingly, to correct the situation.

OPEC’s price band policy has won widespread acceptance in the market since its introduction three years ago and has helped bring about stability and reasonable prices. To be truly effective, of course, our market-stabilisation measures require the support of non-OPEC producers, and we welcome very much the advances that have been made in this regard in recent years.

There is now a far greater willingness for dialogue and cooperation, and this spreads right across the industry, embracing producers and consumers and the multitude of companies, large and small, that bind them together.

Many such companies are represented at this workshop. You are all involved, in some way or another, in finding the most efficient, effective and economic means of exploiting the world’s petroleum resources and in doing this in a way that blends in well with existing environmental and social systems, together with making reasonable returns.

I should like to provide you with some observations in this important area that I have gained from my years of experience in the petroleum industry of an oil-producing developing country, Venezuela. I hope you will find these useful.

The first point I wish to make concerns the importance of information. This is a two-way process. Before setting-up operations, the guest company and the host country should ensure that there is a full exchange of information about every relevant aspect of the project, with established channels of communication, so as to ensure that the venture proceeds smoothly and harmoniously, from beginning to end.

Of course, there is no general rule here and every project must be treated on its merits. It must also be understood from the word “go” that the situation can be a very fluid one with many uncertainties, and that some of the original assumptions and conditions may require revision with the passage of time.

The type of information in which a host country is likely to be interested includes the following: a verifiable case history of the guest company; full assurances about its financial and commercial viability; the reasons for its interest in the project, including its perceptions of the likely reward; indications about its compatibility with life in the local community; a demonstration of its attitude towards environmental issues; and advice about its ambitions, with regard to, for example, possible future involvement with the host country in some other, related area.

A guest company is likely to want to find out as much as it can about the living and working conditions in the host country. This includes: the supporting infrastructure for industry, trade and commerce and its international connections; the economic, social, political and legal systems; the labour market; the housing sector; the historical background, culture and traditions; social and political issues of current concern; the environmental landscape; and the facilities available to the company, as a corporate entity, and its employees, individually, to maintain effective communications with their home countries, in the broadest sense of the term.

Both sides should consider the enterprise as being a professional partnership, with a fair, balanced and transparent division of the returns, which has been agreed on, in advance, through negotiations. Issues relating directly to the host country’s permanent sovereignty over its natural resources should be settled at the beginning, too. These include the degree to which the guest company integrates itself into the entire matrix of the host country’s petroleum industry and its rights of ownership to any plant or equipment that may be installed as part of the project.

Every company and its employees must abide by the law — that goes without saying. But legal systems and legislation can vary enormously from one country to the next, and there may be some situations where the necessary specialist legislation for a petroleum project quite simply does not exist. Perhaps the country in question is just starting-up operations in the industry. It is then the responsibility of the guest company to act in an honourable manner and to observe the spirit of the law, in the sense of applying a reasonable interpretation of what could be described as the closest similar law, even if this law’s precise application was in some other field.

Alternatively, there may be situations where legislation cannot keep up with the pace of technology, or where one domestic law contradicts another. Here again, good faith is required from the company in its interpretation of the law, and, where possible, this should be done in full consultation with the country’s legal authorities, with the emphasis being put on encouraging the fullest possible use of the most advanced technology in undertaking a project.

In Venezuela, we have sought to clarify this situation, by introducing a clause in our new hydrocarbons law which states that all petroleum operations must be carried out in accordance with our general laws on the preservation of the environment, even if there has been no specific application of such a law to the petroleum sector. We are very strict about this, because of our country’s deep concern about the state of the environment.

The situation has changed from the past in two distinct ways.

First, there is now a greater awareness of environmental issues in the minds of the public at large, allied to expectations that every effort is made to keep industry, trade and commerce as clean and as safe as possible, from the beginning of a project to its conclusion — so that all adverse environmental impacts have been removed once a company has wound up its activities and left the area.

And secondly, continued advances in technology have enabled us to minimise impacts on the environment throughout a project’s life. Technology now provides us with the capability to access data about a potential development site with remarkable levels of detail in even the most remote locations — using satellite images at one extreme and virtual reality displays of sea-bed terrains at the other, in the case of the petroleum industry. Technology enables us to install state-of-the-art plant and equipment which can satisfy even the toughest environmental laws and regulations. And technology allows us to tightly control every stage of the production process, from needle-sharp monitoring of day-to-day operations to the facility to quickly and effectively adjust to changing conditions as and when the need arises.

Let me refer again to my home country, Venezuela, to illustrate the difference between the past and the present. Intensive exploitation of the hydrocarbon resources in the Lake Maracaibo area began in the early 20th century at a time when the state of technology was primitive compared with today. We now sadly have a situation where repeated subsidence over the years means that the lake now stands about ten metres above the surrounding countryside and that an elaborate system of walled defences are in place to prevent flooding on a massive scale. Moreover, once it was a valuable fresh-water reservoir, but now it is salinated. This compares with the new hydrocarbon development in the Orinoco delta, where every effort is being made to extract natural gas in a manner that is in harmony with the needs of the surrounding environment, including the nearby location of a national park. It has already been decided that deposits from the venture are not just left in the water, but instead are collected and carefully disposed of in specially prepared sites on land. Companies bidding for concessions are required to cater for the environmental impacts in their proposals.

The exploitation of the world’s finite oil and gas resources is a hazardous and risky business at every level — the economic, the political, the legal, the social and the environmental. As oil and gas producers, we have the responsibility to ensure that this task proceeds in a manner that is conducive to the well-being of mankind.

As we saw at the World Summit in Johannesburg last year, the provision of energy services is an essential input to the process of sustainable development and the eradication of the drastic poverty that affects much of the world today. At the other extreme, modern consumer societies could not exist in their present form without continued access to advanced forms of energy that have supported their growth and development over the past 200 years.

As I have outlined in this address, OPEC and its 11 Member Countries are committed to creating a petroleum sector that can fully meet the world’s growing energy needs in the years and decades to come. Due to our strong hydrocarbon resource base, we are in a position of much influence. But the full involvement of the oil and gas industry at large is required if we are to be truly effective in achieving these universal goals.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/317-17-november-2003.html"
"2003-11-05","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to comment on a topic that is very close to our hearts in OPEC — cooperation.

It is interesting to see that the organisers have linked cooperation with the development of energy diplomacy, because, in OPEC, we cannot imagine any kind of effective diplomacy without cooperation!

OPEC itself was founded on the premise of cooperation in September 1960. Let us look at the OPEC Statute, which was drafted shortly after our foundation. This begins: “The principal aim of the Organization shall be the coordination and unification of the petroleum policies of Member Countries and the determination of the best means for safeguarding their interests, individually and collectively.”

It continues: “The Organization shall devise ways and means of ensuring the stabilisation of prices in international markets, with a view to eliminating harmful and unnecessary fluctuations.

“Due regard shall be given at all times to the interests of the producing nations and to the necessity of securing: a steady income to the producing countries; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming nations; and a fair return on their capital to those investing in the petroleum industry.”

To understand the full significance of this declaration, you must appreciate the historical context.

Here were five oil-producing, developing countries — four from the Middle East and the fifth, Venezuela, from half-way across the world — joining forces to safeguard their legitimate national interests at a time when the international petroleum industry, outside the former Soviet Union, was under the iron grip of the established industrial powers. Much of the developing world was still dominated by powerful colonial interests, even though this centuries-old enforced institution was gradually being dismantled. Indeed, some countries had already gained independence by 1960 and others would soon follow.

In such a climate, the formation of OPEC was a brave act, a pioneering act, an act that demonstrated that even developing countries had rights, that their indigenous natural resources were more than just a convenience for the rich consumer nations, to be pumped out of the ground as and when these foreign powers deemed fit.

Looked at in this way, cooperation within OPEC had a backbone of steel. And this backbone has remained as OPEC has grown over the years, becoming an established, respected member of the global energy community.

Other oil-producing developing countries joined OPEC in the next decade and a half, extending the Organization’s reach to North Africa, West Africa and South-East Asia and reinforcing its central core of cooperation. They were all committed to OPEC’s longstanding objectives of ensuring order and stability in the international oil market, with secure supply, steady demand, reasonable prices and fair returns to investors.

The next major advance occurred in the late-1980s. This was a consequence of three linked developments. First, there was the gradual erosion of the oil price structure in the early 1980s and its eventual collapse in 1986, which caused severe domestic upheavals and huge revenue losses for oil producers. Secondly, there was a significant reduction in OPEC’s market influence, due to its sizeable loss of market share since the late 1970s. And thirdly, there was the realisation by non-OPEC producers after 1986 that market-stabilisation measures were urgently needed and that OPEC required support in providing these.

In other words, non-OPEC producers — from both the developing and developed worlds — had finally acknowledged what OPEC had been saying for years, that cooperation is vital for the ongoing welfare of the international oil market.

It was only a matter of time before this process broadened out further, and this occurred with major advances in producer-consumer dialogue in the 1990s, in tandem with the rising profile of the International Energy Forum, whose specific purpose was to provide the setting for such dialogue. This process received its formal seal of approval with the recent decision to establish a permanent Secretariat for this forum in an OPEC Member Country, Saudi Arabia.

When presented in this manner, there seems little doubt that the concept of cooperation within the world oil industry is now well-established — although, of course, such is the complexity of this industry and the underlying forces and pressures that propel it, that there is still plenty of scope for improvement. But, since the end of the 1980s, there has come the clear realisation that the industry is better-off if there is an underlying consensus on, at least, the major issues that concern all parties — such as pricing, stability, security of demand and supply, investment, environmental issues and sustainable development. A lot of progress has been made in this regard, thankfully. But this is not enough.

The situation is somewhat different for the gas sector, where, at a global level, the concept of cooperation is less well-established. This is partly because of the regional nature of the gas industry, although this may be changing now, in the light of current developments with liquefied natural gas, which is introducing a global dimension to gas supply. Also, right now, gas is not as critical to the overall welfare of the modern consumer society as oil; however — again — this may change with time, due, in particular, to gas being the fuel of choice for environmentalists. Furthermore, the international gas sector, which can still be described as relatively young, has been in the advantageous position of benefiting from the lessons of history and avoiding some of the mistakes made by the oil sector over the past century and a half. And finally, a higher proportion of gas reserves can be found close to consumer markets and this eases the flow of gas from its source to its final destination.

However, this is only a matter of degree, compared with the oil sector, and the need for cooperation in the gas sector is every bit as real as it is for oil. This is even more the case, when you consider the bright market prospects for gas, the fact that demand for gas is forecast to grow strongly in the coming decades and that it will increase its share of the global energy mix. OPEC’s projections show this share rising from 23 per cent in 2000 to 28 per cent in 2020, although this latter figure will still be ten percentage points below that of oil, whose market share will decline slightly to 38 per cent in that period.

The recent formation of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum recognises the need for discussion of issues of mutual concern to gas producers and its role is likely to grow in the future. Its membership includes seven OPEC Member Countries and Russia. The fact that these eight countries are also leading oil producers brings with it further important benefits, in terms of cooperation across the two closely related petroleum sectors.

The message from all of this is that the petroleum industry — both oil and gas — is well-disposed towards dialogue, as it seeks to handle present and future challenges. This is a welcome development, because the challenges are formidable, numerous and diverse in nature — especially since they cover two hydrocarbon sectors and, moreover, interact with each other!

OPEC’s present policy is to ensure that the international oil market is well-supplied with crude, with reasonable, stable prices. Our production agreements are aimed at keeping prices within a band of US $22–28 a barrel for OPEC’s Reference Basket of seven crudes, which is the range we have identified as balancing the interests of producers and consumers; the flexibility of this system allows for the market’s regular fluctuations to be absorbed in an orderly manner. If prices begin to settle outside the limits of the band, OPEC adjusts its production agreement accordingly, to correct the situation. However, to be truly effective, our market-stabilisation measures require the support of non-OPEC producers, and much progress has been made in this regard in recent years.

In many consumer markets, gas prices are tied to oil prices. Therefore, a sound pricing policy for oil is also beneficial to gas. This provides an added incentive to oil producers with a big involvement in the gas sector to support our market-stabilisation measures.

Looking at the longer term, demand is expected to continue growing steadily in the early decades of this century. OPEC’s World Energy Model forecasts a 41 per cent rise in world oil demand, from 76 million barrels a day in 2000 to 107 mb/d in 2020. It projects even faster growth for gas — 78 per cent — from 42 to 75 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the same 20-year period.

Requirements for petroleum to meet increasingly stringent regulations, particularly for environmental reasons, make this more than an issue of mere volumes. And the situation becomes even more complex in the light of the challenges presented by other aspects of 21st century energy dynamics — these include globalisation, the information revolution, rapid technological change, regionalism and sustainable development. There is a wide range of choices, therefore, about the world’s energy options on every time-horizon.

The decision-making process itself has a diverse set of possibilities, from simple day-to-day transactions to international diplomacy involving governments, major companies or a mixture of both. Fresh impetus has been given to energy diplomacy over the past decade, following, in particular, the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and this has contributed towards a significant shift in the world energy order.

The part OPEC has played in this process has covered an array of issues related to the present and future welfare of the international oil market. We have been actively seeking to the preserve the integrity of crude oil as the world’s leading energy source and to assure consumers of OPEC’s firm commitment to secure, stable oil supply. This rides hand-in-hand with the fact that our 11 Member Countries possess around four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves.

OPEC’s substantial presence in the gas sector — where our Member Countries hold around half the world’s proven natural gas reserves — adds further resonance to OPEC’s central role in future energy supply.

Ladies and gentlemen,

We have moved forward a long way since September 1960, when a group of five oil-producing developing countries took a decision to cooperate with each other and form OPEC. The world of petroleum is a very different place now. But the basics remains the same: stability, security, sufficiency, equity. And binding all these elements together is cooperation.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/318-5th-november-2003.html"
"2003-11-04","I should like to begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to deliver this address on the subject of cooperation and the link between oil and gas.

The energy world has moved forward a long way over the past decade and a half, from the time it was divided along broad ideological grounds into the centrally planned economies and the market economies, with limited amount of contact between them. Now, energy issues are viewed from a global perspective in a world of constantly evolving economic, social and political norms.

Russia has remained a major player in the petroleum industry throughout. It is now the world’s second-largest oil-exporter and has the world’s eighth-largest oil reserves. It is also the world’s largest gas-exporter and has the world’s largest gas reserves. And, as if this were not enough, it has the world’s second-largest coal reserves.

Russia has the formidable task of realising the full potential of its massive energy resource base. This long drawn-out process has included the replacement of old, inefficient infrastructure, plant and equipment, and the integration of a new competitive work ethic. There are also issues that relate to the size and nature of domestic energy demand in Russia, since these directly affect the petroleum resources which are available for export.

Many uncertainties exist about the pace and the extent of this renaissance of the country’s petroleum industry, and, due to its sheer scale, this has a direct bearing on the energy world as a whole. The process is still in a transitional phase, although a clearer picture is steadily emerging, as this vast country adjusts to the realities of playing a major role on the world energy stage.

OPEC’s principal concern revolves around the effects of all this on the international oil market. We have welcomed the support that Russia has given to our market-stabilisation measures since the early 1990s, and we believe that Russia, in turn, has benefited from the high level of success of these measures.

But some serious issues need to be resolved by all the leading parties in the oil market, if order and stability are to be maintained, with secure supply, steady demand, reasonable prices and fair returns to investors.

The first of these concerns the expectation that the growth in world oil supply will outstrip the growth in oil demand in the coming year.

The second relates to the longstanding trend for non-OPEC producers to gain market share at OPEC’s expense, by accounting for most of the incremental rise in oil demand. This is in spite of the fact that OPEC possesses four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves and that these are easier and cheaper to exploit than those elsewhere. It also overlooks the fact that OPEC has repeatedly reduced its output to support the price structure, so that the industry as a whole benefits.

And thirdly, there is the need to accommodate the return of Iraqi oil to the international market, even though we do not yet know the rate and extent of this.

On top of these are the usual day-to-day factors affecting the ongoing stability and performance of the international oil market, such as inventory movements, weather patterns, accidents, downstream developments, speculation and so on.

Therefore, it is incumbent upon all of us in the oil sector to ensure that we can accommodate these factors in a manner which is fair and reasonable to all the parties involved, as well as meeting the needs of the larger international community. This is not easy and involves a readiness for dialogue, cooperation and compromise at almost unprecedented levels.

Such a process should begin by ensuring that market fundamentals are observed, particularly with regard to reserve strength and the long-term sustainability of current output levels.

It should also acknowledge the merits of some form of international oil pricing policy, such as OPEC’s price band mechanism, which aims to keep the price of our Reference Basket of seven crudes within a range of US $22–28 a barrel. This combines the need for a flexible policy, which can absorb reasonable day-to-day price fluctuations, with a policy that sets a price range which balances the needs of producers and consumers.

And this process should observe the role of oil in addressing issues of broader human concern, such as meeting the demands of sustainable development, which will see the industry produce cleaner, safer fuels to help preserve the environment and assist in the process of eradicating poverty.

The stakes are high, because, by all accounts, the thirst for oil will continue to grow for decades to come, and this demand must be met in a full and timely manner. OPEC’s research indicates that world oil demand will rise by 41 per cent to 107 million barrels a day in the period 2000–20, and that there will be growing reliance on OPEC oil, due to our large reserve base. Huge investment is required to bring this oil in processed form to the consumer. For OPEC oil alone, this is estimated at nearly $100 billion by 2010 and nearly $200 billion by 2020. For the more costly non-OPEC oil, the figures are much higher.

Russia clearly has an important part to play in all of this, as its oil sector continues its course of restructuring and expansion.

Order and stability in the oil sector are essential not just for this hydrocarbon, but also for gas. This is because of the linkage between oil and gas prices in major consumer markets, whereby, if prices fall in a volatile oil market, they are likely to bring gas prices down with them. Therefore, the case for ensuring that a sound international oil price structure is in place at all times finds further valuable support.

OPEC, like Russia, has a strong base in the gas industry, even though the focus of our Organization is on the oil market. Our Member Countries hold almost half the world’s proven natural gas reserves, with the Islamic Republic of Iran and Qatar being second and third, respectively, to Russia, in global rankings. Algeria and Indonesia also place a heavy emphasis on the gas sector, in their hydrocarbon activities.

Gas producers share many of the basic challenges of oil producers, in ensuring they can meet demand in a full and timely manner. Demand for gas is forecast to rise faster than that of oil, although from a lower base. It is the source of commercial energy that is most favoured by environmentalists, as well as being a reliable and highly efficient source of power generation. Production costs are coming down too.

But the transportation of gas remains expensive, in spite of the big advances that are being made with liquefied natural gas, which are expected to turn it from being a regional to a global fuel. Also, legislation to liberalise energy markets, particularly in the European Union, has been handled without due regard to longstanding agreements with gas suppliers.

These and other issues affecting the gas sector now can find expression in the recently formed Gas Exporting Countries Forum, which has provided a meeting-point for many of the world’s leading gas producers, including Russia and seven OPEC Members. The fact that the composition of this forum includes major producers from both the oil and the gas sectors will clearly encourage harmony within the petroleum industry, which will benefit all of us.

Ladies and gentlemen,

This speech has focused on Russia, the host nation, and OPEC, the Organization I represent, and the links between the oil and gas sectors, in which both sides are heavily involved. Some of these links have their own inherent dynamics, while others need constant nurturing, through cooperation. The important thing is that we must ensure throughout, by means of our actions, that the energy needs of the world community are met in a satisfactory manner, both now and in the future.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/319-4th-november-2003.html"
"2003-10-22","Ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to thank the Energy Institute for this kind invitation to be Guest of Honour and Speaker at their Autumn Lunch.

This comes at a time of major change, following the merger of the Institute of Petroleum with the Institute of Energy earlier this year, to form the Energy Institute. We in OPEC warmly welcome any actions that support the relentless pursuit of excellence within the industry, especially when these involve institutions whose fine records of achievement stretch back more than three-quarters of a century. We wish the new Energy Institute every success in the future.

I should like to talk today about OPEC’s role and how this equips us to meet the challenges we face in the petroleum industry in the early 21st century. As you may know, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, itself, has been around for a long time — since September 1960.

OPEC is an international organization with 11 oil-exporting, developing countries as its Members. These countries exercise permanent sovereignty over their finite natural resources, principally petroleum, as outlined in United Nations resolutions. They are committed to ensuring that these natural resources are exploited in a sensible and responsible manner.

The OPEC Statute, which was first adopted in 1965, defines our principal objectives. It begins with the coordination and unification of our Member Countries’ petroleum policies, the safeguarding of their interests and the securing of a steady income for them from petroleum sales. This is of central importance to us, because petroleum revenue plays a major part in our efforts to develop our economies in a viable and sustainable manner.

The Statute also contains objectives that can be described as outward-looking. It pledges OPEC to the achievement of: stable oil prices; an efficient, economic and regular supply of petroleum to consuming countries; and fair returns to investors. In other words, OPEC’s policy is to consider and accommodate the interests of other parties in the industry in its decisions and actions — non-OPEC producers, consumers and investors.

In practice, the oil market conditions we seek have three fundamental elements. The first is steady, predictable demand. The second is an absence of disturbances on the supply side, caused by interruptions, shortages and uncertainty. And the third is the maintenance of a fair and stable price range. All of this, however, is easier said than done!

In addition to these market-stabilisation activities, OPEC has committed itself wholeheartedly to other causes, for which an orderly flow of energy can make a significant difference to the well-being of mankind and the global economy — notably environmental harmony, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty.

The application of energy, in one form or another, is an essential dynamic ingredient of everyday economic activity. Accessing energy can be described as perhaps the most important issue facing mankind, with ramifications which can be economic, political, social, legal or strategic, and a reach which can be local, regional, national or international — or a combination of all of these.

Oil is the leading source of commercial energy in the modern world, accounting for around 40 per cent of today’s world energy mix. It is a unique commodity, with a combination of attributes which far exceeds that of any other energy source — sufficiency, accessibility, versatility, ease of transport and, in many areas, low costs. These have been complemented by a multitude of practical benefits that can be gained from decades of intensive exploitation and use in the industrial, commercial and domestic fields.

There is every indication that oil will maintain this leading role well into the 21st century. This is in spite of the fact that, over the past decade or so, oil has come under pressure on environmental grounds, particularly in the context of the UN-sponsored climate change negotiations. There have also been longer-standing efforts among some consuming nations to diversify energy sources away from oil, on so-called “strategic grounds”. However, projections from the reference case of OPEC’s World Energy Model, “OWEM”, suggest only a marginal dip to 38 per cent in oil’s market share in the period to 2020. In absolute terms, world oil demand is forecast to rise from 76 million barrels a day in 2000 to 107 mb/d in 2020 — that is, by around 41 per cent.

The chief beneficiary of all of this will be gas. Gas has a more favourable environmental profile among the fossil fuels, and is a reliable and highly efficient source of power generation. It is now relatively low in cost to produce, although still expensive to transport to consumers. Our reference case shows that the use of gas will almost double in the period 2000–20 and its share in the global energy mix will rise from 23 per cent to 28 per cent; however, this will still be ten percentage points below oil’s share. In absolute terms, world gas demand will rise from 42.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2000 to 75.0 mboe/d in 2020 — that is, by around 78 per cent.

All in all, about two-thirds of the world’s commercial energy is expected to come from petroleum — oil and gas — in 2020. OPEC is well endowed with both hydrocarbons, having almost 80 per cent of the world’s proven oil reserves and nearly 50 per cent of its natural gas.

Our proven crude oil reserves total nearly 850 billion barrels and there is a reserves-to-production ratio of more than 80 years. These reserves are much more accessible than those in other, high-cost regions of the world. Also, advances in technology continue to make oil a cleaner, safer fuel, so that it can meet increasingly tighter environmental regulations, as well as conforming to the broader demands of sustainable development. Therefore, our Member Countries possess the reserve strength to cope with the forecast rises in demand in the coming decades.

It would seem logical, therefore, for consumers to expect to get most of their oil from OPEC’s Member Countries.

However, unjustified fears exist about security of supply and over-dependence on specific regions for crude oil. The reasons for this are an unfortunate mix of fact and fiction. The fact is that the world’s oil reserves are concentrated mainly in developing countries, while most customers are located in industrialised nations. The fiction is the belief by some people that developing countries cannot be relied upon to act in a consistent, honourable way in international trade and commerce.

These people refer us back to the events of the 1970s, to support their case. But they over-simplify these events, they rarely have a detailed knowledge of them and they overlook the fact that they actually happened 30 years ago and that the world has moved on since then.

These unjustified fears paradoxically can themselves make the oil market a less secure place, by resulting in decisions and actions that contribute to distortions in the market. The most notable distortion is that OPEC has around four-fifths of the world’s crude oil reserves, but accounts for only about two-fifths of its output.

Running away from realities, as a result of misperceptions and fears, will not solve anyone’s problems. Instead, it will only add to them.

I wish to assure you that fears about OPEC’s integrity are groundless. OPEC has demonstrated repeatedly its firm commitment to the three elements I mentioned earlier: security of supply, security of demand and fair, stable prices. The most recent example of this occurred earlier this year, with the hostilities in Iraq. Many people had predicted that this would lead to a sudden steep rise in oil prices and a period of protracted volatility. But this did not occur. OPEC ensured that the market was kept well-supplied with oil at all times. Indeed, at around the same time, there were serious unexpected cutbacks in output from two other leading oil producers, and the impact of these on world oil prices was again successfully handled by our Organization, with support from some leading non-OPEC producers.

The principal issue is how the world chooses to manage its finite oil resources. OPEC knows, through both intuition and experience, that it does not operate in a vacuum. If it wants to sell its oil, then it must attract buyers. And it does not attract buyers by scaring them off, or being unreliable. As oil-producing, developing countries, OPEC’s Members are heavily dependent on a steady flow of income from petroleum sales to help them develop their economies on a sustainable basis. It is in their best interests to ensure that the oil market performs in a stable and orderly fashion at all times. They have nothing to gain from rocking the boat. OPEC realises that its market-stabilisation measures are most effective when they receive widespread support from within the industry. The boundaries between OPEC and non-OPEC producers and between producers and consumers should not be allowed to neutralise OPEC’s actions. It is a process of interdependence. Producers need consumers and consumers need producers. Companies in-between provide the dynamics, while conferences and seminars create opportunities for constructive dialogue. They all have an important role to play.

Reason, equity and compromise should be the guiding principles when there are diverging interests. For example, people who are concerned about security of supply should acknowledge, at the same time, the need by producers for steady, predictable demand; this is vital, among other things, for the process of making sound investment decisions for the future. Also, while we in OPEC would not question the right of sovereign states to devise their domestic fiscal regimes, we believe that, if a government imposes a 70 or 80 per cent tax on petrol, it should at least admit this when oil prices are high and not just stand aside and let oil producers take the blame. Further, on the question of the deregulation of energy markets, what does this really mean? They are not being totally deregulated, otherwise there would be anarchy and chaos. To what extent, therefore, are they being deregulated and in whose ultimate interest? We all need to live by rules, but they must be the right rules — fair, balanced, consistent, transparent and the product of consultation among, at least, the most affected parties.

Turning to oil prices, these will only be sustainable and useful to the market if they are at levels that balance the contrasting requirements of producers and consumers. OPEC has identified a range of US $22–28 a barrel for its Reference Basket of seven crudes that has won widespread acceptance in the market over the past three years, and it periodically adjusts its production levels to stay within this adopted price band. This has contributed greatly to stability, countering heavy pressure on the market’s equilibrium at both ends of the pricing spectrum. Destabilising factors are not just the result of developments in the market, such as news of unexpected inventory levels or refinery bottlenecks. They can also come about through natural disasters, outbreaks of hostilities or accidents, even when they happen far from oil installations. Whatever the case, they require timely remedial action by OPEC, and we seek to provide this, to the best of our ability.

This also has benefits for the longer term, since stability provides a sound base for investment in future production capacity. This has three elements to it. First, it must meet the forecast absolute increase in demand, which I outlined earlier. Secondly, it must see that exhausted reserves are replaced, as and when necessary. And thirdly, it must ensure that oil-producing nations always have sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply.

Our projections indicate that OPEC Member Countries may need to spend nearly $100 bn by 2010 and as much as $200 bn by 2020 to meet the future demand for oil in full. It will require a concerted effort by the industry at large to attract these sums.

Ladies and gentlemen,

I have been privileged to have this opportunity to speak to you about OPEC’s role in the petroleum industry, as we seek to face the challenges that will arise in the early 21st century. These revolve around ensuring that our Member Countries are able, at all times, to meet the world’s steadily growing demand for clean, safe petroleum in a stable, well-ordered market, founded upon transparency, equity and a readiness for constructive dialogue. We will do everything within our power to meet this commitment.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/320-22-october-2003.html"
"2003-09-11","Ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to begin by congratulating Professor Robert Mabro and his team, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Oxford Energy Seminar. The Seminar is widely regarded as one of the premier events on the international energy calendar. This is why energy experts from across the world make their annual pilgrimage to this fine historic centre of learning, to take part in it. The Seminar provides government ministers, captains of industry and renowned academics with an unparalleled opportunity to pass on the wisdom of their years to a younger generation, who can contribute to the discussions with their fertile minds, their energy and their optimism for the future and who, in turn, might one day themselves become government ministers, captains of industry and academics. OPEC attaches great value to the seminar, for its relentless pursuit of excellence among participants of the highest calibre.

As you all know, the subject of my address today is the challenges facing OPEC in the medium and long terms and, here, I doubt that there will be any disagreement when I say that these challenges are not only complex but vary widely in magnitude and scope. I shall now endeavour to enumerate some of these challenges, but without attaching any level of priority to any of them.

Let us begin with the first one, namely the challenge of supplying consumers, from both the rich, developed and the poorer, developing nations of the world, with the important portion of the oil they need and when they need it. In practice, this is easier said than done. First of all, how much oil will be needed? The reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model, OWEM, indicates that world oil demand will rise from 76 million barrels a day in 2000 to 89 mb/d in 2010 and 107 mb/d in 2020 — this is on the assumption that world energy demand will grow by an annual average of around two per cent during this 20-year period.

OPEC has four-fifths of the world’s proven crude oil reserves — nearly 850 billion barrels. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the Organization will supply most of the crude to the market in the years ahead, a market in which oil is expected to remain the leading energy source.

This, in fact, contrasts with the situation today, when OPEC accounts for less than two-fifths of current world production, and this is where our second challenge is to be found. Simple logic tells us that this imbalance will eventually be corrected and that OPEC will then supply the majority of the world’s crude. However, we have been saying this for many years and it seems somehow to be a case of “tomorrow never comes”! Continued advances in technology, together with price defence policies, have encouraged the rapid development of non-OPEC oil and have helped perpetuate this longstanding imbalance. In the short-term, non-OPEC producers are taking the lion’s share of the market – to the extent that even the IEA has observed that OPEC has a problem with the loss in its market share – but there is a limit to this process, and this is provided by the absolute quantity of non-OPEC reserves. In the not-too-distant future, non-OPEC output will reach a plateau. But this imbalance is the reason why the Organization strives so hard to achieve concrete co-operation with its non-OPEC counterparts – efforts which, in OPEC’s view, have begun to bear fruit.

Our reference case sees OPEC’s market share in 2010 as being about the same as in 2000, at 40 per cent. Nevertheless, during this decade, it is projected to actually fall, for a while, below this figure, with just 37 per cent being forecast for 2005. This is, indeed, what is happening at the present time, with weaker-than-expected global energy demand. Nevertheless, the outlook is expected to improve for OPEC during the second decade of the 21st Century, with the projected market share at 44 per cent in 2015 and 49 per cent in 2020. In absolute terms, according to our reference case, OPEC production, including natural gas liquids, is expected to rise from 30 million barrels a day in 2000 to 36 mb/d in 2010 and to 52 mb/d in 2020.

However, the situation extends beyond the issue of who actually produces the oil, to the issue of oil’s share in the world energy mix, and this is where our third challenge appears. Over the past decade or so, oil’s traditional dominance has been put under pressure on environmental grounds, particularly in the context of the UN-sponsored climate change negotiations. There have also been longer-standing efforts among some consuming nations to diversify energy sources away from oil, on so-called “strategic grounds”. The chief beneficiary of all of this has been gas. Our reference case shows that the use of gas will almost double in the period 2000 to 2020 and its share in the global energy mix will rise from 23 per cent to 28 per cent. However, this will still be ten percentage points below oil’s share of 38 per cent in 2020; in fact, oil’s share will have dipped by only a marginal amount since 2000 — less than two percentage points — according to our projections. OPEC, needless to say, has huge reserves of both oil and gas.

Let me briefly refer to renewables here, since there are widespread calls for these to be developed and brought to the market as soon as possible — we heard such calls, for example, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg last year. Nevertheless, as the Summit itself recognised, the technology required for the large-scale commercial usage of renewables is still years, or even decades, away; therefore, all other available, suitable resources must be enhanced and utilised. Petroleum is already well-placed to provide such energy in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of rich and poor nations alike.

Advances in petroleum technology continue to make oil and gas cleaner fuels, and these advances are accompanied by improved infrastructure and transport, particularly for gas. The successful development of carbon dioxide sequestration technology will, for example, ensure that the use of petroleum is entirely compatible with sustainable growth and that it will continue to serve the needs of mankind for decades to come.

The fourth and fifth challenges are closely related to the first challenge, which is the need to meet an absolute rise in world oil demand.

The fourth notes that exhausted reserves must be replaced, as and when necessary, in addition to increasing production capacity to meet the actual growth in demand, and the fifth acknowledges the desirability of oil-producing nations always having sufficient spare capacity available to cope with sudden, unexpected shortages in supply, in the interests of maintaining market stability for the benefit of all concerned.

The sixth challenge binds together the first five, in that it tackles the issue of financing the producers’ ability to meet expected future oil demand — investment. Our projections indicate that OPEC Member Countries may need to spend nearly US$100 billion by 2010 and as much as US$200 billion by 2020 to meet the future demand for oil in full. It will require a concerted effort by the industry at large to attract these sums. This task is made more difficult by the existence of many areas of uncertainty affecting the clarity and consistency of future world oil demand, and, clearly, the magnitude of these uncertainties increases as we venture further into the future. These uncertainties include changing regulations, fiscal regimes, strategic and political factors, evolving life-styles, natural disasters and, of course, human error. Countering these uncertainties requires transparency, consultation, meticulous planning and careful scheduling across the industry.

It also requires market stability, both now and in the future, and this is our seventh challenge. Indeed, market stability has been one of the biggest challenges facing OPEC for many years. To help us meet this challenge, we introduced our price band mechanism three years ago, with the aim of keeping the average price of the OPEC Reference Basket between US$22 a barrel and US$28/bbl, which we have identified as a range that balances the interests of consumers and producers alike. We use our production agreements to do this. The mechanism constitutes a highly effective part of our market stabilisation measures. It supports market stability, it has done away with extreme price volatility, much to the benefit of both producers and consumers, and it serves to encourage investment in the industry. The success of our mechanism can be judged from the fact that, since its inception, the Basket has averaged around US$26/bbl, which is well within the limits of the band, and this has occurred during a period when there have been serious crises at both ends of the pricing spectrum.

It must be stressed here that these challenges are not OPEC’s alone – a fact which brings us to the eighth challenge. OPEC has welcomed the support our production agreements have received from many leading non-OPEC producers in recent years, and this has clearly made them more effective. Generally speaking, cooperation is essential for the welfare of the industry as a whole, both now and in the future, and this should involve all parties — producers and consumers, as well as the multinational oil companies and financial institutions. Much progress has been made in the past decade, from simple bilateral contact to large international gatherings. Cooperation is also necessary for realising a broader energy vision, which embraces such important universal human concepts as sustainable development and environmental harmony. The need to raise the level of cooperation, therefore, constitutes a very real challenge for OPEC and, of course, all other parties involved in oil activities.

In conclusion, OPEC, with its huge reserves, is expected to be the natural supplier of petroleum to world markets for the foreseeable future, while petroleum will continue to be the dominant source of energy. This means that, if we are to meet our obligation to satisfy the regular needs of the market and provide adequate cover for unusual or extreme situations, such as natural disasters and conflicts, so that order and stability can be maintained at all times, in the interests of both producers and consumers, whilst maintaining our commitment to the pressing demands of sustainable development, which will see us produce cleaner, safer fuels to help preserve the environment and assist in the process of eradicating poverty, we will all have to work together overcome the challenges which I have just enumerated.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/321-11-september-2003.html"
"2003-09-08","Ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to deliver this speech on producer-consumer cooperation at the 11th Annual Middle East Petroleum and Gas Conference, here in Dubai. Dubai, of course, is part of the OPEC family, being one of the seven states forming the United Arab Emirates, and so it is an extra special pleasure for me to speak to you here.

The session I am addressing is called: “OPEC-IEA: defining a new path of cooperation between consumers and producers”. I welcome this opportunity to speak on cooperation, because this topic is of utmost importance to OPEC. The recent advances, that have been made in the relationship between OPEC and the International Energy Agency, are just part of the wide-ranging cooperation that should exist within the industry, and this should involve all the major energy producers and consumers, energy companies, financial institutions and other interested parties. I am sure that the other speaker in this session would agree with this — my friend and opposite number at the IEA, Claude Mandil, who took up the post of Executive Director of the Paris-based agency seven months ago.

I believe he would also support the following general observations I am going to make about the dynamics of cooperation, before we look at the underlying issues in depth.

Cooperation is a means to an end, and not the end itself. In other words, the road must lead somewhere. We have to know where we are going. It is not sufficient just to reach the road.

Cooperation is a two-way process, with suggestions of “give-and-take”, “listening to the views of others”, “seeking the common ground” and so on. For example, consumers who are concerned about security of supply should accept that, conversely, producers are concerned about security of demand.

The word “cooperation” can so easily be used in a routine, almost thoughtless manner. People merely pay lip-service to it. They become complacent. The word loses its vital edge. In reality, however, to be truly effective, the concept of cooperation, as well as its practice, needs to be kept fresh and alive at all times, and well-targeted. We need to take cooperation seriously and endeavour to apply it at all times.

And effective cooperation has a long-term dimension to it. This, in turn, requires perseverance, steadfastness and the ability to successfully handle challenging impulses that may arise along the way; and yet, at the same time, it must accommodate evolving trends.

Failure to heed these general observations can compromise discussions on cooperation, before they have even had a chance to get off the ground.

With this in mind, what are we actually looking at, when we refer to cooperation in the petroleum industry? Why is it important? What do we mean by it?

In its most simplistic form, cooperation should play an important role in the process of getting petroleum to consumers. In any marketing environment, there is the constant quest to improve efficiency and effectiveness and to remain one step ahead of the competition; every tool at one’s disposal should be used in this process, subject to moral and ethical considerations. A healthy relationship between buyers and sellers is crucial, and this rides hand-in-hand with cooperation.

Petroleum is no exception to this. In fact, due to the pre-eminent position of petroleum as an energy source at the heart of the global economy, it is vital to ensure that it reaches consumers in the most efficient and effective manner. Here we encounter such parameters as cost, logistics and security, as well as conflicts between short-term and long-term targets. There are also the benefits crude oil has over other commercial energy sources — accessibility, versatility, transportability, cost, etc — and the rising profile of gas, especially for environmental reasons. On top of this, there is the broader energy vision, embracing such perspectives as sovereign rights, sustainable development and environmentalism. And finally, there are the deep-rooted, longstanding differences, misunderstandings, rivalries — call them what you will — between the different parties in the industry; these are most pronounced between producers, where they are essentially South-based, and consumers, where they are essentially North-based.

When you bring these factors altogether, when you go back to basics and say: “I want to get oil to the consumer” or “I want to get gas to the consumer”, and when you are confronted by the confusion, the conflicts, the complexities and the costs, then the case for cooperation becomes compelling.

How does this apply itself in practice?

Let us begin by looking at the near term.

There are big variations in the extent and the intensity of cooperation, particularly as you move along the upstream/downstream spectrum, which includes exploration, development, extraction, processing, transport and distribution, as well as the sales and marketing that binds these elements together. There can also be critical economic, political and strategic dimensions, as well as the basic geophysical and geographical ones. In the oil industry, the most blatant manifestation of this spectral movement comes in the form of producing countries shifting downstream and international oil companies seeking upstream access.

With the vast majority of day-to-day activities, cooperation takes place as a matter of course, with nobody noticing that it is actually happening. However, sometimes there are notable differences among the parties involved or it is necessary to involve a broader cross-section of the industry in a matter, or it could simply be the case that an in-depth look at an issue is required. Then you become aware of the dynamics of cooperation.

Conferences can provide the means of achieving breakthroughs on such occasions, or for extending our horizons, and they are greatly to be welcomed, especially when, like this one, they have sessions devoted to cooperation.

There are, moreover, two recent notable advances in the cause of cooperation, at an institutional level.

The first is the steady development of the role of the International Energy Forum, which was established in the early 1990s with the specific purpose of enhancing producer-consumer dialogue. Since then, it has gone from strength to strength. OPEC has played a prominent role in its formation and growth. Indeed, the Forum’s permanent secretariat is being set up in one of our Member Countries, Saudi Arabia, while, just a fortnight ago, a Working Group Meeting of this body was held at the OPEC Secretariat in Vienna.

And the second is much closer to home, as far as this session is concerned. This is the strengthening of the relationship between OPEC and the IEA. We held our first-ever joint press conference at the 17th World Petroleum Congress in Rio de Janeiro in September last year, when we emphasised the many areas of consensus that existed between our two organisations on energy matters, as well as highlighting our growing level of open and frank communications. On 25 June this year, we organised — again for the first time — a joint workshop. This was on oil investment prospects and took place at our Vienna Secretariat.

Cooperation, in short, is central to OPEC’s thinking — and has been for many years. Without it, the impact of our market-stabilisation measures would be diminished. Our production agreements have been receiving valuable support from many leading non-OPEC oil producers, and the market at large has benefited from this. Moreover, our close relationship with these producers, as well as the feedback we have received from consumers, has assisted us in the drawing-up of agreements which are realistic and practical.

The core of these agreements consists of collective and individual output ceilings for our Members that are aimed at keeping crude oil prices within the limits defined by our price band mechanism, at US $22–28 a barrel for our Reference Basket. This mechanism was introduced three years ago, with a price band that has been carefully calculated to balance the interests of producers and consumers. If prices begin to settle outside the limits of the band, then the mechanism is triggered. The mechanism thus combines the need for flexibility with the need for a realistic target. Since its inception, the Basket has averaged around $26/b, well within the limits of the band, and this has occurred during a period of heavy pressure — upward and downward pressure — on the price structure. The price band mechanism, therefore, has been very successful and has been well-received by the industry.

From all of this, the importance of a high level of cooperation and dialogue to the successful operation of today’s petroleum industry is clear. But what of tomorrow? Some people maintain that cooperation has an even bigger role to play for the future.

The prospects for petroleum are very bright in the early decades of the 21st century. The reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model (OWEM) predicts that world energy demand will grow by an annual average of around two per cent up to 2020. It sees a marginal drop in oil’s share of the energy mix during this 20-year period, from 40.1 per cent in 2000 to 38.4 per cent. Nevertheless, oil demand will rise from 76 million barrels a day in 2000 to 107 mb/d in 2020.

With non-OPEC oil production likely to reach a plateau, OPEC’s Member Countries will be expected to satisfy most of the projected new demand, due to these countries’ strong resource base of low-cost reserves. OWEM’s projections see OPEC producing 52 mb/d in 2020, a share of almost 49 per cent of global supply.

OPEC is also well-endowed with gas reserves, and these will serve to good effect as the use of gas almost doubles over the next 20 years, according to our projections. Gas’s share of the energy mix will rise from just over 23 per cent in 2000 to 28 per cent in 2020, overtaking that of solids, which will fall to 25 per cent. This is because gas has a more favourable environmental profile among the fossil fuels, and is a reliable and highly efficient source of power generation. It is now relatively low in cost to produce, although still expensive to transport to consumers. In all, about two-thirds of the world’s commercial energy is expected to come from petroleum — oil and gas together — in 2020.

With regard to the understandable calls for the development of renewable sources of energy, notably at last year’s World Summit in Johannesburg, the fact remains that the technology for this is still in its infancy. As was recognised by the Summit, the setting-up of an infrastructure for renewable energy is still too expensive to have a fixed goal attributed to it, at the risk of real, workable solutions. Therefore, while the technology is being developed, all other available, suitable resources must be accessed, enhanced and utilised.

Petroleum is already well-placed to provide such energy. Advances in petroleum technology continue to make oil and gas cleaner fuels, and this is accompanied by improved infrastructure and transport, particularly for gas. The successful development of carbon dioxide sequestration technology will ensure that the use of fossil fuels is entirely compatible with sustainable growth and that they will continue to serve the needs of mankind for decades to come. OPEC can, therefore, make a major contribution to an evolving energy system, which is closely tied to the demands of sustainable development.

However, massive investment is required for this. This relates to not just the upstream sector, but also to the downstream sector and transportation, as well as to the development and application of technology. Our projections estimate spending of nearly $100 billion by 2010 and $209 bn by 2020 for our Member Countries alone, in order to sustain their existing production capacities, as well as cater for the projected large rise in demand. For the high-cost, non-OPEC producers, investment forecasts are much higher — at around $600 bn by 2010 and over $860 bn ten years later.

When looking more closely into investment, we find ourselves facing many areas of uncertainty affecting the clarity and consistency of demand, including changing regulations, fiscal regimes, strategic and political factors, evolving life-styles, natural disasters and, of course, human error. There is the need for stability and harmony in the long term, as well as clarity and consistency about future levels of demand. Meeting the challenges presented by all these factors requires transparency, consultation, meticulous planning, careful scheduling and an underlying sense of equity. This involves all the major energy producers and consumers, energy companies, financial institutions and other interested parties.

In other words, it involves cooperation on an unprecedented, massive, multilateral and sustained basis. We are on the right track for this, with the progress that has been made in recent years, through, for example, the OPEC-IEA relationship, the International Energy Forum, non-OPEC support for our production agreements and such meetings as this. But the stakes are so high that we need to shift up a gear, as far as cooperation is concerned, if the petroleum industry is to continue performing its valuable service to mankind in the coming decades.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/322-8-september-2003.html"
"2003-08-21","Ladies and gentlemen,

I should like to begin by thanking the organisers, the Japan Cooperation Centre for the Middle East, for inviting me to deliver this keynote lecture at their 28th annual conference.

In fact, I should also like to emphasise the two middle words in their name — “Cooperation Centre” — because this sums up a fundamental part of OPEC’s philosophy in recent years — cooperation. And, when the words “Cooperation Centre” link “Japan” with the “Middle East”, where most of OPEC’s Member Countries are situated, then I feel that we are already well on our towards having a productive meeting today!

OPEC — and, in particular, the Middle East — has had a long and fruitful relationship in the energy sector with Japan, which is the world’s second-largest importer of crude oil and consumer of refined products and the third-largest importer of natural gas. Petroleum accounts for around three-fifths of Japan’s primary energy, with crude oil alone having a market share of almost 50 per cent. More than 85 per cent of Japan’s crude comes from OPEC’s Member Countries, as well as a significant amount of its imported refined products. Around one-sixth of OPEC’s crude oil exports are destined for Japan. OPEC countries are also major suppliers of liquefied natural gas there.

Our Middle East Members are responsible for nearly all the OPEC petroleum that goes to Japan, although significant quantities also come from Indonesia, which, of course, is physically closer than the other OPEC countries.

The OPEC-Japan relationship is an extremely important one. This is felt even here in Vienna, where, for many years, there has been close contact and fruitful dialogue on energy issues between the OPEC Secretariat and the Japanese Embassy, headed by the Ambassador himself. Indeed, it was with the generous assistance of Staff from the Embassy that, last September, we held a Meeting of our Conference of Oil Ministers in Japan’s second-biggest city, Osaka — with the gracious consent of the Government of Japan, Prefecture of Osaka and City of Osaka. This was timed to occur in the run-up to the Eighth International Energy Forum, which was also held in that city and whose central premise is the enhancement of dialogue between energy producers and consumers. A meeting of the recently formed Gas Exporting Countries Forum, in which OPEC Members are well-represented, was similarly arranged for that week in Osaka. As well as the direct benefit our Organization derived from the meetings themselves, we took the opportunity to build upon the excellent relations that already exist between OPEC and Japan, as well as enjoying the warm hospitality provided by our hosts.

At an official dinner held during that week, Japan’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Her Excellency Yoriko Kawaguchi, commented on the relationship, saying that Japan and OPEC countries were faced with common challenges of how to achieve sustainable development using limited energy resources and that there was a need to have closer contact and enhance dialogue in order to effectively address these challenges. This very much echoes our own feelings.

It is clear from all of this that Japan, which produces more than four-fifths of its refined products domestically, relies so heavily upon imported crude oil that even a small change in market conditions can have a significant effect on its domestic economy — an economy which is the world’s second-largest and which has been experiencing many difficulties over the past decade.

Therefore, Japan, more than almost any other country on the planet, requires order and consistency in its crude oil supply, with stable, reasonable prices, as it seeks to end this protracted economic downturn and enter a new era of sustained growth and prosperity.

This fits in very much with OPEC’s way of thinking. We have been around, as an Organization, for a long time — more than four decades — and have first-hand experience of the way the oil market operates in conditions that range from sustained periods of calm to sudden, sharp volatile episodes.

We concluded a long time ago that the market thrives on stability, consistency, transparency and equity and that this can best be achieved in an atmosphere of dialogue and cooperation, involving all the major parties in the market. This was one of the reasons why we were so keen to go to Osaka last year, because the constant theme throughout the meetings there was the need to exchange views and share understanding of topical energy issues, so that we could be better equipped to handle new situations as they arose, to the benefit of the world community at large.

These meetings took place shortly after the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, which had heightened global awareness of the important role the provision of modern energy services can play in the early 21st century, particularly in helping to ease the dire plight of the impoverished nations.

Thus, when we examine the short- and long-term oil price trends in the aftermath of the events in Iraq, we do so in a manner that views oil issues and energy issues in a broader human context.

The short-term oil price trends are with us now. Since the end of the war in Iraq at the beginning of May, there has been a steady strengthening of crude oil prices, from around the middle of the range of OPEC’s price band of US $22–28 per barrel for our Reference Basket to the top end of it and above. This has been partly due to uncertainty about the state of the Iraqi oil industry and the rate at which its oil will flow back onto world markets. But there have also been other factors at play, such as continuing disruptions in some other oil-producing countries, the perception of low stocks worldwide and high natural gas prices in the USA. On top of all this are speculative pressures, which, as usual, have the effect of exaggerating impulses on the market.

At the Meeting of the OPEC Conference three weeks ago, held in our Secretariat in Vienna’s second district, we decided to maintain the current production level of 25.4 million barrels a day for OPEC-10 — that is, OPEC’s Member Countries, excluding Iraq — until our next Meeting on 24 September. This was after examining the demand and supply prospects for the remainder of the year and noting that the market was stable and well-supplied with crude and that prices were within the OPEC band.

However, the Staff at our Secretariat are constantly monitoring market movements, in line with our commitment to achieving and maintaining order and stability. The price band mechanism was introduced in the year 2000, with this in mind. If prices settle outside the limits of the band for a prescribed period — 20 consecutive days above $28/b and ten consecutive days below $22/b — then we will take the appropriate measures to restore them to within the desired range. The mechanism, in other words, combines the need for flexibility with the need for a realistic target. Since its introduction, it has won wide acceptance among producers and consumers alike and, accordingly, has met with a high degree of success.

Because the price band mechanism has now become an established tool of OPEC policy, the clear implication is that it will influence longer-term oil price trends. However, we do not wish to sound complacent about this, since the dynamics of the oil market may require us to revise the range of the band or the way the mechanism operates some time in the future.

The degree to which developments in Iraq may affect the oil market in the years ahead is difficult to tell at the present time. We are as much in the dark about the pattern of events there as any other outside party. We hope, however, that there is an orderly transfer of power — real power — to the Iraqi people themselves in the near future, so that they can quickly become masters of their own destiny. Iraq has a proud OPEC heritage, which I am sure its people are eager to continue. OPEC was formed in Baghdad in September 1960 and Iraq, as one of its five Founder Members, has played a major role in its subsequent struggles to become an established and respected intergovernmental Organization. As the country seeks to rebuild its oil industry and become a frontline player on the world energy stage once again, there is little doubt — within my own mind, at least — that, if left to its own devices, it will wish to do this from within the OPEC family.

We hope that this happens sooner rather than later. This would be in the market’s overriding interest, to ensure that a stable pricing structure is in place if producers are to meet the big rise in oil demand that has been forecast for the opening decades of the 21st century. OPEC — as a group of 11 active Members — will have a big role to play in this. The reference case from OPEC’s World Energy Model (OWEM) predicts that world oil demand will rise from 76 million barrels a day in 2000 to 89 mb/d in 2010 and 107 mb/d in 2020.

It sees a marginal drop in oil’s share of the energy mix during this 20-year period, from 40.1 per cent in 2000 to 38.4 per cent. World energy demand will grow by an annual average of around two per cent up to 2020, with the rise in developing countries being at three-to-four times the rate of that of industrialised countries.

With non-OPEC oil production likely to reach a plateau, OPEC’s Member Countries will be expected to satisfy most of the projected new demand, due to these countries’ strong resource base of low-cost, abundant reserves. OWEM’s projections see OPEC producing 36 mb/d of crude in 2010, which constitutes 40 per cent of global supply, rising to 52 mb/d in 2020, a share of almost 49 per cent.

OPEC is also well-endowed with gas reserves, and these will serve to good effect as the use of gas almost doubles over the next 20 years, according to our projections. Gas’s share of the energy mix will rise from just over 23 per cent in 2000 to 28 per cent in 2020, overtaking that of solids, which will fall to 25 per cent. This is because gas has a more favourable environmental profile among the fossil fuels, and is a reliable and highly efficient source of power generation. It is now relatively low in cost to produce, although still expensive to transport to consumers. In all, about two-thirds of the world’s commercial energy is expected to come from petroleum — oil and gas together — in 2020.

Meeting the challenges presented by all these factors requires transparency, consultation, meticulous planning, careful scheduling and an underlying sense of equity. This involves all the major energy producers and consumers, energy companies, financial institutions and other interested parties. Energy markets are too important to be left to the free market alone, and developing countries need solutions by governments that will guarantee that poor communities can also receive energy at affordable prices.

In conclusion, OPEC, with its strong resource base and vast experience of oil matters, will continue with its longstanding mission of enhancing the welfare of the international oil sector, so as to ensure secure supply, reasonable prices and fair returns to investors, both now and in the future. But, in doing this, it requires the full cooperation of other leading parties in the industry.

This brings me back to where I began the lecture, by emphasising the two words in the middle of the organisers’ name, “Cooperation Centre”. You can now understand why I did this!

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/323-21-august-2003.html"
"2003-07-24","Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen,

Let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to deliver this statement to this Arab Ministerial Meeting on world trade.

The first paragraph of the ‘Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization’ refers to the Parties recognising that their relations in the field of trade and economic endeavour should be conducted with a view to raising standards of living and meeting other economic objectives, while allowing for the optimal use of the world&apos;s resources in accordance with the objective of sustainable development.

And the second paragraph recognises the need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries, especially the least developed ones, secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development.

The world economy could not function without trade. But, if trade is to be conducted on a level playing field, then it must ensure that safeguards are in place, with regard to its domination by powerful global interests.

Arab countries have a rich diversity of economic cultures, interlinked by trading systems that have evolved since the dawn of history. However, this longstanding trading heritage has been steadily marginalized by that of the established international industrial powers. The same is true in many other parts of the developing world.

A major problem within the multilateral trading system over the past two decades has been the move towards substituting the role of development with that of liberalisation. Trade liberalisation, however, should not be allowed to undermine the national policy and development objectives of the WTO.

Developing countries should have the autonomy to develop active policies that stimulate the long-overlooked supply-side of the equation i.e. those policies and policy instruments that give them the ability to diversify their economies and become more competitive.

This should be coupled with changes on the demand side, to help poorer nations gain more effective market access and equitable terms of trade for their exports.

To achieve all of this, the concepts of special and differential treatment and non-reciprocity should be enshrined in the heart of the WTO.

In particular, the concept of special and differential treatment should go beyond the provision of longer transitional periods for developing countries to implement the same rules as developed countries, and should take the form of positive bias within the rules in favour of developing countries. After all, some WTO agreements can already be regarded as being in favour of consumer countries, by carrying provisions that can have negative impacts on developing countries. Obvious examples are textile quotas, agricultural subsidies and intellectual property rights.

One special concern of OPEC — and the majority of our Members are from the Arab world — is the trade in energy services. Here we must make sure that, in the trade talks, the interests of developing countries are properly represented in such important areas as the classification of energy services, the opening-up of our markets and the transfer of technology.

We therefore welcome the activities of the WTO, in providing us with a platform for discussion on issues of such central importance to all nations, at a time when rapid social, political and economic changes are combining to reshape the world.

Therefore, as we look ahead to the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Cancun, we, as developing countries, must prepare ourselves to present our case on all the principal trading issues in a comprehensive, compelling, consistent and coordinated manner.

This is why we are meeting here in Beirut this week.

In this regard, OPEC has applied for observer status to the WTO and I, therefore, seek the support of the Arab countries in obtaining such status.

Thank you.","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/324-24-july-2003.html"
"2003-07-09","​Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,

​I should like to thank the European Energy Foundation for inviting me to address tonight’s dinner debate on the Role of OPEC in the 21st Century.

​Origin and nature of OPEC
​OPEC was created in 1960, based on principles which are as valid today as they were then — despite the vast number of changes we have since experienced in technology, economics, politics and many other aspects of our lives.

​These principles revolve around the coordination of our Member Countries’ oil policies, so as: to ensure price stability in the world oil market; to obtain a stable revenue for oil-producing nations; and to provide a regular, reliable, efficient and economic supply to consuming countries and a fair return to investors in the oil industry.

​Our commitment to these principles was reaffirmed as recently as the year 2000, in the Solemn Declaration that concluded the Second Summit of Heads of State and Government of OPEC Member Countries, which was held in Caracas, Venezuela.

​OPEC’s activities are focused on oil, a commodity that has contributed more than any other form of energy to economic development around the world, over the past century and a half. Analysts agree that hydrocarbons will remain the most important source of energy for decades to come.

​Moreover, we are dedicated to the ideals of last year’s World Summit in Johannesburg, to ensure that energy reaches all people and all nations, rich and poor alike, as an essential element in the sustainable development of mankind.

​OPEC’s mission is not restricted by time or circumstance, however. It is, instead, a permanent one, which is centred around petroleum, but broadens out into the energy industry generally. It involves close cooperation and exchanges with other leading, influential parties in the sector at national and international levels.

​The obvious conclusion from what I have just said is that OPEC is not a cartel, as some people still insist on calling us. Instead, it is an international organization of sovereign states, with a legitimate, permanent and essential mission for both its Member Countries and mankind generally.

​Oil market stability
​I believe that OPEC’s actions over the present difficult period provide a vivid demonstration of the important role the Organization plays in stabilizing the volatile oil market, a role that it will continue to play well into the future.

​We all share a common interest in keeping prices in a moderate range and in avoiding extremes. Accordingly, OPEC developed its price band mechanism at the 109th Meeting of its Conference in March 2000. At that time, it identified US $22–28 a barrel as the price range that balances the needs of consumers and producers. The success of the mechanism can be judged from the fact that, since its inception, the OPEC Reference Basket has averaged $25.30/b, which is slightly above the centre of the band.

​The price band mechanism has faced a stern test over the past seven months, in the light of the supply disruptions in Venezuela, Iraq and, to a lesser extent, Nigeria.

​The Venezuelan oil industry strike, which began last December and extended into January, withdrew a startling 2.8 million barrels a day from the market. This pushed prices to more than $3/b above the band. In response, OPEC rapidly organized an Extraordinary Meeting of its Conference, which raised the OPEC-10 production ceiling by 1.5 mb/d and restored some balance to a potentially destabilizing market.

​It is important to note that, while the price band mechanism allows for increments of 500,000 b/d to be added to the market when prices rise above 28/b, the OPEC Conference, recognizing the severity of the situation, agreed to add more than three times that amount. I believe this action shows OPEC’s flexibility, as well as the sincerity of its commitment to maintaining market stability.

​However, despite OPEC’s best efforts, the oil price continued to sit stubbornly above the price band throughout the first quarter of this year. The main cause of this was the so-called ‘war premium’, based on speculation about the effect a possible war in Iraq would have on the oil market. At its 11 March Conference, OPEC provided assurances to the market that its Member Countries had sufficient capacity to cover any shortfall in supply that might occur. In response, consumer nations — such as Japan, members of the European Union and the United States of America — as well as consumer groups — such as the International Energy Agency — expressed confidence in OPEC being able to manage such a shortfall. Thus, OPEC could once again calm a jittery market and prevent prices from spiralling upwards.

​Nine days later, the war began in Iraq, halting that country’s production of roughly 2 mb/d. This loss was compounded by an almost simultaneous disruption of supplies from Nigeria, due to unrest in its oil-producing Delta region. This resulted in a total withdrawal of more than 2.5 mb/d of crude from the market. OPEC rapidly convened a Consultative Meeting of its Conference on 24 April. Its Member Countries decided to raise the output ceiling to meet the needs of the market, with effect from 1 June, while at the same time reducing actual production to reduce the threat of over-supply heading into a period of seasonal low demand.

​Throughout this period of high prices and supply disruptions, non-OPEC producers were, in the main, supportive of OPEC’s efforts, but were unable to put any additional oil to the market, because of export limitations and lack of spare capacity. This period demonstrated the direct benefit consumer nations derive from OPEC decisions to make the necessary costly — and risky — investment in spare capacity to prevent future supply disruptions. It clearly underlined OPEC’s commitment to security of supply.

​Uncertainty about the situation in Iraq led OPEC to adopt a “wait-and-see” attitude at its most recent Conference in Doha one month ago, when it decided to maintain its previous production levels until it could reassess the situation at an Extraordinary Conference it arranged for 31 July. Assured that OPEC is constantly monitoring the situation, the market has responded favourably to this.

​OPEC has also repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that prices do not fall too far. The most notable recent case of this concerned the price weakness that followed the tragic events of September 11, when OPEC used the price band as a rallying point to coordinate efforts with several important non-OPEC producers — namely, Angola, Mexico, Norway, Oman and Russia — to stabilize the market by agreeing to make production or export cuts.

​Although non-OPEC producers do not have the spare capacity to assist OPEC in covering supply shortages, they can at least cut production when prices are especially low. Such cuts are painful for all producers, non-OPEC and OPEC alike, and therefore should be shared equally among all producers. Fortunately, responsible producers recognize this fact.

​I have just one last word to make about oil prices and stability. This is that many governments, especially within the EU, have the ability — even more so than producing countries — to substantially lower the prices their citizens pay for finished products. This is because, in some countries, only 20 per cent of the price of finished products, such as petroleum, goes to the producing countries, while as much as 70 per cent ends up in government coffers through high taxes. For this reason, it would seem reasonable, at times of high oil prices, for governments to develop a mechanism to adjust their tax rates on finished products to ease the burden on their constituents. I am sure that this would prove to be a very popular move!

​Oil and the future
​I should now like to turn to the challenges of the future. The latest projections from the OPEC World Energy Model, OWEM, indicate that fossil fuels will remain the world’s dominant energy source in the next two decades and that they will meet more than 90 per cent of world energy requirements. As for non-fossil fuels, nuclear energy is forecast to continue its decline, while hydropower is expected to grow rapidly in developing countries. Renewable energy will also increase from its very low base, although at rates lower than those set out in the EU green paper on energy security.

​Among the fossil fuels, oil and gas in particular will continue to play the leading roles in meeting world energy demand. OWEM predicts that world oil demand will rise to 89 mb/d in 2010, compared with around 76 mb/d in 2000, and to 107 mb/d in 2020. As non-OPEC oil production reaches a plateau in the first two decades of the century, OPEC Member Countries — with more than 75 per cent of global proven crude oil reserves — are expected to be called on to satisfy most of the new demand. Our projections see OPEC producing 36 mb/d of crude in 2010, which is more than 40 per cent of global supply, rising to over 52 mb/d in 2020, when OPEC’s share will exceed 48 per cent.

​Of course, with the projected expansion in both oil and gas use, there is a constant need for producers to not only replace depleted reserves, but also expand production to meet the world’s increasing energy needs. The level of investment our Member Countries alone will need to make is enormous. Our projections estimate a figure of nearly $100 billion by 2010 and a substantial $209 bn by 2020. However, for the high-cost, non-OPEC producers, investment forecasts are much greater than this — around $600 bn by 2010 and over $860 bn ten years later.

​Oil and the environment
​In speaking of the future, it is also necessary to dispel another common, but mistaken notion that fossil fuels are a dirty form of energy. Possibly this can be traced to the old days of coal. However, the situation has improved greatly in recent years and this will continue into the future. Currently, natural gas is a well-used, cleaner-burning form of energy, while new technologies, such as CO2 sequestration, will allow gas and other hydrocarbons, such as oil, to be burned at even the zero emissions level. It is important to remember that fossil fuels are a product — and gift — of nature. Technical advances are allowing us to use this gift without damaging nature in return. Today, it is only a question of cost.

​Oil and cooperation
​The task of stabilising the oil market and guaranteeing secure demand and supply, with reasonable prices and fair returns to investors, cannot be carried out by OPEC alone. Cooperation is necessary. Cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. Cooperation between producers and consumers. Cooperation among organizations.

​Cooperation is central to OPEC’s thinking. Recently, eight non-OPEC oil-producing nations have become observers of our Organization’s activities and this includes attendance at our Ministerial Conferences. Before these Conferences, we hold meetings to exchange ideas among our Ministers and the representatives of observer countries. We also promote workshops and bilateral meetings between observers and OPEC.

​Moreover, contacts and action plans are being made among producers and consumers. The Permanent Secretariat of the International Energy Forum has now been established in Riyadh. The relationship with the IEA has been strengthened through different events, such as high-level bilateral meetings, joint press conferences and the Joint Workshop on Oil Investment Prospects we held at our Secretariat in Vienna just a fortnight ago. We have also had meetings and seminars with the Energy Treaty Secretariat and have very close contact with UNCTAD and WTO, just as we do with UN bodies that deal with the environment, climate change and sustainable development.

​Iraq
​So far, I have only touched upon the situation in Iraq. Two things are clear, however. The first is that Iraq is, without any doubt, a committed Member of the Organization. In fact, it is not only a Member but also a Founder Member of OPEC. And secondly, Iraq today is in an extremely challenging, transitory situation, where it is facing many difficulties. Its first goal will be to meet domestic consumption. Once this has been achieved, it will then work to restore its pre-war level of exports. The precise timing of this is unclear, although personally I believe it will be before the end of the year. Both OPEC and its individual Member Countries have a strong desire to see Iraq return to normalcy, as well as an expressed willingness to assist the country in overcoming the technical and managerial problems that have beset its oil sector.

​Regarding Iraq’s participation in OPEC decisions, I would say that, since OPEC is an international organization of sovereign nations, it must be patient and wait until Iraq has formed a sovereign government. Once this has been achieved, then the country’s representatives can take their rightful places at the table with other Member Countries. We look forward to the time when Iraq is able to return in a fully active capacity to the Organization which it was instrumental in setting up more than 40 years ago.

​Conclusion
​At the beginning of my speech, I mentioned that producers and consumers share common goals. Throughout the course of my talk, I have touched upon these goals. In closing, I should like to spell them out more clearly. These goals are: stable prices, secure supply and sufficient investment. Stable prices allow consumers and producers to meet today’s needs. Secure supply prevents disruptions that can send prices spiralling and stall economic growth. And sufficient investment ensures that we will be able to provide the necessary oil to meet the growing energy requirement of the future.

​These are the common goals we share — although at times this fact might be obscured when we view the challenges too strongly from one perspective. To achieve these goals will require the efforts of all of us. But I can assure you that the future looks very bright, if we seize the opportunity to work together.

​Thank you.​​","https://www.opec.org/speech-detail/325-9-july-2003.html"
